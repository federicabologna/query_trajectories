Bai, Moonseon Jang, N. J. Lee, Thi Thu Ha Nguyen, Mooyoung Jung, Jeong Yeon Hwang, H. Shim\n## Abstract\nAntibody discovery by phage display consists of two phases, i.e., the binding phase and the amplification phase. Ideally, the selection process is dominated by the former, and all the retrieved clones are amplified equally during the latter. In reality, the amplification efficiency of antibody fragments varies widely among different sequences and, after a few rounds of phage display panning, the output repertoire often includes rapidly amplified sequences with low or no binding activity, significantly diminishing the efficiency of antibody isolation. In this work, a novel synthetic single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library with complementarity-determining region (CDR) diversities aimed at improved amplification efficiency was designed and constructed. A previously reported synthetic scFv library with low, non-combinatorial CDR diversities was panned against protein A superantigen, and the library repertoires before and after the panning were analyzed by next generation sequencing. The enrichment or depletion patterns of CDR sequences after panning served as the basis for the design of the new library. Especially for CDR-H3 with a higher and more random diversity, a machine learning method was applied to predict potential fast-amplified sequences among a simulated sequence repertoire. In a direct comparison with the previous generation library, the new library performed better against a panel of antigens in terms of the number of binders isolated, the number of unique sequences, and/or the speed of binder enrichment. Our results suggest that the amplification-centric design of sequence diversity is a valid strategy for the construction of highly functional phage display antibody libraries.\n",

The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.",

                    "text": "Phage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

                    "text": "Universal antibody phage display libraries, typically consisting of over ten billion unique sequences, have become a valuable source for discovery of mAbs against any types of targets. According to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library. By using mono-or trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIM technology) as building blocks, 84,85 diversified CDRs can be synthesized in a high-throughput manner, such as array-based oligonucleotide synthesis and Slonomics. 86,87 In the TRIM technology, each amino acid is encoded by a defined codon. Therefore, amino acid distribution at the desired position can be precisely defined. Moreover, because the codon for each amino acid is selected for optimal antibody expression, the functional library size is increased. In the natural antibody repertoire, the diversity of CDRs, except CDRH3, is a collection of defined sequences that exhibit canonical structures. Compared with the traditional column-based DNA synthesis approaches in which one single gene is produced per column, the high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies allow parallel synthesis of a large number of predetermined sequences in the same footprint on a silicon-based chip. 88,89 This enables not only removal of liability motifs that impact developability, but also precise mimic of the",

The six CDRs were then reassembled in a single light and heavy chain framework that is well-presented in human repertoire and wellexpressed in bacterial host cells. 94 This strategy overcomes the drawback with conventional na\u00efve antibody phage libraries in which part of the diversity might be lost due to low expression and/or display level of certain germline genes in prokaryotic system. The n-CoDeR library was used to discover five mAbs and their derivatives that entered clinical trials. [126][127][128][129][130] In our experience, high hit rate (>90%) can be readily achieved and antibodies with high affinity (low nanomolar) can be routinely isolated from a large na\u00efve library (library size = 10 12 ) constructed in-house. Depending on the target, 10-20% of total sequences screened are unique.\n\nTaken together, first-generation phage libraries demonstrated that antibody discovery can be performed completely in vitro and antibodies with high affinity and sequence diversity can be isolated directly from phage libraries.",

These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of antibody fusion proteins and higher infectivity due to all wild type pIII molecules on phage particle, resulting in loss of library diversity. In efforts to increase functional library size, several strategies have been developed. For example, anti-tag antibody was used for proofreading panning to select in-frame sequences due to the tag being inframe with the antibody sequence. 177 In the design of the HuCAL GOLD library, the \u03b2-lactamase gene was used to eliminate frame-shifted sequences. 98 Regarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. 100 For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. 93,98 Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. 178 Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design. For the majority of the phage display libraries, V H and V L are randomly rearranged, which agrees with the observation that there is no obvious preference of V H /V L pairing in natural repertories. 179 However, in terms of drug development, since different V H /V L pairings do exhibit very distinct biophysical characteristics, 100,180 attention should be given to the choice of framework pairing.\n\nCompared to in vivo antibody discovery approaches, another advantage of phage display is that the sequence information can be retrieved rapidly and readily. However, this advantage is partially attenuated by the conventional screening approach of characterization of individual clones, in which only a small percentage of sequence information, i.e., the most abundant sequences, from",

The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.\n## Introduction\ncompetitive panning 7,28-30 and sitespecific photocrosslinking. 8 Some other panning strategies, such as cell-based and nanodisc-based panning, have been developed for challenging targets, e.g., multi-spanning membrane proteins. [31][32][33] Moreover, functional selection can be directly integrated in the selection process. 34,35 Although various panning strategies have been developed to meet different antibody discovery goals, the selection procedures are generally well-established and standardized. 36 However, library design is highly variable and plays a central role in phage display-based antibody discovery. In this review, we will briefly summarize the principle of antibody phage display and phage engineering. This review will focus on the design principles of three generations of phage display libraries, as well as several specially designed libraries.\n\n## Phage display\nDisplay of foreign peptide on the bacteriophage surface without affecting phage infection was first described by George P. Smith in 1985. 37 Since then, phage display technology has been extensively applied to various applications, e.g., protein evolution (also known as directed evolution), epitope determination, identification of enzyme substrates, and drug discovery. 38 Since phenotype and genotype are physically linked in a phage display system, protein variants with desired properties can be rapidly selected through panning and the genetic information can be readily extracted. In a phage display system, a library in which diversified peptide or protein variants are displayed on phage surface is constructed (typically 10 10 \u2212 10 12 diversity). Variants with favored properties are enriched during iterative selection cycles. Unique sequences can then be screened for further applications. While the success of phage display has been demonstrated in a wide variety of areas, this review will focus on its application in therapeutic antibody discovery.\n\nAntibody phage display was originally developed in three institutes: Institute of Cell and Tumor Biology at German Cancer Research Center (Germany), 39 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (United Kingdom), 40,41 and Scripps Research Institute (United States). 42,43 Since then, various antibody fragment formats have been commonly used for phage display, such as single chain variable fragment (scFv), 44,45 antigen binding fragment (Fab), 24,46 single-domain antibody (VHH), 47,48 and bispecific antibody fragment.

According to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library. By using mono-or trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIM technology) as building blocks, 84,85 diversified CDRs can be synthesized in a high-throughput manner, such as array-based oligonucleotide synthesis and Slonomics. 86,87 In the TRIM technology, each amino acid is encoded by a defined codon. Therefore, amino acid distribution at the desired position can be precisely defined. Moreover, because the codon for each amino acid is selected for optimal antibody expression, the functional library size is increased. In the natural antibody repertoire, the diversity of CDRs, except CDRH3, is a collection of defined sequences that exhibit canonical structures. Compared with the traditional column-based DNA synthesis approaches in which one single gene is produced per column, the high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies allow parallel synthesis of a large number of predetermined sequences in the same footprint on a silicon-based chip. 88,89 This enables not only removal of liability motifs that impact developability, but also precise mimic of the\n\n## First-generation library\nartificial antibodies can be generated in vitro. Later studies showed that, by generating larger na\u00efve libraries with library size of 10 10 -10 12 , antibodies with low-to sub-nanomolar affinity can be directly isolated. 90,91,93,[114][115][116][117][118] Of note, the large na\u00efve library and related phage display technology developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology has led to approval of six mAbs: adalimumab, 119 belimumab, 120 moxetumomab pasudotox, 121,122 raxibacumab, 123 emapalumab, 124 and tralokinumab. 125 Another example is the n-CoDeR library in which heavy and light chain CDR segments were separately amplified by using primers specific to VH3-23 and VL1-47 germlines. The six CDRs were then reassembled in a single light and heavy chain framework that is well-presented in human repertoire and wellexpressed in bacterial host cells. 94 This strategy overcomes the drawback with conventional na\u00efve antibody phage libraries in which part of the diversity might be lost due to low expression and/or display level of certain germline genes in prokaryotic system. The n-CoDeR library was used to discover five mAbs and their derivatives that entered clinical trials. [126][127][128][129][130] In our experience, high hit rate (>90%) can be readily achieved and antibodies with high affinity (low nanomolar) can be routinely isolated from a large na\u00efve library (library size = 10 12 ) constructed in-house. Depending on the target, 10-20% of total sequences screened are unique.\n\nTaken together, first-generation phage libraries demonstrated that antibody discovery can be performed completely in vitro and antibodies with high affinity and sequence diversity can be isolated directly from phage libraries.\n\n## Conclusions and prospects\nPhage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of\n...\nage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of antibody fusion proteins and higher infectivity due to all wild type pIII molecules on phage particle, resulting in loss of library diversity. In efforts to increase functional library size, several strategies have been developed. For example, anti-tag antibody was used for proofreading panning to select in-frame sequences due to the tag being inframe with the antibody sequence. 177 In the design of the HuCAL GOLD library, the \u03b2-lactamase gene was used to eliminate frame-shifted sequences. 98 Regarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. 100 For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. 93,98 Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. 178 Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design. For the majority of the phage display libraries, V H and V L are randomly rearranged, which agrees with the observation that there is no obvious preference of V H /V L pairing in natural repertories. 179 However, in terms of drug development, since different V H /V L pairings do exhibit very distinct biophysical characteristics, 100,180 attention should be given to the choice of framework pairing.\n\nCompared to in vivo antibody discovery approaches, another advantage of phage display is that the sequence information can be retrieved rapidly and readily. However, this advantage is partially attenuated by the conventional screening approach of characterization of individual clones, in which only a small percentage of sequence information, i.e., the most abundant sequences, from",

This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nFigure 1. Different types of phage display libraries. Phage display technology enables the selection and identification of peptides, antibodies, or enzymes that bind to specific target molecules. This approach entails generating filamentous fusion phages that showcase random foreign peptides or antibodies linked to a phage coat protein. Subsequently, the filamentous phages are assembled into a phage display library comprising random peptide sequences or antibodies. \n\nConstructing a phage display library involves several key steps aimed at generating a diverse repertoire of displayed peptides or proteins for subsequent screening against target molecules. Initially, a source of genetic material encoding the desired peptides or proteins is obtained, which can include synthetic DNA sequences, cDNA libraries, or genomic DNA. Next, this genetic material is ligated into a phagemid vector, which contains the genetic elements necessary for phage display, including a phage coat protein gene fused to the peptide or protein of interest. The ligated DNA is then introduced into competent Escherichia coli cells via transformation, where it undergoes replication and amplification. Following transformation, the bacterial cells are infected with helper phage, which provides the necessary components for packaging the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The infected cells are then cultured to allow for phage production, and the resulting phage display library is harvested by collecting the culture supernatant or lysing the bacterial cells to release the phage particles. The library can be further characterized by sequencing a subset of clones to assess diversity and by performing binding assays to confirm the display of the desired peptides or proteins (Figure 2) [12].",

Since then, numerous phage-derived antibodies have been successfully developed and advanced into clinical studies, resulting in the approval of more than a dozen therapeutic antibodies. These antibodies have demonstrated efficacy across a spectrum of medical conditions, ranging from autoimmune diseases to various cancers. In this article, we provide an in-depth review of the development of phage display libraries as powerful platforms for therapeutic antibody discovery, elucidating the intricate procedures involved in antibody development. Additionally, we conduct a review of the current ntibody drugs for cancer treatment that have been developed using the phage display platform. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges inherent in this technology, offering insights into potential solutions to enhance crucial steps and facilitate more efficient drug discovery in the field of phage display technology.\n## Library Construction\nThe journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.\n...\nThe journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library.

The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nFigure 1. Different types of phage display libraries. Phage display technology enables the selection and identification of peptides, antibodies, or enzymes that bind to specific target molecules. This approach entails generating filamentous fusion phages that showcase random foreign peptides or antibodies linked to a phage coat protein. Subsequently, the filamentous phages are assembled into a phage display library comprising random peptide sequences or antibodies. \n\nConstructing a phage display library involves several key steps aimed at generating a diverse repertoire of displayed peptides or proteins for subsequent screening against target molecules. Initially, a source of genetic material encoding the desired peptides or proteins is obtained, which can include synthetic DNA sequences, cDNA libraries, or genomic DNA. Next, this genetic material is ligated into a phagemid vector, which contains the genetic elements necessary for phage display, including a phage coat protein gene fused to the peptide or protein of interest. The ligated DNA is then introduced into competent Escherichia coli cells via transformation, where it undergoes replication and amplification. Following transformation, the bacterial cells are infected with helper phage, which provides the necessary components for packaging the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The infected cells are then cultured to allow for phage production, and the resulting phage display library is harvested by collecting the culture supernatant or lysing the bacterial cells to release the phage particles. The library can be further characterized by sequencing a subset of clones to assess diversity and by performing binding assays to confirm the display of the desired peptides or proteins (Figure 2) [12].",

These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies.",

                    "text": "More the three decades ago, the seminal works by George Smith 35,36 and Greg Winter 6 gave birth to the phage display technology as a platform for peptide and antibody discovery. In the subsequent thirty plus years practicing phage display, it has been well established that the size and functionality of a library are critical parameters for success in isolating specific and high affinity antibodies from said library. Early selections from antibody phage-displayed libraries of 10 7 members generated ~90 nM antibody fragments to diverse proteins. 12 Further studies using larger libraries, e.g., >10 10 members, 8,13 produced antibody fragments with single-digit nM or sub-nM affinities. Similarly, a synthetic library called the Griffiths' library 9 of >10 10 members produced sub-nM binders, whereas antibody fragments of >100 nM were obtained when a small portion of the library containing only 10 7 clones was used in the selection process. \n\nIn parallel, as therapeutic antibody engineering and development evolved in the past decades, and dozens of antibodies were granted marketing approvals, it has been realized that reaching the desired specificity and affinity is not enough. 4,16 Other biological and biophysical properties such as expression, stability and solubility should be considered during the early discovery phase, so that the risks of failure in the late therapeutic development phase are minimized. This is particularly true for antibodies isolated using phage display, where the discovery process is performed in vitro, without the filters imposed in vivo. In such cases, the selected antibodies must be extensively scrutinized to ensure they meet the proper threshold of stability, solubility and low aggregation at the concentrations needed for therapeutic development. 17 e approached the design and construction of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 keeping these concepts in mind, i.e., generation of large and functional libraries with enhanced stability and low aggregation. We followed a three-step construction process that led to a progressive increase in functionality and stability, culminating in a valuable source of antibodies, as showed by panning the libraries using different strategies and an array of seven non-related targets. In all the cases specific antibodies were obtained. The best anti-HSA antibody and the two anti-TNF ones had a biophysical profile that meet the success criteria of antibody candidates amenable to further development.",

Almagro\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT We describe here the design, construction and validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122. These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies.\n## Discussion\nMore the three decades ago, the seminal works by George Smith 35,36 and Greg Winter 6 gave birth to the phage display technology as a platform for peptide and antibody discovery. In the subsequent thirty plus years practicing phage display, it has been well established that the size and functionality of a library are critical parameters for success in isolating specific and high affinity antibodies from said library. Early selections from antibody phage-displayed libraries of 10 7 members generated ~90 nM antibody fragments to diverse proteins. 12 Further studies using larger libraries, e.g., >10 10 members, 8,13 produced antibody fragments with single-digit nM or sub-nM affinities. Similarly, a synthetic library called the Griffiths' library 9 of >10 10 members produced sub-nM binders, whereas antibody fragments of >100 nM were obtained when a small portion of the library containing only 10 7 clones was used in the selection process. \n\nIn parallel, as therapeutic antibody engineering and development evolved in the past decades, and dozens of antibodies were granted marketing approvals, it has been realized that reaching the desired specificity and affinity is not enough. 4,16 Other biological and biophysical properties such as expression, stability and solubility should be considered during the early discovery phase, so that the risks of failure in the late therapeutic development phase are minimized. This is particularly true for antibodies isolated using phage display, where the discovery process is performed in vitro, without the filters imposed in vivo. In such cases, the selected antibodies must be extensively scrutinized to ensure they meet the proper threshold of stability, solubility and low aggregation at the concentrations needed for therapeutic development. 17 e approached the design and construction of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 keeping these concepts in mind, i.e., generation of large and functional libraries with enhanced stability and low aggregation. We followed a three-step construction process that led to a progressive increase in functionality and stability, culminating in a valuable source of antibodies, as showed by panning the libraries using different strategies and an array of seven non-related targets. In all the cases specific antibodies were obtained. The best anti-HSA antibody and the two anti-TNF ones had a biophysical profile that meet the success criteria of antibody candidates amenable to further development.",

Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.",

                    "text": "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance. This was further borne out by demonstrating proof of principle using delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) as antigen and isolating high affinity binders with neutralization of the DLL4-NOTCH1 interaction yielding IC 50 values below 10 nM (and equivalent to a benchmark antibody directed to DLL4). Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55]. \n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity. Many more examples of strategies applied to generate a robust phage display library for antibody discovery have been comprehensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,31] as well as the key attributes of historically important antibody libraries constructed for the identification of therapeutic antibodies [31]. \n\nDirect synthesis has enabled a much higher degree of precision and efficiency. Through solid-phase synthesis along with miniaturized chemistry, it is possible to synthesize oligonucleotides without randomization. Specifically, DNA synthesis can now be reliably performed on a large scale [57,58], such that millions of custom oligonucleotides can be synthesized as oligo pools on chip surfaces making the generation of large libraries of deliberately designed antibodies [59] that can be rapidly produced and screened in parallel. Significantly, such libraries need not be full-length antibodies as synthesis only needs to be restricted to antibody regions that contain CDR loops, such as VHH, scFv, and Fab antibody fragments. This approach opens the door to high-throughput screening opportunities. As with other synthesis methods, direct synthesis is not without its hurdles. Highly parallel direct oligonucleotide synthesis requires substantial infrastructure and automation.",

                    "text": "In the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression. These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function. \n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]. The initial library randomized only the VH CDR positions by binary code [53] and then diversity expanded incrementally to the VL CDR positions, as well as nonparatope residues that may impact on CDR conformation and structure. Improvements in affinity (to single digit nanomolar) were observed for the model soluble antigen used (VEGF) where the tyrosine side chains were sufficient to mediate the majority of antigen interactions. However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding.",

Hutchings, Aaron K. Sato\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Introduction Phage display technology is a well-established versatile in vitro display technology that has been used for over 35 years to identify peptides and antibodies for use as reagents and therapeutics, as well as exploring the diversity of alternative scaffolds as another option to conventional therapeutic antibody discovery. Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.\n## Article highlights\nIn the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression. These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function. \n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]. The initial library randomized only the VH CDR positions by binary code [53] and then diversity expanded incrementally to the VL CDR positions, as well as nonparatope residues that may impact on CDR conformation and structure. Improvements in affinity (to single digit nanomolar) were observed for the model soluble antigen used (VEGF) where the tyrosine side chains were sufficient to mediate the majority of antigen interactions. However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding.\n...\nIt was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance. This was further borne out by demonstrating proof of principle using delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) as antigen and isolating high affinity binders with neutralization of the DLL4-NOTCH1 interaction yielding IC 50 values below 10 nM (and equivalent to a benchmark antibody directed to DLL4). Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55]. \n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity. Many more examples of strategies applied to generate a robust phage display library for antibody discovery have been comprehensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,31] as well as the key attributes of historically important antibody libraries constructed for the identification of therapeutic antibodies [31]. \n\nDirect synthesis has enabled a much higher degree of precision and efficiency. Through solid-phase synthesis along with miniaturized chemistry, it is possible to synthesize oligonucleotides without randomization. Specifically, DNA synthesis can now be reliably performed on a large scale [57,58], such that millions of custom oligonucleotides can be synthesized as oligo pools on chip surfaces making the generation of large libraries of deliberately designed antibodies [59] that can be rapidly produced and screened in parallel. Significantly, such libraries need not be full-length antibodies as synthesis only needs to be restricted to antibody regions that contain CDR loops, such as VHH, scFv, and Fab antibody fragments. This approach opens the door to high-throughput screening opportunities. As with other synthesis methods, direct synthesis is not without its hurdles. Highly parallel direct oligonucleotide synthesis requires substantial infrastructure and automation.",

One of the determining factors for successful isolation of recombinant antibodies from libraries lies in the quality of the libraries i.e. the number of correctly folded, functional antibodies contained in the library. Here, we describe the construction of a novel, high quality, synthetic single domain antibody library dubbed Predator. The library is based on the HEL4 domain antibody with the addition of recently reported mutations concerning the amino acid composition at positions critical for the folding characteristics and aggregation propensities of domain antibodies. As a unique feature, the CDR3 of the library was designed to mimic the natural human immune response by designating amino acids known to be prevalent in functional antibodies to the diversity in CDR3. CDR randomizations were performed using trinucleotide synthesis to avoid the presence of stop codons. Furthermore a novel cycle free elongation method was used for the conversion of the synthesized single stranded DNA containing the randomized CDRs into double stranded DNA of the library. In addition a modular approach has been adopted for the scaffold in which each CDR region is flanked by unique restrictions sites, allowing easy affinity maturation of selected clones by CDR shuffling. To validate the quality of the library, one round phage display selections were performed on purified antigens and highly complex antigen mixtures such as cultured eukaryotic cells resulting in several specific binders. The further characterization of some of the selected clones, however, indicates a reduction in thermodynamic stability caused by the inclusion the additional mutations to the HEL4 scaffold.",

The diversity of the library was designed to reflect the amino acid composition of CDR regions from known functional human antibody clones, combined with additional knowledge of binding characteristics from specific amino acids.

Mandrup, Niels Anton Friis, S. Lykkemark, Jesper Just, P. Kristensen\n## Abstract\nToday a number of synthetic antibody libraries of different formats have been created and used for the selection of a large number of recombinant antibodies. One of the determining factors for successful isolation of recombinant antibodies from libraries lies in the quality of the libraries i.e. the number of correctly folded, functional antibodies contained in the library. Here, we describe the construction of a novel, high quality, synthetic single domain antibody library dubbed Predator. The library is based on the HEL4 domain antibody with the addition of recently reported mutations concerning the amino acid composition at positions critical for the folding characteristics and aggregation propensities of domain antibodies. As a unique feature, the CDR3 of the library was designed to mimic the natural human immune response by designating amino acids known to be prevalent in functional antibodies to the diversity in CDR3. CDR randomizations were performed using trinucleotide synthesis to avoid the presence of stop codons. Furthermore a novel cycle free elongation method was used for the conversion of the synthesized single stranded DNA containing the randomized CDRs into double stranded DNA of the library. In addition a modular approach has been adopted for the scaffold in which each CDR region is flanked by unique restrictions sites, allowing easy affinity maturation of selected clones by CDR shuffling. To validate the quality of the library, one round phage display selections were performed on purified antigens and highly complex antigen mixtures such as cultured eukaryotic cells resulting in several specific binders. The further characterization of some of the selected clones, however, indicates a reduction in thermodynamic stability caused by the inclusion the additional mutations to the HEL4 scaffold.\n## Introduction\nThere are two very important aspects of phage display selection of recombinant antibodies, namely the nature and quality of the material containing the antigen selected against, and perhaps more overlooked the quality and design of the displayed antibody library itself. Numerous phage display antibody libraries have been created over the years with many different specialized features, and the creation of new libraries continues as knowledge and technology expands [10,15,18,20,[24][25][26]. In this paper we report the construction of a novel domain antibody library with restricted randomizations at 4 and 7 positions in the CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. This was done by the use of trinucleotide synthesized oligonucleotides and an innovative PCR free annealing strategy designed to avoid clonal bias due to sequence and amplification of non-unique clones caused by the PCR cycling. The diversity of the library was designed to reflect the amino acid composition of CDR regions from known functional human antibody clones, combined with additional knowledge of binding characteristics from specific amino acids. The library was furthermore designed to be highly modular by including unique restriction sites surrounding all three CDRs, the leader peptide, and the tag region. The library was based on the aggregation resistant HEL4 domain antibody scaffold with the inclusion of a hydrophilic mutation at position 29 previously reported to improve solubility.",

                    "text": "Since the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

                    "text": "Ideally, the size of a library should be equal to its effective size, meaning that all the 10 11 antibody variants comprising the library are displayed as functional antibody molecules on the phage surface. Nonetheless, the quality of the gene synthesis, either using RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for na\u00efve libraries [9] or using chemical means for synthetic and semisynthetic libraries [29,38], affects the effective size of the libraries. Nucleotide sequences with stop codons leading to truncated sequences do not produce functional antibody fragments fused to a virion particle. Insertions or deletions of one or two nucleotides change the reading frame of the gene sequence generating truncated sequences, with stretches of amino acids that may impair folding or clones with solvent-exposed hydrophobic amino acids resulting in aggregation. Moreover, some in-frame antibody genes have low expression due to suboptimal codon usage in E. coli and/or inefficient translocation in the cell compartments [39]. These variants are displayed in low proportion with respect to other variants or are not displayed at all on the phage surface, which further erodes the effective size of the libraries. Furthermore, library synthesis methods based on mixtures of oligonucleotides or degenerated NNK codons might result in a reduction of diversity at the amino acid level due to the redundancy of the genetic code and/or encoded unwanted amino acids at targeted positions for diversification. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the percentage of open reading frames (ORFs) and percentage of antibody expression or display of the libraries listed in Table 1. It should be noted that some authors do not report the percentage of ORFs and/or display, whereas, others measured these parameters in diverse ways. For instance, Xoma [26] calculated the percentage of ORFs based on the number of complete sequences between the start of signal sequences through to the end of both the V L and V H for XFab1 and from the start of the signal sequence through to the end of the V L for XscFv2.",

                    "text": "In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.",

                    "text": "The method consists of building a library (left panel) of peptide or protein variants-or in the case of antibodies, an antibody gene repertoire-and affinity selecting (right panel) specific antibody-phage fusions via affinity with the target of interest. An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. Alternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16]. \n\nInitially, the main goal of phage display antibody discovery campaigns was to select for specific and high affinity antibodies [17]. In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials.",

                    "text": "While the library size can be defined by one number (N) and the effective size can be assessed by the percentage of antibody display, the diversity of a library has a somewhat elusive definition. Sometimes the size of an antibody repertoire is used as a proxy to characterize its diversity. However, it assumes that the antibody repertoire is a random set of antigen-binding site shapes and amino acid sidechains. Furthermore, not all antibody repertoires are created equal. \n\nFor instance, if one were to generate a library of antibody variants by diversifying all the 11 positions of the LCDR1 with the 20 amino acids, the resultant repertoire would be 20 11 or 2 \u00d7 10 14 antibody variants. This would appear to be a diverse repertoire based on its size and it would thus presumably lead to a large number of functional antibodies. Nevertheless, most of the amino acids in LCDR1 are located in the periphery of the antigen-binding site and have a marginal role in defining the binding properties of antibodies, especially for small and mid-sized targets [40]. Therefore, such a library would very likely be of limited use. In contrast, the same library size, e.g., 11 positions mutated to the 20 amino acids, but in the HCDR3, which is located at the center of the antigen-binding site and plays a critical role in recognizing diverse targets, would likely yield antibodies with reasonable affinity [41]. Hence, diversity is not only the number of in-frame and/or non-toxic antibody variants, but it is also the number of functional molecules capable of recognizing as many diverse targets as possible. \n\nThe first functional antibody repertoires used as a substrate to build phage display antibody libraries were obtained from immunized animals [42] or humans [43]. This type of library, known as immune, has been of limited application as general-purpose platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. Those obtained from immunized animals are single-use libraries as the libraries are biased toward the recognition of the antigen utilized as an immunogen. More importantly, the antibodies obtained from immune libraries, being nonhuman proteins, require further engineering (humanization), which increases the cost of the antibody drug development process.",

This technology was initially developed by George Smith in the mid-1980s and applied by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter to antibody engineering at the beginning of 1990s. Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges pertaining to phage display platforms and related display technologies.\n## Introduction\nThe method consists of building a library (left panel) of peptide or protein variants-or in the case of antibodies, an antibody gene repertoire-and affinity selecting (right panel) specific antibody-phage fusions via affinity with the target of interest. An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. Alternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16]. \n\nInitially, the main goal of phage display antibody discovery campaigns was to select for specific and high affinity antibodies [17]. In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials.\n...\nIn the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.\n\n## Effective Size of the Phage Display Antibody Libraries\nIdeally, the size of a library should be equal to its effective size, meaning that all the 10 11 antibody variants comprising the library are displayed as functional antibody molecules on the phage surface. Nonetheless, the quality of the gene synthesis, either using RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for na\u00efve libraries [9] or using chemical means for synthetic and semisynthetic libraries [29,38], affects the effective size of the libraries. Nucleotide sequences with stop codons leading to truncated sequences do not produce functional antibody fragments fused to a virion particle. Insertions or deletions of one or two nucleotides change the reading frame of the gene sequence generating truncated sequences, with stretches of amino acids that may impair folding or clones with solvent-exposed hydrophobic amino acids resulting in aggregation. Moreover, some in-frame antibody genes have low expression due to suboptimal codon usage in E. coli and/or inefficient translocation in the cell compartments [39]. These variants are displayed in low proportion with respect to other variants or are not displayed at all on the phage surface, which further erodes the effective size of the libraries. Furthermore, library synthesis methods based on mixtures of oligonucleotides or degenerated NNK codons might result in a reduction of diversity at the amino acid level due to the redundancy of the genetic code and/or encoded unwanted amino acids at targeted positions for diversification. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the percentage of open reading frames (ORFs) and percentage of antibody expression or display of the libraries listed in Table 1. It should be noted that some authors do not report the percentage of ORFs and/or display, whereas, others measured these parameters in diverse ways. For instance, Xoma [26] calculated the percentage of ORFs based on the number of complete sequences between the start of signal sequences through to the end of both the V L and V H for XFab1 and from the start of the signal sequence through to the end of the V L for XscFv2.\n\n## Types of Antibody Repertoires\nWhile the library size can be defined by one number (N) and the effective size can be assessed by the percentage of antibody display, the diversity of a library has a somewhat elusive definition. Sometimes the size of an antibody repertoire is used as a proxy to characterize its diversity. However, it assumes that the antibody repertoire is a random set of antigen-binding site shapes and amino acid sidechains. Furthermore, not all antibody repertoires are created equal. \n\nFor instance, if one were to generate a library of antibody variants by diversifying all the 11 positions of the LCDR1 with the 20 amino acids, the resultant repertoire would be 20 11 or 2 \u00d7 10 14 antibody variants. This would appear to be a diverse repertoire based on its size and it would thus presumably lead to a large number of functional antibodies. Nevertheless, most of the amino acids in LCDR1 are located in the periphery of the antigen-binding site and have a marginal role in defining the binding properties of antibodies, especially for small and mid-sized targets [40]. Therefore, such a library would very likely be of limited use. In contrast, the same library size, e.g., 11 positions mutated to the 20 amino acids, but in the HCDR3, which is located at the center of the antigen-binding site and plays a critical role in recognizing diverse targets, would likely yield antibodies with reasonable affinity [41]. Hence, diversity is not only the number of in-frame and/or non-toxic antibody variants, but it is also the number of functional molecules capable of recognizing as many diverse targets as possible. \n\nThe first functional antibody repertoires used as a substrate to build phage display antibody libraries were obtained from immunized animals [42] or humans [43]. This type of library, known as immune, has been of limited application as general-purpose platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. Those obtained from immunized animals are single-use libraries as the libraries are biased toward the recognition of the antigen utilized as an immunogen. More importantly, the antibodies obtained from immune libraries, being nonhuman proteins, require further engineering (humanization), which increases the cost of the antibody drug development process.\n\n## Concluding Remarks\nSince the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

The principle of in vivo recombination of the light and heavy chain gene of an antibody was first described by the group of Greg Winter as a means to increase library size [65]. A Cre/loxP two vector system was used, with a donor plasmid vector encoding the heavy chain and an acceptor fd phage vector encoding the light chain. Both heavy as well as light chain gene are flanked by loxP sites leading to a site-specific recombination in vivo. By-passing the limitation of transformation efficiency with infection, this system allows the generation of very large libraries. Griffiths and coworkers used this system to generate a phage display library of 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . Sblattero and Bradbury used a modified version where both the heavy and light chain V-genes were located on the same phagemid separated by a loxP site. Starting out with a relatively small initial library with a size of 7 \u00d7 10 7 they were able to generate a library of 3 \u00d7 10 11 in vivo by site-specific recombination [66]. Another important aspect is functional library size, which is limited by the occurrence of deletion mutants caused by frameshifts or stop codons introduced during diversification. Tremendous progress has been made by construction of vector systems comprising a positive selection for protein integrity.",

The principle of in vivo recombination of the light and heavy chain gene of an antibody was first described by the group of Greg Winter as a means to increase library size [65]. A Cre/loxP two vector system was used, with a donor plasmid vector encoding the heavy chain and an acceptor fd phage vector encoding the light chain. Both heavy as well as light chain gene are flanked by loxP sites leading to a site-specific recombination in vivo. By-passing the limitation of transformation efficiency with infection, this system allows the generation of very large libraries. Griffiths and coworkers used this system to generate a phage display library of 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . Sblattero and Bradbury used a modified version where both the heavy and light chain V-genes were located on the same phagemid separated by a loxP site. Starting out with a relatively small initial library with a size of 7 \u00d7 10 7 they were able to generate a library of 3 \u00d7 10 11 in vivo by site-specific recombination [66]. Another important aspect is functional library size, which is limited by the occurrence of deletion mutants caused by frameshifts or stop codons introduced during diversification. Tremendous progress has been made by construction of vector systems comprising a positive selection for protein integrity.",

Hwang, Ji Woong Kim, Ji Hyun Lee, Taehoon Ryu, Yushin Jung, Sukmook Lee\n## Abstract\nAntibody phage display is a key technology for the discovery and development of target-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for use in research, diagnostics, and therapy. The construction of a high-quality antibody library, with larger and more diverse antibody repertoires, is essential for the successful development of phage display-derived mAbs. In this study, a large human combinatorial single-chain variable fragment library (1.5 \u00d7 1011 colonies) was constructed from Epstein\u2013Barr virus-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with a combination of two of the activators of human B cells, the Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist R848 and interleukin-2. Next-generation sequencing analysis with approximately 1.9 \u00d7 106 and 2.7 \u00d7 106 full-length sequences of heavy chain variable (VH) and \u03ba light chain variable (V\u03ba) domains, respectively, revealed that the library consists of unique VH (approximately 94%) and V\u03ba (approximately 91%) sequences with greater diversity than germline sequences. Lastly, multiple unique mAbs with high affinity and broad cross-species reactivity could be isolated from the library against two therapeutically relevant target antigens, validating the library quality. These findings suggest that the novel antibody library we have developed may be useful for the rapid development of target-specific phage display-derived recombinant human mAbs for use in therapeutic and diagnostic applications.\n",

It details the mechanisms of action and applications of phages in treating MDR bacterial infections, particularly those associated with biofilms and intracellular pathogens. The review further highlights innovative uses of phages in vaccine development, cancer therapy, and as gene delivery vectors. Despite its targeted and efficient approach, phage therapy faces challenges related to phage stability, immune response, and regulatory approval.

By examining these areas in detail, this review underscores the immense potential and remaining hurdles in integrating phage-based therapies into modern medical practices.\n## Challenges and Future Directions\nDespite its success, challenges remain. Enhancing library diversity, refining affinity maturation, and addressing the complexity of disease targets are key areas for improvement. Solutions include creating more diverse phage libraries [267], optimizing selection methods [260], and integrating advanced screening techniques to target complex biological environments [262]. \n\nIn conclusion, phage display has become a cornerstone of drug discovery with its ability to identify and optimize therapeutic molecules.

Here, we describe the first of a three-step method to construct Antibody Libraries for Therapeutic Antibody Discovery (ALTHEA) Libraries. The three-step method involves (1) primary library (PL) construction, (2) filtered library construction, and (3) secondary library construction. The first step, described here, entails design, synthesis, and cloning of four PLs. These PLs are designed with specific properties amenable to therapeutic antibody development using one universal variable heavy (VH) scaffold and four distinct variable light (VL) scaffolds. The scaffolds are diversified in positions that bind both protein and peptide targets identified in antibody-antigen complexes of known structure using the amino acid frequencies found in those positions in known human antibody sequences, avoiding residues that may lead to developability liabilities. The diversified scaffolds are combined with 90 synthetic neutral HCDR3 sequences designed with developable human diversity genes (IGHD) and joining heavy genes (IGHJ) in germline configuration, and assembled as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) in a VL-linker-VH orientation. The four designed PLs are synthesized using trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIMs) and cloned independently into a phagemid vector for M13 pIII display. Quality control of the cloning of the four PLs is also described, which involves sequencing scFvs in each library.",

Pohl\n## Abstract\nDisplay of antibody fragments on the surface of M13 filamentous bacteriophages is a well-established approach for the identification of antibodies binding to a target of interest. Here, we describe the first of a three-step method to construct Antibody Libraries for Therapeutic Antibody Discovery (ALTHEA) Libraries. The three-step method involves (1) primary library (PL) construction, (2) filtered library construction, and (3) secondary library construction. The first step, described here, entails design, synthesis, and cloning of four PLs. These PLs are designed with specific properties amenable to therapeutic antibody development using one universal variable heavy (VH) scaffold and four distinct variable light (VL) scaffolds. The scaffolds are diversified in positions that bind both protein and peptide targets identified in antibody-antigen complexes of known structure using the amino acid frequencies found in those positions in known human antibody sequences, avoiding residues that may lead to developability liabilities. The diversified scaffolds are combined with 90 synthetic neutral HCDR3 sequences designed with developable human diversity genes (IGHD) and joining heavy genes (IGHJ) in germline configuration, and assembled as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) in a VL-linker-VH orientation. The four designed PLs are synthesized using trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIMs) and cloned independently into a phagemid vector for M13 pIII display. Quality control of the cloning of the four PLs is also described, which involves sequencing scFvs in each library.\n",

They provide small antibodies with very high stability, therefore potentially offering unique properties for diagnostic or even therapeutic applications.",

Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient [73,75,76]; however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified [72,77,78]. Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire [62,79]. Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens. \n\nAs was mentioned above, natural antibody libraries have a huge advantage over any sAB library since they contain only expressible and stable CDR variants that have passed multiple control points of the immune sys tem. In addition, chemical synthesis of CDRs is inher ently compromised by synthetic errors, introducing all sorts of mutations that generate unwanted amino acid substitutions and stop codons resulting in nonfunctional antibody clones [72,77] To eliminate poorly expressed clones and non productive frame shifts, a proofreading step, such as selection of ampicillin resistant sAB -\u03b2 lactamase genetic fusions, has been added as the final step of library construction [77].",

We designed and constructed phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries with enriched protein antigen-recognition propensities calculated with machine learning predictors, which indicated that the designed single-chain variable fragment variants were encoded with enhanced distributions of complementarity-determining region (CDR) hot spot residues with high protein antigen recognition propensities in comparison with those in the human antibody germline sequences. Antibodies derived directly from the synthetic antibody libraries, without affinity maturation cycles comparable to those in in vivo immune systems, bound to the corresponding protein antigen through diverse conformational or linear epitopes with specificity and affinity comparable to those of the affinity-matured antibodies from in vivo immune systems. The results indicated that more densely populated CDR hot spot residues were sustainable by the antibody structural frameworks and could be accompanied by enhanced functionalities in recognizing protein antigens. Our study results suggest that synthetic antibody libraries, which are not limited by the sequences found in antibodies in nature, could be designed with the guidance of the computational machine learning algorithms that are programmed to predict interaction propensities to molecules of diverse chemical properties, leading to antibodies with optimal characteristics pertinent to their medical applications.",

We used the computational methodology to assess antibody library designs to ensure that the antibody variants in the synthetic antibody libraries have substantial antibody-antigen interaction propensities, rather than just to imitate antibody sequences in nature or limit to the minimalist designs for antibody library constructions. The experimental tests of the functionalities of the antibody libraries indicated that these antibody library designs can be constructed and expressed with the phage display system, and the selected antibodies are functional both in stability, affinity and specificity to the target antigen comparable to the antibodies derived from natural immune systems.",

Jian, Hong-Sen Chen, Yi-Kai Chiu, Hung-Pin Peng, Chao-Ping Tung, I. Chen, Chung-Ming Yu, Yueh-Liang Tsou, W. Kuo, H. Hsu, A. Yang\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Antibodies provide immune protection by recognizing antigens of diverse chemical properties, but elucidating the amino acid sequence-function relationships underlying the specificity and affinity of antibody-antigen interactions remains challenging. We designed and constructed phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries with enriched protein antigen-recognition propensities calculated with machine learning predictors, which indicated that the designed single-chain variable fragment variants were encoded with enhanced distributions of complementarity-determining region (CDR) hot spot residues with high protein antigen recognition propensities in comparison with those in the human antibody germline sequences. Antibodies derived directly from the synthetic antibody libraries, without affinity maturation cycles comparable to those in in vivo immune systems, bound to the corresponding protein antigen through diverse conformational or linear epitopes with specificity and affinity comparable to those of the affinity-matured antibodies from in vivo immune systems. The results indicated that more densely populated CDR hot spot residues were sustainable by the antibody structural frameworks and could be accompanied by enhanced functionalities in recognizing protein antigens. Our study results suggest that synthetic antibody libraries, which are not limited by the sequences found in antibodies in nature, could be designed with the guidance of the computational machine learning algorithms that are programmed to predict interaction propensities to molecules of diverse chemical properties, leading to antibodies with optimal characteristics pertinent to their medical applications.\n## Discussion\nThe first HuCAL scFv library designs had a theoretical sequence space on the order of 10 18 (49 \u00d7 10 7 \u00d7 10 9 ). 44 Only around 10 10 HuCAL variants have been expressed as phage-displayed libraries, mainly due to the upper limit in the bacterial host transformation of the phage display technology settings. 44 The subsequent HuCAL GOLD technology incorporated knowledgebased designs to diversify all six CDRs in the antibody fragment variable domain, 43 and the HuCAL PLATINUM technology improved the 49 framework sequences based on the human antibody germline sequences. 45 The magnitudes of the library complexity remain on the order of 10 10 for all libraries of the HuCAL series. 45 ased on the notion that antibody paratopes are enriched with aromatic residues, noticeable upon solving the first structures of antibody-antigen complexes 11 and surveys of antibody structures and sequences thereafter, [12][13][14] the fundamental role of the tyrosyl side chains in antibodyantigen recognition has been demonstrated [46][47][48][49] with the functional antibodies selected and screened from the minimalist designs of antibody CDR libraries with only a small subset of amino acid types (Tyr, Ala, Asp, Ser) 49 or with binary code (Tyr and Ser). 48 Synthetic antibody libraries based on the observed distributions of amino acid type in antibodies have also been demonstrated to be productive tools in antibody discoveries. 50 he antibody libraries developed in this study are different from the previously developed synthetic antibody libraries in that our antibody libraries have been constructed with antibody-antigen (proteins and peptides) interaction propensity predictions as guidance. We used the computational methodology to assess antibody library designs to ensure that the antibody variants in the synthetic antibody libraries have substantial antibody-antigen interaction propensities, rather than just to imitate antibody sequences in nature or limit to the minimalist designs for antibody library constructions. The experimental tests of the functionalities of the antibody libraries indicated that these antibody library designs can be constructed and expressed with the phage display system, and the selected antibodies are functional both in stability, affinity and specificity to the target antigen comparable to the antibodies derived from natural immune systems.",

This method is based on the cloning of a specific, short nucleotide sequence (tag) in the phagemid coding for each phage-displayed antibody fragment (phage-Ab) present in a library. In order to set up and validate the method we identified about 10,000 different phage-Abs binding to receptors expressed in their native form on the cell surface (10 k Membranome collection) and tagged each individual phage-Ab. The frequency of each phage-Ab in a given population can at this point be inferred by measuring the frequency of its associated tag sequence through standard DNA hybridization methods. Using tiny amounts of biological samples we identified phage-Abs binding to receptors preferentially expressed on primary tumor cells rather than on cells obtained from matched normal tissues. These antibodies inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and tumor development in vivo, thus representing therapeutic lead candidates.",

Here we describe a strategy which enables the identification of antibodies that bind unknown receptors with a specific expression profile. The first key stage of this strategy is the selection of a relatively low-complexity, ''specialized'' library containing phage-Abs that bind to MPs (the Membranome collection). The second critical element is the development of a technology that enables an efficient differential screening of phage clones, using minimal amounts of biological samples. \n\nWe generated the Membranome collection by panning a phage-Ab library on cultured cells This process simultaneously selects ligands for several cell surface receptors. The complexity of the library, the display level of the target receptor on the cell surface and the affinity of the interaction between phage-Ab and the target receptor strongly affect this process. All these factors interact in a competitive environment where biological viability of the phage-Ab also plays a major role. Empirically, however, we observed that on average the number of new clones identified by panning on each different cell line remains relatively constant, indicating that we are still far from saturation of the library sequence diversity. \n\nThe amino acid sequence of VH3-CDR3, the hypervariable region which in most cases acts as a major binding determinant [6][7][8], is a unique and distinctive feature of each member of the repository. The Membranome phage-Ab collection hosts VH-CDR3 sequences ranging from 3 to 25 residues, with the frequency peaking around 10 residues, and analysis of the complete scFv region reveals a broad set of germline families. Together these two findings indicate that a wide variety of binding motifs are present in the collection. We estimate that the current version of the repository (10,000 clones) should target between 500 and 1,000 different antigens, corresponding to 10-20% of the complete Membranome.",

Cortese\n## Abstract\nA novel and efficient tagArray technology was developed that allows rapid identification of antibodies which bind to receptors with a specific expression profile, in the absence of biological information. This method is based on the cloning of a specific, short nucleotide sequence (tag) in the phagemid coding for each phage-displayed antibody fragment (phage-Ab) present in a library. In order to set up and validate the method we identified about 10,000 different phage-Abs binding to receptors expressed in their native form on the cell surface (10 k Membranome collection) and tagged each individual phage-Ab. The frequency of each phage-Ab in a given population can at this point be inferred by measuring the frequency of its associated tag sequence through standard DNA hybridization methods. Using tiny amounts of biological samples we identified phage-Abs binding to receptors preferentially expressed on primary tumor cells rather than on cells obtained from matched normal tissues. These antibodies inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and tumor development in vivo, thus representing therapeutic lead candidates.\n## DISCUSSION\nIn the majority of cases the identification of a therapeutic target necessarily precedes the selection of a therapeutic mAb, whereas we demonstrate that this ''therapeutic target to mAb'' approach can be reversed. Here we describe a strategy which enables the identification of antibodies that bind unknown receptors with a specific expression profile. The first key stage of this strategy is the selection of a relatively low-complexity, ''specialized'' library containing phage-Abs that bind to MPs (the Membranome collection). The second critical element is the development of a technology that enables an efficient differential screening of phage clones, using minimal amounts of biological samples. \n\nWe generated the Membranome collection by panning a phage-Ab library on cultured cells This process simultaneously selects ligands for several cell surface receptors. The complexity of the library, the display level of the target receptor on the cell surface and the affinity of the interaction between phage-Ab and the target receptor strongly affect this process. All these factors interact in a competitive environment where biological viability of the phage-Ab also plays a major role. Empirically, however, we observed that on average the number of new clones identified by panning on each different cell line remains relatively constant, indicating that we are still far from saturation of the library sequence diversity. \n\nThe amino acid sequence of VH3-CDR3, the hypervariable region which in most cases acts as a major binding determinant [6][7][8], is a unique and distinctive feature of each member of the repository. The Membranome phage-Ab collection hosts VH-CDR3 sequences ranging from 3 to 25 residues, with the frequency peaking around 10 residues, and analysis of the complete scFv region reveals a broad set of germline families. Together these two findings indicate that a wide variety of binding motifs are present in the collection. We estimate that the current version of the repository (10,000 clones) should target between 500 and 1,000 different antigens, corresponding to 10-20% of the complete Membranome.",

Biomarkers have been widely used for early detection, prediction of response after treatment, and for monitoring the progression of diseases. Antibodies represent promising tools for recognition of biomarkers, and are widely deployed as analytical tools in clinical settings. For immunodiagnostics, antibodies are now exploited as binders for antigens of interest across a range of platforms. More recently, the discovery of antibody surface display and combinatorial chemistry techniques has allowed the exploration of new binders from a range of animals, for instance variable domains of new antigen receptors (VNAR) from shark and variable heavy chain domains (VHH) or nanobodies from camelids. These single domain antibodies (sdAbs) have some advantages over conventional murine immunoglobulin owing to the lack of a light chain, making them the smallest natural biomarker binders thus far identified. In this review, we will discuss several biomarkers used as a means to validate diseases progress. The potential functionality of modern singe domain antigen binders derived from phylogenetically early animals as new biomarker detectors for current diagnostic and research platforms development will be described.",

                    "text": "Screening phage display libraries is a powerful tool for identifying specific binders from libraries that contain a large diversity of targets [33,208]. Library construction is achieved by splicing a repertoire of genes (genotype) that encodes the peptide into a gene that encodes a capsid structural protein (phenotype). The \"displayed\" peptides are included in the capsid layer on the phage surface. Ideally, these proteins should not interfere with the phage structure [209]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology has enabled phage library construction whereby billions of variant peptides and proteins are able to be presented on the surface of the phage [210,211]. From this diversity library, binders specific to proteins of interest with high affinity can be selected by biopanning. This technique facilitates understanding of protein-ligand interactions [212], antigen-antibody interactions [213,214], and permits improvement of the affinity of proteins to their binding partner [215,216]. For instance, phage display antibody libraries with diversities as high as 10 10 can be established using display technology [217,218]. Recently, surface display technology has expanded to include ribosome display [219], yeast surface display [220], and mammalian cell display [221]. Such technologies have enabled the exploration of new antibodies that may not otherwise have been discovered, from humans and animals including shark, camel, llama, and lamprey [222][223][224][225]. \n\nAntibody phage display libraries have been used extensively for isolation of high-affinity specific binders against unique antigens from different targets [226][227][228][229][230]. Three types of antibody libraries are typically constructed: na\u00efve, synthetic, and immunized libraries [231]. A na\u00efve antibody library refers to the repertoire of antibody genes derived from non-immunized donors. Synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using synthesized V-gene fragments with randomized CDRs, whereas immunized libraries are based on a host immunized with the target antigen of the disease [232]. The principle of the phage display is represented in Figure 2, indicating the workflows of library construction, biopanning, and clone screening prior to protein expression and purification for functional assays.",

Cheng, Candy Chuah, J. McCarthy\n## Abstract\nBiomarkers are defined as indicators of biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers have been widely used for early detection, prediction of response after treatment, and for monitoring the progression of diseases. Antibodies represent promising tools for recognition of biomarkers, and are widely deployed as analytical tools in clinical settings. For immunodiagnostics, antibodies are now exploited as binders for antigens of interest across a range of platforms. More recently, the discovery of antibody surface display and combinatorial chemistry techniques has allowed the exploration of new binders from a range of animals, for instance variable domains of new antigen receptors (VNAR) from shark and variable heavy chain domains (VHH) or nanobodies from camelids. These single domain antibodies (sdAbs) have some advantages over conventional murine immunoglobulin owing to the lack of a light chain, making them the smallest natural biomarker binders thus far identified. In this review, we will discuss several biomarkers used as a means to validate diseases progress. The potential functionality of modern singe domain antigen binders derived from phylogenetically early animals as new biomarker detectors for current diagnostic and research platforms development will be described.\n## Phage Display Technology for New Biomarker Binder Discovery\nScreening phage display libraries is a powerful tool for identifying specific binders from libraries that contain a large diversity of targets [33,208]. Library construction is achieved by splicing a repertoire of genes (genotype) that encodes the peptide into a gene that encodes a capsid structural protein (phenotype). The \"displayed\" peptides are included in the capsid layer on the phage surface. Ideally, these proteins should not interfere with the phage structure [209]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology has enabled phage library construction whereby billions of variant peptides and proteins are able to be presented on the surface of the phage [210,211]. From this diversity library, binders specific to proteins of interest with high affinity can be selected by biopanning. This technique facilitates understanding of protein-ligand interactions [212], antigen-antibody interactions [213,214], and permits improvement of the affinity of proteins to their binding partner [215,216]. For instance, phage display antibody libraries with diversities as high as 10 10 can be established using display technology [217,218]. Recently, surface display technology has expanded to include ribosome display [219], yeast surface display [220], and mammalian cell display [221]. Such technologies have enabled the exploration of new antibodies that may not otherwise have been discovered, from humans and animals including shark, camel, llama, and lamprey [222][223][224][225]. \n\nAntibody phage display libraries have been used extensively for isolation of high-affinity specific binders against unique antigens from different targets [226][227][228][229][230]. Three types of antibody libraries are typically constructed: na\u00efve, synthetic, and immunized libraries [231]. A na\u00efve antibody library refers to the repertoire of antibody genes derived from non-immunized donors. Synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using synthesized V-gene fragments with randomized CDRs, whereas immunized libraries are based on a host immunized with the target antigen of the disease [232]. The principle of the phage display is represented in Figure 2, indicating the workflows of library construction, biopanning, and clone screening prior to protein expression and purification for functional assays.",

However, nowadays, antibodies that can not only bind but can also alter the function of cell surface signaling components are increasingly sought after as therapeutic drugs. Therefore, the identification of such functional antibodies from a large antibody library is the subject of intensive research. New methods applied to combinatorial antibody libraries now allow the isolation of functional antibodies in the cellular environment. These selected agonist antibodies have provided new insights into important issues of signal transduction. Notably, when certain antibodies bind to a given receptor, the cell fate induced by them may be the same or different from that induced by natural agonists. In addition, combined with phenotypic screening, this platform allows us to discover unexpected experimental results and explore various phenomena in cell biology, such as those associated with stem cells and cancer cells.",

                    "text": "In general, combinatorial antibody libraries are constructed from mRNA or 2 of 11 RNA extracted from B cells of immunized or na\u00efve donors. Because the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) representing the immunoglobulin geneencoding repertoire are known, we can use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then specific primers to amplify different VH and VL gene families. These variable regions of antibody repertoires are then ligated to the phage display vector (phagemid), with the net result that the antibody is expressed on the surface of the phage and the gene encoding of the antibody is in the phage genome. The antibody-encoding gene is inserted into a phage coat protein gene causing the antibody fragment to be displayed on the outside of the phage, which results in a connection between genotype and phenotype. Once produced, the antibody library in the phage can be bound to an immobilized antigen. This allows us to use multiple binding and elution cycles for selection of antibodies with high affinity and specificity. Phage binders are screened by ELISA, then DNA sequences are analyzed and cloned into appropriate expression vectors to produce antibodies, or various antibody formats, for functional analysis (Figure 1). The antibody format in the phage display library can be a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or Fab fragments. Due to the small size and high solubility of phage particles (10 13 particles/mL), a library size of up to 10 11 independent clones can be effectively generated, and an extensive antibody diversity can be displayed in a single library. One advantage of combinatorial antibody library technology is the diversity of binders. Another advantage is the ability to directly generate human antibodies in vitro. Since many important therapeutic antibodies are antibodies to self-antigens, which is forbidden by tolerance, in vitro generation allows the by-passing of tolerance and the generation of antibodies to self-antigens such as cell surface proteins, or self-products such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1).",

Lerner\n## Abstract\nMost antibodies currently in use have been selected based on their binding affinity. However, nowadays, antibodies that can not only bind but can also alter the function of cell surface signaling components are increasingly sought after as therapeutic drugs. Therefore, the identification of such functional antibodies from a large antibody library is the subject of intensive research. New methods applied to combinatorial antibody libraries now allow the isolation of functional antibodies in the cellular environment. These selected agonist antibodies have provided new insights into important issues of signal transduction. Notably, when certain antibodies bind to a given receptor, the cell fate induced by them may be the same or different from that induced by natural agonists. In addition, combined with phenotypic screening, this platform allows us to discover unexpected experimental results and explore various phenomena in cell biology, such as those associated with stem cells and cancer cells.\n## Introduction\nIn general, combinatorial antibody libraries are constructed from mRNA or 2 of 11 RNA extracted from B cells of immunized or na\u00efve donors. Because the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) representing the immunoglobulin geneencoding repertoire are known, we can use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then specific primers to amplify different VH and VL gene families. These variable regions of antibody repertoires are then ligated to the phage display vector (phagemid), with the net result that the antibody is expressed on the surface of the phage and the gene encoding of the antibody is in the phage genome. The antibody-encoding gene is inserted into a phage coat protein gene causing the antibody fragment to be displayed on the outside of the phage, which results in a connection between genotype and phenotype. Once produced, the antibody library in the phage can be bound to an immobilized antigen. This allows us to use multiple binding and elution cycles for selection of antibodies with high affinity and specificity. Phage binders are screened by ELISA, then DNA sequences are analyzed and cloned into appropriate expression vectors to produce antibodies, or various antibody formats, for functional analysis (Figure 1). The antibody format in the phage display library can be a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or Fab fragments. Due to the small size and high solubility of phage particles (10 13 particles/mL), a library size of up to 10 11 independent clones can be effectively generated, and an extensive antibody diversity can be displayed in a single library. One advantage of combinatorial antibody library technology is the diversity of binders. Another advantage is the ability to directly generate human antibodies in vitro. Since many important therapeutic antibodies are antibodies to self-antigens, which is forbidden by tolerance, in vitro generation allows the by-passing of tolerance and the generation of antibodies to self-antigens such as cell surface proteins, or self-products such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1).",

Tsoumpeli, Alison Gray, Aimee L. Parsons, A. Spiliotopoulos, Jonathan P. Owen, K. Bishop, B. Maddison, K. Gough\n## Abstract\nPhage display technology utilises peptide and antibody libraries with very high diversities to select ligands with specific binding properties. The production of such libraries can be labour intensive and technically challenging and whilst there are commercial sources of libraries, the exploitation of the resulting binders is constrained by ownership of the libraries. Here, a peptide library of\u2009~\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 variants for display on gene VIII was produced alongside three VHH antibody libraries with similar diversity, where 12mer, 16mer or 21mer CDR3s were introduced into the highly stable cAbBCII10 scaffold displayed on gene III. The cloning strategy used a simple whole-plasmid PCR method and type IIS restriction enzyme assembly that facilitate the seamless insertion of diversity into any suitable phage coat protein or antibody scaffold. This method reproducibly produced 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 variants from just 10 transformations and the four libraries had relatively low bias with 82 to 86% of all sequences present as single copies. The functionality of both peptide and antibody libraries were demonstrated by selection of ligands with specific binding properties by biopanning. The peptide library was used to epitope map a monoclonal antibody. The VHH libraries were pooled and used to select an antibody to recombinant human collagen type 1.\n## Discussion\nthe different display formats exerting distinct selection criteria during bacterial propagation and/or variations in the efficacy or quality of the primers used in library construction.

Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets.\n",

            "text": "Phage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

            "text": "Over the past 15 years the generation of therapeutic antibodies from combinatorial antibody libraries has been established as a valid alternative to conventional immunization. To isolate candidates from such libraries the antibodies or antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of cells, phages, ribosomes or within the cell. Among those display methods, phage display has the longest history and it is among the technologies most commonly used today. While the choice of the antibody format can be limited by the display method, e.g., to the scFv or the Fab in the case of phage display, library design is in principle independent, as long as sufficient expression properties in the respective host system are ensured. \n\nCombinatorial antibody libraries differ in design, origin of sequence diversity and method of generation. All three aspects have an impact on the most essential features of a library: its size and functional diversity reflected in the ability to deliver high affinity antibodies with good biophysical properties. Antibody libraries can be classified into three major groups: na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. Most libraries aim at maximizing library diversity, but differ in their approaches of maximizing functional size and subsequent developability of the selected molecules. Limitation to a single stable framework or to a selected number of consensus frameworks to ensure good biophysical properties is one trend in this context. Currently there is a trend to be as close to human germline as possible, both in the choice of framework and CDR composition, to avoid potential issues of immunogenicity. \n\nWith the synthetic library of moderate size described by Pini and coworkers, scFvs were selected with monovalent affinities down to 10 nM [57]. Affinities achieved with large semi-synthetic libraries described by Hoet and S\u00f6derlind reached the sub-nanomolar range, whereas antibodies in the lower picomolar range have been isolated directly from the fully synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM \u00ae library as well as the very large na\u00efve CAT2.0 library. Affinity improvement factors vary widely within each method and are highly dependent on both the antigen as well as the starting molecule. The approaches targeting CDR regions have advantages concerning functional size of maturation libraries and integrity of antibody framework.",

These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of antibody fusion proteins and higher infectivity due to all wild type pIII molecules on phage particle, resulting in loss of library diversity. In efforts to increase functional library size, several strategies have been developed. For example, anti-tag antibody was used for proofreading panning to select in-frame sequences due to the tag being inframe with the antibody sequence. 177 In the design of the HuCAL GOLD library, the \u03b2-lactamase gene was used to eliminate frame-shifted sequences. 98 Regarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. 100 For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. 93,98 Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. 178 Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design. For the majority of the phage display libraries, V H and V L are randomly rearranged, which agrees with the observation that there is no obvious preference of V H /V L pairing in natural repertories. 179 However, in terms of drug development, since different V H /V L pairings do exhibit very distinct biophysical characteristics, 100,180 attention should be given to the choice of framework pairing.\n\nCompared to in vivo antibody discovery approaches, another advantage of phage display is that the sequence information can be retrieved rapidly and readily. However, this advantage is partially attenuated by the conventional screening approach of characterization of individual clones, in which only a small percentage of sequence information, i.e., the most abundant sequences, from",

            "text": "Phage display has become an efficient, reliable and popular molecular technique for generating libraries encompassing millions or even billions of clones of divergent peptides or proteins. The method is based on the correspondence between phage genotype and phenotype, which ensures the presentation of recombinant proteins of known amino acid composition on the surface of phage particles. The use of affinity selection allows one to choose variants with affinity for different targets from phage libraries. The implementation of the antibody phage display technique has revolutionized the field of clinical immunology, both for developing tools to diagnose infectious diseases and for producing therapeutic agents. It has also become the basis for efficient and relatively inexpensive methods for studying protein\u2013protein interactions, receptor binding sites, as well as epitope and mimotope identification. The antibody phage display technique involves a number of steps, and the final result depends on their successful implementation. The diversity, whether natural or obtained by combinatorial chemistry, is the basis of any library. The choice of molecular techniques is critical to ensure that this diversity is maintained during the phage library preparation step and during the transformation of E. coli cells. After a helper phage is added to the suspension of transformed E. coli cells, a bacteriophage library is formed, which is a working tool for performing the affinity selection procedure and searching for individual molecules. Despite the apparent simplicity of generating phage antibody libraries, a number of subtleties need to be taken into account. First, there are the features of phage vector preparation. Currently, a large number of phagemid vectors have been developed, and their selection is also of great importance. The key step is preparing competent E. coli cells and the technology of their transformation. The choice of a helper phage and the method used to generate it is also important. This article discusses the key challenges faced by researchers in constructing phage antibody libraries",

            "text": "More the three decades ago, the seminal works by George Smith 35,36 and Greg Winter 6 gave birth to the phage display technology as a platform for peptide and antibody discovery. In the subsequent thirty plus years practicing phage display, it has been well established that the size and functionality of a library are critical parameters for success in isolating specific and high affinity antibodies from said library. Early selections from antibody phage-displayed libraries of 10 7 members generated ~90 nM antibody fragments to diverse proteins. 12 Further studies using larger libraries, e.g., >10 10 members, 8,13 produced antibody fragments with single-digit nM or sub-nM affinities. Similarly, a synthetic library called the Griffiths' library 9 of >10 10 members produced sub-nM binders, whereas antibody fragments of >100 nM were obtained when a small portion of the library containing only 10 7 clones was used in the selection process. \n\nIn parallel, as therapeutic antibody engineering and development evolved in the past decades, and dozens of antibodies were granted marketing approvals, it has been realized that reaching the desired specificity and affinity is not enough. 4,16 Other biological and biophysical properties such as expression, stability and solubility should be considered during the early discovery phase, so that the risks of failure in the late therapeutic development phase are minimized. This is particularly true for antibodies isolated using phage display, where the discovery process is performed in vitro, without the filters imposed in vivo. In such cases, the selected antibodies must be extensively scrutinized to ensure they meet the proper threshold of stability, solubility and low aggregation at the concentrations needed for therapeutic development. 17 e approached the design and construction of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 keeping these concepts in mind, i.e., generation of large and functional libraries with enhanced stability and low aggregation. We followed a three-step construction process that led to a progressive increase in functionality and stability, culminating in a valuable source of antibodies, as showed by panning the libraries using different strategies and an array of seven non-related targets. In all the cases specific antibodies were obtained. The best anti-HSA antibody and the two anti-TNF ones had a biophysical profile that meet the success criteria of antibody candidates amenable to further development.",

            "text": "In the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression. These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function. \n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]. The initial library randomized only the VH CDR positions by binary code [53] and then diversity expanded incrementally to the VL CDR positions, as well as nonparatope residues that may impact on CDR conformation and structure. Improvements in affinity (to single digit nanomolar) were observed for the model soluble antigen used (VEGF) where the tyrosine side chains were sufficient to mediate the majority of antigen interactions. However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding.",

The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.",

            "text": "This is evidenced by the fact that only one study opted to employ the entire bacteriophage (T7 Select \u00ae ) (40), and only one utilized the Phagemid vector pJB12 in combination with the M13 K07DpIII hyperphage system for the multivalent display of VHHs (40). \n\nAlso, the selection of the display platform employed by different research groups plays a significant role in the phage display technique for antibody generation, as it can affect expression in phages, yeast, mammalian cells, or other platforms (23). This choice is intrinsically linked to the specific objectives of each group. Expression in bacteria is often an initial step, but if a suitable binder for an antigen cannot be identified, other expression systems may be explored. Systems such as yeast and mammalian cells prioritize post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and offer alternative antibody formats that may enhance affinity for the target. \n\nThe quality of the antibody library plays a pivotal role in determining the final quality of isolated antibodies throughout the selection process. There is a need for these antibodies to accurately mirror the immunological repertoire, demonstrating affinity and specificity for the desired target. One of the characteristics directly influencing the quality of the library is its size, as larger libraries increase the likelihood of obtaining antibodies capable of recognizing the target (42,44). Additionally, the diversity of the library also impacts the selection process, as it is responsible for generating a broad spectrum of antibodies capable of effectively binding to specific targets (44). Another relevant aspect to consider is the affinity of the antibodies obtained at the end of the campaign, a crucial feature in the development of molecules with therapeutic properties. This feature stands out when analyzing the library's quality, as a positive correlation has been observed between the affinity that the obtained antibodies can achieve and the size of the library. In other words, a larger library provides the potential to identify antibodies with higher affinity (42). It is worth noting that immune libraries generally have the ability to generate antibodies with superior affinities compared to Naive and artificially synthesized libraries, although there is less diversity, as the immune library has already been directed towards a specific target through the immunization process. In this scenario, the unique characteristics of Nbs make them excellent candidates for constructing antibody fragment libraries.",

            "text": "In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.",

            "text": "BackgroundAntibody phage display is a proven key technology that allows the generation of human antibodies for diagnostics and therapy. From naive antibody gene libraries - in theory - antibodies against any target can be selected. Here we describe the design, construction and characterization of an optimized antibody phage display library.ResultsThe naive antibody gene libraries HAL9 and HAL10, with a combined theoretical diversity of 1.5\u00d71010 independent clones, were constructed from 98 healthy donors using improved phage display vectors. In detail, most common phagemids employed for antibody phage display are using a combined His/Myc tag for detection and purification. We show that changing the tag order to Myc/His improved the production of soluble antibodies, but did not affect antibody phage display. For several published antibody libraries, the selected number of kappa scFvs were lower compared to lambda scFvs, probably due to a lower kappa scFv or Fab expression rate. Deletion of a phenylalanine at the end of the CL linker sequence in our new phagemid design increased scFv production rate and frequency of selected kappa antibodies significantly. The HAL libraries and 834 antibodies selected against 121 targets were analyzed regarding the used germline V-genes, used V-gene combinations and CDR-H3/-L3 length and composition. The amino acid diversity and distribution in the CDR-H3 of the initial library was retrieved in the CDR-H3 of selected antibodies showing that all CDR-H3 amino acids occurring in the human antibody repertoire can be functionally used and is not biased by E. coli expression or phage selection. Further, the data underline the importance of CDR length variations.ConclusionThe highly diverse universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 were constructed using an optimized scFv phagemid vector design. Analysis of selected antibodies revealed that the complete amino acid diversity in the CDR-H3 was also found in selected scFvs showing the functionality of the naive CDR-H3 diversity.",

            "text": "Antibody discovery by phage display consists of two phases, i.e., the binding phase and the amplification phase. Ideally, the selection process is dominated by the former, and all the retrieved clones are amplified equally during the latter. In reality, the amplification efficiency of antibody fragments varies widely among different sequences and, after a few rounds of phage display panning, the output repertoire often includes rapidly amplified sequences with low or no binding activity, significantly diminishing the efficiency of antibody isolation. In this work, a novel synthetic single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library with complementarity-determining region (CDR) diversities aimed at improved amplification efficiency was designed and constructed. A previously reported synthetic scFv library with low, non-combinatorial CDR diversities was panned against protein A superantigen, and the library repertoires before and after the panning were analyzed by next generation sequencing. The enrichment or depletion patterns of CDR sequences after panning served as the basis for the design of the new library. Especially for CDR-H3 with a higher and more random diversity, a machine learning method was applied to predict potential fast-amplified sequences among a simulated sequence repertoire. In a direct comparison with the previous generation library, the new library performed better against a panel of antigens in terms of the number of binders isolated, the number of unique sequences, and/or the speed of binder enrichment. Our results suggest that the amplification-centric design of sequence diversity is a valid strategy for the construction of highly functional phage display antibody libraries.",

            "text": "Since the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

            "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

            "text": "Phage display technology was developed by George Smith in 1985 (Smith, 1985) to display peptides on the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. In an effort to isolate \"fully human\" antibodies and thus bypass humanization, phage display was adapted at the beginning of 1990s (McCafferty et al., 1990) to display antibody V-domain repertoires and to isolate antibodies of interest in vitro. During the 1990s and the last decade, several academic laboratories and biotechnology companies have designed and implemented human antibody phage-displayed libraries for antibody discovery (Hoogenboom, 2005;Bradbury, 2010). Such libraries have enabled the isolation of high affinity and specific antibodies against a wide range of molecules and the antibody library design and implementation process continues to evolve. \n\nSince phage display bypasses immunization, it is especially useful for obtaining antibodies against targets that are highly conserved across species and those that may be toxic, where in vivo methods are ineffective and/or impractical. In addition, since phage display technology allows access to the repertoire of genes intended for expression and display on the phage surface, the number of genes and variants can be designed or chosen to bias the repertoire toward genes with predefined characteristics, opening up the possibility of testing hypotheses on how the size of a repertoire, its diversity and composition impact the selection of specific, stable, soluble, and high affinity antibodies. Overviews of different man-made repertoires and how their performance has enhanced our knowledge of the evolution of the antibody repertoire are provided below.",

In this study, an identical antibody repertoire was displayed as Fab fragments on p9, p3 and truncated p3 (p3\u0394). In addition, the library clones were displayed as ScFv fragments on p3\u0394 and the Fab-p3 display valency was modulated by hyperphage and VCS-M13 superinfections. The selection performances of the libraries were followed in repeated parallel panning reactions against streptavidin (STR) and digoxigenin (DIG). Selection was successful with all display formats, but the enrichment of specific clones from Fab-p9 library was clearly less efficient than from the other libraries. The most diverse outputs were obtained from p3\u0394 display and the highest affinity anti-DIG antibodies from the ScFv repertoire. Unfortunately, the number of retrieved specific clones was too low for explicit analysis of the differences in the number of obtained unique clones from each library. However, severe reduction in sequence diversity was observed in p3-Fab libraries prior to panning, which in turn, materialized as a low number of unique specific clones. Oligovalent display by hyperphage resulted in a higher number of unique clones, but the same highest affinity anti-DIG Fab was recovered also by VCS-M13 superinfection. The compromised enrichment of the target-specific clones from the Fab repertoire as a fusion to p9 capsid protein in our experiments, the significant loss of functional diversity in Fab-p3 library after single phage packing cycle and the retrieval of higher affinity anti-digoxigenin clones as ScFv molecules than as Fab molecules from the same source repertoire indicate that the chosen display format may have a significant impact on the selection outcome.

            "text": "they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of immune phage display libraries for the identification of functional and diverse scFv fragments. As 5% of the immunoglobulin repertoire in rodents expresses the lambda light chain, we have considered the kappa chain locus only. 31 We analyzed data from two immune libraries against CD160 and CD123 based on HCDR3 abundance within the enriched libraries, and selected clones either based on frequency or phylogenetic distance to allow the isolation of more diverse binders. An interesting observation was that not all clones enriched by phage display panning bound to target antigen, but we observed a success rate of 75% and 81% when we analyzed the most frequent clones prevalent after CD160 and CD123 selection, respectively. This strategy consists of conventional phage display biopanning followed by SMRT sequencing and open source NGS analysis to identify an expansive repertoire of antigen-specific antibody clones, with virtually no screening required. A disadvantage of the system deployed here, relative to second-generation systems such as the Illumina platform, is the far lower sequencing depth obtained. Typically yields of 80,000 reads for a 1 Kb sequence fragment can be generated, as compared to over 5 \u00d7 10 6 reads for Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Clearly, the read depths obtained in our experiments were insufficient to cover the theoretical diversity of a typical phage display library. It is possible to modify the sequencing protocol by sequencing the same prepared library on multiple SMRT cells of the sequencer. As library preparation and instrument run time are a substantial proportion of the sequencing cost, this approach could enable sequencing depth to be increased 10-fold with a modest increase in sequencing costs. For the purpose of this study and using an approach in which libraries are first enriched against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have",

Ohara and colleagues compared the properties of recombinant Fabs from a library of synthetically diversified human antibodies with polyclonal antisera against the same targets and reported that the Fabs were well-suited to Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (69). Earlier, de Wildt et al. described experiments in which one or two rounds of conventional screening were used to isolate phage from synthetically diversified libraries constructed on single V H and V L frameworks. Clones (up to 12,000) were then picked and gridded out using robotics onto membranes coated with the targets to test their specificity (56). The study demonstrated the capacity of large display libraries to yield antibodies against a wide range of targets and the ability to extract antibodies against minor components of complex mixtures, given appropriate (robotic) methods for identification of the recognition of target. Other investigators have described phage selection using blots prepared from 2-dimensional gels -a use of the proteome itself as the target for extraction of specific antibodies from a library. \n\nFor na\u00efve or synthetically diversified libraries, the diversity of the resource is such that extraction of antibodies against human protein targets (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (2), human chorionic gonadotropin (28)), molecules that are highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and therefore poorly immunogenic (e.g., ubiquitin (56)) or toxic compounds (e.g., doxorubicin (5)) is possible. \n\nAntibodies isolated through phage display can be developed as diagnostic reagents but a more intriguing prospect is their use in construction of microarrays upon which binding of multiple analytes could be detected (40). Phage display is particularly valuable in this area of application because a single, highly diversified resource (the library) can be conveniently mined for antibodies against very many different targets. Some authors have described the use of stringent selection methods to isolate antibodies of very high affinity via phage display (70).",

Based on the fusion of antibody fragments to M13 filamentous bacteriophage envelope proteins (17), phage display libraries can generate tremendous diversity of antibody fragments on the phage surface (18,19). With standard panning methodologies, up to hundreds of phage binders can be isolated. Phage display antibody libraries have proven to be a powerful and efficient tool to isolate diagnostic or potential therapeutic antibodies (18). \n\nThere are many types of phage display libraries such as natural, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic; and they are classified by the source of their sequences (19). A natural library can be obtained from various human B-cells and are relatively similar to the natural human antibody repertoire. Immune libraries are constructed from infection-recovered humans or immunized animals and can yield high affinity binders against targets from a small sized immune library (~10 6 ). The diversity of a semi-synthetic library is increased through mutating one or more CDRs by using oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis or mixing synthetic and natural sequences (18,19). A synthetic library is composed of artificially designed and synthesized antibody sequences (20,21). Engineered semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries have several advantages including the use of scaffolds with highly stable properties and codon-optimized sequences with high expression levels (21, 22). Generally, immune libraries are directed towards limited number of targets. Natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic libraries can be used to isolate high affinity binders against broad antigens but are required to have very high diversity (~10 10 to 10 11 ). \n\nThe size and quality of diversity design and functional clones of the antibody library are crucial for the success of isolating potential therapeutic antibodies (20)(21)(22).",

            "text": "Aiming for the library size \u226410 10 unique CDR combinations can significantly improve the clone coverage and sampling power of the phage display. \n\nAs was stated above, theoretical size of the library depends on its design: the number of CDRs touched, the length range of the CDR loops and quality, and quantity of the codon randomization events in each CDR. Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient [73,75,76]; however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified [72,77,78]. Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire [62,79]. Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens. \n\nAs was mentioned above, natural antibody libraries have a huge advantage over any sAB library since they contain only expressible and stable CDR variants that have passed multiple control points of the immune sys tem. In addition, chemical synthesis of CDRs is inher ently compromised by synthetic errors, introducing all sorts of mutations that generate unwanted amino acid substitutions and stop codons resulting in nonfunctional antibody clones [72,77] To eliminate poorly expressed clones and non productive frame shifts, a proofreading step, such as selection of ampicillin resistant sAB -\u03b2 lactamase genetic fusions, has been added as the final step of library construction [77].",

            "text": "against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have been performed or where a broader view of an immune repertoire is desired, the depth of sequencing may become limiting.\n\nIncreasingly, antibody discovery has become a high throughput empiric endeavor. Antibodies with desired properties, such as receptor agonism or the appropriate binding kinetics, within a population may be rare. Thus, it is often necessary to sample highly diverse populations in order to obtain the antibody of interest. Our library sequencing approach allows the isolation of large numbers of antibodies that have been affinity matured in-vivo and are thus likely to retain excellent specificity and biophysical properties. 32 Single cell screening technologies such as SLAM 33 and microfluidic-based 34 platforms similarly offer an excellent source of in-vivo matured antibodies, but themselves suffer limitations. In B cell binding strategies, screening of the antibody repertoire often requires live cells to be manipulated and sorted for antigen binding, limiting the antibody repertoire to memory B cells that express surface IgG. Microfluidic-based platforms allow the real-time interrogation of plasma cells that secrete IgG, but these technologies are technically complex and require specialized instrumentation. The strategy that we describe is relatively low cost, simple and easily adoptable by most labs while offering a depth and diversity of antigen specific antibodies similar to single cell methods. Single B cell methods have a clear advantage in the native pairing of heavy and light chains, but they are limited to a small numbers of antigen-specific B cell that can be efficiently sorted and recovered before the sequence identification. 15,35 Here we have described a simple method using SMRT sequencing to interrogate diversity from enriched phage display libraries to identify antigen-specific scFvs. The interrogation of the full-length sequences of each clone provides the advantageous information of functionally paired VH-VL selected during the phage display biopanning rounds. A logical next step for this technology will be to incorporate techniques such as single cell emulsion PCR 36 at the library generation stage. Combining these methods will enable the generation and full screening of natively paired heavy and light",

            "text": "Consequently, a majority of the antibodies developed today are owned by these companies with proprietary access to the underlying technologies. While many patents have expired in Europe and the United States, there is a notable opportunity for academic groups or startups to create their libraries and contribute to the development of antibodies as translational products. Encouragingly, some companies, such as Bio-Rad, now provide cost-effective antibody discovery services. Conversely, some phage display antibody libraries established prior to 2010 remain accessible to academic laboratories, notably at The University of Cambridge and the Scottish Biologics Facility. Of note among these libraries are Tomlinson's libraries, which have yielded high-affinity antibodies for numerous targets [92,93]. \n\nAntibody engineering through phage-display technology is a powerful but intricate process, facing several challenges that researchers have actively addressed to enhance its efficacy. One significant difficulty lies in achieving optimal binding affinities and specificities. The diverse and complex nature of target antigens often necessitates the meticulous optimization of phage display conditions to isolate antibodies with the desired properties. This involves multiple rounds of selection, sometimes requiring extensive screening and affinity maturation to enhance the binding capabilities of the displayed antibodies. Meanwhile, the issue of immunogenicity poses another obstacle in antibody engineering [13]. Antibodies derived from non-human sources, like murine antibodies, may trigger an immune response in humans. Humanization techniques, involving the grafting of CDRs onto human frameworks, have been developed to mitigate this challenge and create antibodies with reduced immunogenic potential [94]. Additionally, achieving functional antibodies with diverse isotypes and formats adds complexity to the engineering process. Scientists have explored different display formats, such as scFvs or Fab fragments, to optimize the selection of antibodies based on their intended applications [23]. Advancements in screening and selection methodologies have significantly improved the efficiency and throughput of antibody discovery using phage display. Techniques such as high-throughput screening, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and next-generation sequencing allow for the rapid identification and characterization of antibodies with desired binding specificities and functional properties. Moreover, advances in library construction, selection methodologies, and molecular design have significantly improved the efficiency of isolating antibodies with high affinity, specificity, and reduced immunogenicity.",

            "text": "expression and antigen binding. Grafting CDRs into a germline or consensus framework, can leave behind the co-selected framework variants contributing to antibody stability and expression. Similarly during phage display or other in vitro selection methods, CDR-libraries may not be compatible with a standard framework, leading to antibody instability and aggregation 40 . Moreover, antibodies that display these poor in vitro characteristics can be lost during the selection process due to poor expression, decreasing the effective library size and excluding potential high-affinity binders. Here, we show that the use of framework libraries derived from naturally occurring somatic mutations can rescue antibody stability that is lost during the therapeutic discovery process. In addition to providing solutions to move antibodies into clinical development, it may be advantageous to include this framework diversity in the library design, allowing sampling of the full library diversity as well as selection of antibodies with improved in vitro properties. Now that we have simplified the bacterial display process, it makes it an attractive tool for use in many applications. In the antibody community, it could be used with larger libraries for Fc-engineering, antibody discovery, or affinity maturation. The limitations of library size while screening with FACS could be overcome by using a pre-enriched phage library 41 . Beyond antibodies, our BAD system could be applicable as a general high throughput tool to study protein export, folding, or localization in the E. coli periplasm, as it offers a true readout in a cellular host environment. A major strength of our system is the non-tethered approach that now allows use of the native protein format, making fusion partners, reporter proteins, or membrane tethers unnecessary 42,43 . Furthermore, our live cell setting approach now enables the rapidly evolving field of genomic engineering to screen for desired host characteristics, something that was unattainable with previous display technologies.",

Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies.

An antibody library, a large collection of diverse, pre-constructed antibodies, can be rapidly screened using in vitro display technologies such as phage display. One of the keys to successful in vitro antibody discovery is the quality of the library diversity. Antibody diversity can be obtained either from natural B-cell sources or by the synthetic methods that combinatorially generate random nucleotide sequences. While the functionality of a natural antibody library depends largely upon the library size, various other factors can affect the quality of a synthetic antibody library, making the design and construction of synthetic antibody libraries complicated and challenging. In this review, we present various library designs and diversification methods for synthetic antibody library. From simple degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis to trinucleotide synthesis to physicochemically optimized library design, the synthetic approach is evolving beyond the simple emulation of natural antibodies, into a highly sophisticated method that is capable of producing high quality antibodies suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic, and other demanding applications.

            "text": "This review has considered the phage display of Fabs, scFvs and nanobodies. With potential application to all recombinant antibody library types are the recent improvement in library design and display efficiency. The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage [52]. Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions [49]. Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases [34,36] as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences [25] can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments [31,32,50,66]. The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy. They should also produce more useful reagents. \n\nMethods suitable for the batch reformatting of both Fabs and scFvs into IgGs for high-level expression in mammalian cell culture are now also described [26,27,58,59]. These will facilitate the efficient cloning of sub-libraries of antibody fragments from panning experiments to allow them to be screened as IgGs. This has previously been a bottleneck in developing therapeutics from phage display libraries, as the monovalent recombinant antibody fragments often have very different properties to their concomitant divalent IgGs. \n\nNanobodies from both camelids and sharks are readily amenable to the production of simple, high diversity phage display libraries [18,19]. They provide small antibodies with very high stability, therefore potentially offering unique properties for diagnostic or even therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "Phage display technology has been widely used for antibody affinity maturation for decades. The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions. Potent candidates were identified according to their high frequencies using NGS analysis, by-passing the need for the primary screening of target-binding clones. Furthermore, a subsequent library by recombination of the 10 most abundant variants from four CDRs was constructed and screened, and a mutant with 158-fold increased affinity (Kd = 25.5 pM) was obtained. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology for optimizing the binding properties of other antibodies and biomolecules.",

            "text": "Screening phage display libraries is a powerful tool for identifying specific binders from libraries that contain a large diversity of targets [33,208]. Library construction is achieved by splicing a repertoire of genes (genotype) that encodes the peptide into a gene that encodes a capsid structural protein (phenotype). The \"displayed\" peptides are included in the capsid layer on the phage surface. Ideally, these proteins should not interfere with the phage structure [209]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology has enabled phage library construction whereby billions of variant peptides and proteins are able to be presented on the surface of the phage [210,211]. From this diversity library, binders specific to proteins of interest with high affinity can be selected by biopanning. This technique facilitates understanding of protein-ligand interactions [212], antigen-antibody interactions [213,214], and permits improvement of the affinity of proteins to their binding partner [215,216]. For instance, phage display antibody libraries with diversities as high as 10 10 can be established using display technology [217,218]. Recently, surface display technology has expanded to include ribosome display [219], yeast surface display [220], and mammalian cell display [221]. Such technologies have enabled the exploration of new antibodies that may not otherwise have been discovered, from humans and animals including shark, camel, llama, and lamprey [222][223][224][225]. \n\nAntibody phage display libraries have been used extensively for isolation of high-affinity specific binders against unique antigens from different targets [226][227][228][229][230]. Three types of antibody libraries are typically constructed: na\u00efve, synthetic, and immunized libraries [231]. A na\u00efve antibody library refers to the repertoire of antibody genes derived from non-immunized donors. Synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using synthesized V-gene fragments with randomized CDRs, whereas immunized libraries are based on a host immunized with the target antigen of the disease [232]. The principle of the phage display is represented in Figure 2, indicating the workflows of library construction, biopanning, and clone screening prior to protein expression and purification for functional assays.",

This repertoire design was highly effective in generating nM-affinity clones with specificity for a selection of proteins and peptides (Knappik et al., 2000;Marget et al., 2000). \n\nThe methods used by Knappik et al. (2000) have since been elaborated upon in a number of reports. Rothe et al. (2008), reported the construction of the next-generation library HuCal Gold\u2122 in which the design strategy was refined to change the CDR design complexity, the structural format of the library (to Fab fragment) and also to move to \"CysDisplay\" in which the expressed antibody is tethered to the phage via a disulphide bond with a mutant p3 protein. In this library, the CDR diversity was extended to the CDRs 1 and 2 of both V-domains, in addition to the CDR3s. The CDR cassettes were again based on trinucleotide technology and were built to accurately reflect the canonical structures and diversity found in the families upon which each of the consensus frameworks were built, consciously including structures known to be preferred in the recognition of peptides. The finalized library was found to be of very high practical utility, routinely generating antibody specificities and affinities in the single digit nM range that were useful for both therapeutic and reagent purposes (Jarutat et al., 2006(Jarutat et al., , 2007;;Ohara et al., 2006;Prassler et al., 2009). This library design had, however, made a critical concession to optimize its function in E. coli expression and phage display technology: the FRs were codon optimized specifically to maximize for E. coli periplasmic expression rate. In addition, this function had been aggressively selected for by pre-screening all antibody sequences for periplasmic transport as \u03b2-lactamase fusions before inclusion in the final library.",

There are two main approaches to library design: creation of (1) a highly diverse library potentially containing binders to varied targets or (2) a library focused on potential binders to a specific antigen or set of antigens. The ideal library contains genetically varied antibodies with the potential for high affinity and activity, but this can result in the generation of increasingly large libraries to achieve  high diversity. With the huge amount of available sequence data and increased understanding of developability prediction, methods are being investigated for the optimal design of antibody libraries with high functionality and desired biophysical properties.",

            "text": "Phage display has become the most frequently used display technology, with the advantage of robustness due to high stability of the phage (Hoet et al., 2005). The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human mAbs against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

            "text": "The immune libraries are obtained from immunized animals or humans and are mostly used to discover antibodies against infectious pathogens (Trott et al., 2014) or antigenic targets in cancer patients (Thie et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2016). This library contains a restricted antibody repertoire that underwent antigen-driven in vivo selection (Barbas et al., 1991;Orum et al., 1993;Frenzel et al., 2016), which differs from the other phage display libraries, known as \"universal\", that theoretically provide binders for all possible antigen structures (Frenzel et al., 2016). The na\u00efve antibody libraries are generated from a pool of B lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, and one successful example is the scFv library licensed from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT; now part of MedImmune/AstraZeneca) (Javle et al., 2014;Almagro et al., 2019). While the na\u00efve libraries are derived from natural antibody gene repertoires, the synthetic ones are entirely based on in silico design to obtain individual antibody amino acid sequences (Fuh, 2007), bypassing the need to isolate antibody genes. The semisynthetic libraries, on the other hand, are created using both naturally and synthetically (in silico) randomized CDRs. In this library type, it is possible to redesign natural CDRs to improve the chance of finding antibodies with high specificity and affinity (Orum et al., 1993;Fuh, 2007). \n\nBuilding the phage display library is the most important step of this technology. There is a directly proportional relationship between the size of the antibody library and the probability of finding a particular antibody (Burioni et al., 1997;Almagro et al., 2019). The Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an important tool to analyze the variability, the sequence composition, and the size of antibody phage display libraries (Rouet et al., 2018). The construction of a phage display library is more expensive than generating hybridomas after animal immunization. However, the antibody screening step of the phage display method is faster and cheaper (Hentrich et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In addition, the phage display can simplify the cloning process and acquire a large amount of material to produce peptides or proteins because of the small size of the phage genome and high efficiency of the phage infection (67,68). \n\nThe phage display offers the direct physical link between a protein and its genetic material, which helps people to effectively screen the desired cloning again and again, and then amplify it (67). In the process of library screening, specific phage clones are enriched continuously due to their specific affinity for ligands, and relatively rare clones that can bind ligands can be quickly and effectively screened out from a large library (58). Therefore, the biggest advantage of phage display is that once the phage library is established, specific antibodies against the target antigen can be directly screened from the library according to the needs within 23 weeks, which greatly reduces the preparation cycle of mAbs (61). In addition, by specific construction, the filamentous phage may act as a vector, and generate a peptide library of phage display that contains hundreds of millions of unique peptides, which are conducive to their application in antiviral research (69). However, due to the different binding properties of antibodies in bacteria and eukaryotic cells, the applicability of the technology is limited to a certain extent (70). The processes of the phage display refer to bacterial transformation, phage packaging, and even transmembrane secretion processes, which limit the capacity of the phage display library and their molecular diversity. At present, the capacity of the phage display library is usually 10 11 (27). Also, limited by the expression system, the antibody library is not large enough to support the acquisition of some rare antibodies and not all sequences are well expressed in phages, because the realisation of some protein functions acquire folding, transportation, membrane insertion and complexation, resulting in the need for additional selection pressure during in vivo screening (45). It is difficult to obtain antibodies that inhibit the growth or function of phages or the expression host, as the phage display system depends on the expression of intracellular genes, which may make the diversity of the library decrease rapidly (71).",

            "text": "We were able to display the same Fab library as a fusion to all tested capsid proteins of filamentous phage. There was a decrease in display efficiency of the Fab molecules with a sequence: hyperphage-packed Fab-p3 > VCS-M13packed Fab-p3\u0394 > VCS-M13-packed Fab-p3 > VCS-M13-packed Fab-p9. The poor display of Fab on p9 was reflected as markedly slower enrichment of binding clones or even as a failed experiment in the applied selection conditions. Selecting for more than three rounds is therefore recommended with a similar construction as Fab-p9 as exemplified by the last panning experiment with p9, in which specific Fab clones were obtained only after four rounds of selection. There was a significant loss of functional diversity in Fab-p3 library after a single pass of phage packing, irrespective of the helper phage used. The enrichment of frameshift mutants was also observed with ScFv-p3\u0394, but to a lesser extent. The loss of functional diversity in phage packed Fab-p3 library was further evidenced by the low number of retrieved unique specific Fab clones, especially from VCS-M13-superinfected selections. As highlighted by these observations, a better overview of the true functional diversity of a library is obtained by sequencing the library after phage packing. Currently, even the most precisely analysed antibody repertoires have been sequenced before phage packing [34,35], which is not the same as the actual repertoire used for the selections, which could be analysed post phage packing.\n\nThe oligovalently displayed Fab-p3 library retained more different clones through the selections than the monovalent display (8 vs. 4 unique clones for STR and DIG), although the purely oligovalent or hyper > VCS-strategy could not provide any higher affinity clone than was already obtained by purely monovalent display. Overall, the highest numbers of unique specific clones were obtained with Fab-and ScFv-p3\u0394 display and, the highest affinity anti-digoxigenin antibody fragments in this study were obtained from the ScFv-repertoire with IC50 values 112 \u00b1 24",

            "text": "Phage display libraries included natural antibody libraries, semi-synthetic antibody libraries, and synthetic antibody libraries. Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002;Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams & Sidhu, 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015). \n\nThe capacity of fully synthetic antibody libraries was theoretically the largest, but there were key issues that need to be addressed, such as conserved sequencing of backbone regions (Benhar, 2007). \n\nThe phage display single chain antibody libraries were the recombinant phage libraries consisting of a large number of individual phages with different scFvs. In this large scFv libraries, after 3-4 rounds of screening, one or more scFvs will bind specifically to some molecule or the receptor on the surface of the target. This scFv provided an effective method for subsequent disease treatment or diagnosis (Li et al., 2022).",

            "text": "From the early 1990s, phage display technology was explored as a new method for generating mAbs (28,29). In this approach, the V gene repertoires were harvested from lymphocytes, and the combinations of VHs and VLs were cloned and expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage by fusion to its coat protein (Figure 1). Then, phage particles bearing expressed specific mAbs on their tips were selected and used in conventional assays. Compared with the hybridoma technology, which was practically confined to rodents, phage display has been successfully used to screen and isolate mAbs from any species whose immunoglobulin genes are known (30,31). In 2000, Rader et al. first described the whole process of selecting rabbit mAbs with phage display technology (32). This technology was successfully used in selecting and humanizing rabbit antibodies against human A33 antigen, a target antigen for the immunotherapy of colon cancer, and the obtained humanized antibodies retained high specificity and affinity for human A33 antigen (32). At present, antibody phage display is a major technical platform to generate fully human antibodies for therapeutic purpose for its high speed and ease of antibody generation and the ability to control various selection parameters in vitro (33). \n\nDependent on our knowledge of antibody structure, function, and sequence diversity, in addition to the insights from previous antibody libraries, a new synthetic antibody library technology was developed and used in mAb production by inserting precisely designed sequences into the antigen-combining site (34,35). This technology is accomplished based on genetically copying IgG fragments and on using molecular biology techniques to diversify antibody paratopes in vitro (36). Several synthetic antibody libraries (e.g., HuCAL and Ylanthia library) with multiple variable heavy and light chain framework regions were designed and used to isolate human mAbs optimized for molecular recognition (37)(38)(39)(40). With advances in library designs and selection methods, synthetic antibody libraries will become an indispensable tool for rapid generation of target-binding mAbs with exquisite specificity.",

The most critical parameter for all in vitro-based approaches is the quality of the antibody library. Concurrent evolution of the libraries has allowed display and selection technologies to reveal their full potential. They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design.",

Two major types of antibody libraries are distinguished: 1) immune libraries, and 2) universal libraries.\n\nImmune libraries are constructed from blood cell samples from immunized donors, which, in the case of human antibodies, is limited to donors who received vaccination, or patients who have suffered an infection or disease. In medical research, immune libraries are mostly used to discover antibodies against targets from infectious pathogens, e.g., antibodies neutralizing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from long-term non-progressor patients, 48 West Nile virus 49 or immunized cancer patients. 50 Immune libraries can also be generated from immunized animals, 51-55 including macaques which have antibodies that are very similar to those of humans. 56 Use of transgenic animals containing human antibody gene repertoire allows the discovery of human antibody from such immune libraries. 57 Immune libraries already contain affinity-matured antibodies, because they are generated from antibody repertoires that underwent antigen driven in vivo selection, but these extended somatic hypermutations may increase the risk of immunogenicity.\n\nUniversal libraries generated from natural na\u20ac \u0131ve human antibody gene repertoires are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have low risk of immunogenicity. These also called \"single-pot\" libraries contain a very broad repertoire of antigen specificities theoretically covering every possible antigen. 45,58 Na\u20ac \u0131ve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes from B cells of non-immunized donors, i.e., the IgM repertoire. These antibodies have already undergone in vivo selection for functional B cell receptors, including a selection for low immunogenicity and low toxicity. Nevertheless, antibodies to most if not all human antigens with relatively high affinities (low nanomolar to picomolar range) from na\u20ac \u0131ve antibody libraries have been described. 59 Affinity engineering, a well-established technology, can also be done by phage display. 60 Examples of na\u20ac \u0131ve universal libraries are the human Fab library constructed by de Haard and colleagues at Dyax (now Shire), 40 the scFv libraries from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT), 39,61",

At present, phage displayed antibody libraries rival traditional hybridoma strategy as a faster, better automatable and more cost-effective route to access monoclonal antibodies. Synthetic antibody repertoires can be even predesigned to exclude unwanted sequence motifs, such as mammalian glycosylation sites, and to limit the library to framework combinations that are well-known for their high expression and aggregation-resistance [4].\n\nSeveral coat proteins of filamentous phage have been used for antibody display, but a review of the sample group of articles confirmed that the gene 3 protein (p3) is dominating the field with single reports of using gene 9, 7 and 8 proteins (p9, p7 and p8) [5,6]. In the past, the effect of the signal peptides on the display of Ab fragments [7,8], the arrangement of the immunoglobulin domain genes on the phagemid [9] and the choice of helper phage used for rescue [10] were studied in detail, but there are no library scale studies concentrating on the effect of the fusion partner to the antibody library display and performance. Comparison studies are, however, crucial information for all phage display users as display method itself may have a major impact on the library function [11,12]. This aspect should be taken into consideration, when interpreting the selection outcome. In this study, identical Fab library diversity was displayed on the coat proteins p3, truncated p3 (p3\u0394, the Cterminal domain of p3 lacking infection domains N1 and N2) and p9. The Fab display efficiency of the libraries and the quality of the displayed repertoires were studied in detail followed by repeated panning experiments to monitor their performance in selections. In addition, the same VL/ VH repertoire was selected in parallel in scFv-p3\u0394 format and the effect of valency modulation by two helper phage, VCS-M13 and hyperphage, was examined.",

But, several technical challenges are associated with the selection process. For instance, during the panning step, the successful elution of the phages bound to the antigen is critical in order to avoid losing the most promising binders. Here, we present an efficient protocol to establish, screen and select synthetic libraries of domain antibodies using phage display. We do not only present suitable solutions to the above-mentioned challenges to improve elution by 50-fold, but we also present a step by step in-depth protocol with miniaturized volumes and optimized procedures to save material, costs and time for a successful phage display with domain antibodies. Hence, this protocol improves the selection process for an efficient handling process. The here presented library is based on the variable domain (vNAR) of the naturally occurring novel antibody receptor (IgNAR) from cartilage fishes.

            "text": "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance. This was further borne out by demonstrating proof of principle using delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) as antigen and isolating high affinity binders with neutralization of the DLL4-NOTCH1 interaction yielding IC 50 values below 10 nM (and equivalent to a benchmark antibody directed to DLL4). Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55]. \n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity. Many more examples of strategies applied to generate a robust phage display library for antibody discovery have been comprehensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,31] as well as the key attributes of historically important antibody libraries constructed for the identification of therapeutic antibodies [31]. \n\nDirect synthesis has enabled a much higher degree of precision and efficiency. Through solid-phase synthesis along with miniaturized chemistry, it is possible to synthesize oligonucleotides without randomization. Specifically, DNA synthesis can now be reliably performed on a large scale [57,58], such that millions of custom oligonucleotides can be synthesized as oligo pools on chip surfaces making the generation of large libraries of deliberately designed antibodies [59] that can be rapidly produced and screened in parallel. Significantly, such libraries need not be full-length antibodies as synthesis only needs to be restricted to antibody regions that contain CDR loops, such as VHH, scFv, and Fab antibody fragments. This approach opens the door to high-throughput screening opportunities. As with other synthesis methods, direct synthesis is not without its hurdles. Highly parallel direct oligonucleotide synthesis requires substantial infrastructure and automation.",

            "text": "The great advantage of the pIII phage library is that it can display large foreign proteins on its surface with one to five copies, that makes the pIII system the most commonly used in phage display libraries. The main advantage of this phagemid system is their smaller size and ease of cloning (B\u00e1b\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 2013;Tan et al., 2016). With the growing use of antibody fragments and singledomain antibodies, grows the necessity to improve the phage display systems. For instance, in order to improve the number of scFvs presented on filamentous phage particles, a new kind of phages were developed, known as hyperphages. Hyperphages have a pIII phenotype and are able to infect E. coli, however, lack the functional pIII gene, which means that the phagemid-encoded pIII-antibody fusion is the source of pIII in phage assembly. These unique features increase the phage particles that are carrying the scFv on their surface, increasing the antigen-binding activity more than 50% compared to 3% when conventional phages were used (Rondot et al., 2001;Pande et al., 2010). \n\nA critical feature to maximize the chance of discovering an antibody with the desired characteristics is the type of antibody source used. There are three main types of antibody libraries: immune, na\u00efve, and synthetic (Winter et al., 1994;Hoogenboom, 2002;K\u00fcgler et al., 2018). Immunized libraries use as antibody source the lymphoid tissues of a donor that was previously immunized with a specific antigen or, in some instances, individuals with a particular disease, such as cancer or a particular infection. Normally, this type of library results in higher-affinity antibodies than those generated from hybridomas and na\u00efve libraries, as gene fragments go through an in vivo maturation process (Winter et al., 1994;Griffiths and Duncan, 1998;Hoogenboom, 2002;Bradbury and Marks, 2004). However, as immunizations are required, immune libraries include certain limitations.",

            "text": "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

            "text": "The fundamental difference between immune or na\u00efve libraries and synthetic libraries consists in the origin of the sequences used to build the library. While immune and na\u00efve libraries are amplified from a natural source, synthetic library parts are diversified by design. In synthetic libraries the antibody diversity is designed in silico and then synthesized in a controlled fashion. \n\nThe ratio of naturally-derived and synthetically-designed parts varies in different libraries from semi-to fully synthetic. An advantage of synthetic diversification is that the composition of the CDRs can be exactly defined and controlled. \n\nSynthetic libraries can further be grouped according to the acceptor frameworks used, the origin or design of the sequence diversity within the CDR regions and the method used for building the library. \n\nThe first semi-synthetic libraries used a variety of different framework genes to keep diversity high [55,56,62,79]. In 1992 Hoogenboom and Winter described semi-synthetic scFv-antibody phage display libraries, comprising 49 germline VH sequences and a single V_lambda 3 light chain sequence [79]. Five or eight residues in the CDR-H3 were randomized in a PCR-based approach to generate libraries with a size of 1 \u00d7 10 7 . Subsequent libraries were based on the same set of acceptor VH frameworks, with the addition of 26 kappa and 21 lambda sequences [62]. Length variability was introduced in the CDR3s and diversity generated through randomization of 4-12 residues in CDR-H3, 1-3 residues in kappa CDR-L3 and 0-5 residues in lambda CDR-L3. In parallel, library size increased over three orders of magnitude up to 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . \n\nIn a similar approach, de Kruif and collaborators used all 49 human germline VH genes and seven different light chain genes (4 V_kappa, 3 V_lambda) with CDR-H3 length variability between 6-15 residues to construct a library of the size of 3.6 \u00d7 10 8 . \n\nThe shorter CDR-H3s of six amino acid length were fully randomized, whereas for the longer CDR-H3s the design included a stretch of fully randomized amino acid residues flanked by regions of lower diversity resembling human antibody sequences [56].",

            "text": "Over the last decades, monoclonal antibodies have substantially improved the treatment of several conditions. The continuous search for novel therapeutic targets and improvements in antibody\u2019s structure, demands for a constant optimization of their development. In this regard, modulation of an antibody\u2019s affinity to its target has been largely explored and culminated in the discovery and optimization of a variety of molecules. It involves the creation of antibody libraries and selection against the target of interest. In this work, we aimed at developing a novel protocol to be used for the affinity maturation of an antibody previously developed by our group. An antibody library was constructed using an in vivo random mutagenesis approach that, to our knowledge, has not been used before for antibody development. Then, a cell-based phage display selection protocol was designed to allow the fast and simple screening of antibody clones capable of being internalized by target cells. Next generation sequencing coupled with computer analysis provided an extensive characterization of the created library and post-selection pool, that can be used as a guide for future antibody development. With a single selection step, an enrichment in the mutated antibody library, given by a decrease in almost 50% in sequence diversity, was achieved, and structural information useful in the study of the antibody-target interaction in the future was obtained.",

            "text": "Therefore, it is vital to generate phage libraries that allow for the isolation of highly specific and diverse mAbs with high affinity against diverse antigens with optimal developability potential (128)(129)(130). \n\nCurrently, as a common practice in industrial pipelines, biopharmaceutical companies are implementing extensive developability assessments to determine the biochemical and biophysical features of antibody candidates to help identifying candidates with more favorable biophysical properties and to avoid difficulties during the downstream process (131,132). For example, in silico platforms, such as the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP) tool are used as a flagging system to predict mAbs with poor developability profiles by identifying anomalous values compared with therapeutic mAbs in clinical-stages. Indeed, features within the variable regions of mAbs, such as the total CDRs length, high hydrophobicity of V H and V L chains, lack of net charge symmetry, and/or the presence of patches of positive and negative charges were computationally predicted to be key factors in developability profiles of mAbs (133). \n\nThe probability of isolating high affinity, and more diverse mAbs that specifically bind random epitopes, increases significantly when biopanning campaigns are performed using larger antibody libraries. Library diversity is judged by how many functional antibody fragments are able to identify as many different antigens as possible (134). The bacterial transformation step during library construction; however, is a main practical bottleneck that limits the size of the library from exceeding 10 11 antibody variants, even after optimization and performing numerous electroporation steps. \n\nIdeally, antibody phage display libraries should not only be large and diverse, but also should display antibody variants as functional fragments. Issues related to the nucleotide sequences, such as the presence of stop codons, or the addition/deletion of nucleotides can occur during the library construction (135)(136)(137). These issues might inhibit the production of functional pIII-antibody fusions or change the reading frame of the antibody gene sequence, which could negatively affect their biophysical characteristics.",

However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. 32 Most of these libraries are produced from mouse, 33\u221237 but also other animals, such as chicken, 38,39 rabbit, 32,40 sheep, 41 monkey, 42 camel, 43 and shark, 44 have been used. Additionally, immunized human libraries have been made using blood from patients naturally infected with viruses or parasites. 5,45 n the other hand, nai \u0308ve antibody libraries can be constructed completely in vitro resulting in nonimmunized, 46 synthetic, 47 or semisynthetic libraries. 48 The use of synthetic repertoires bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences. 49 Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). 9 Synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce diversity into the CDRs.",

            "text": "The generation and selection of peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage marked the advent of display technologies. 75 The use of phage display for the generation and selection of antibody libraries, displayed in either scFv [76][77][78] or Fab 79,80 format, revolutionized the field of mAbs and antibody engineering in the early 1990s, arguably accelerated by an intense competition between researchers at the Medical Research Council (Cambridge, UK) and The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, California, USA). Over the past 20 years, phage display has proven to be the most robust and versatile mining tool for human antibody repertoires, yielding human mAbs to virtually any antigen of interest. 8 The process of multiple rounds of selection on a purified antigen or on antigen-expressing cells, referred to as panning, can be adapted to positively or negatively select a range of desired antibody properties, such as affinity, specificity, manufacturability and catalytic activity. While scFv (~25 kDa) and Fab (~50 kDa) still dominate the phage display format, human antibody repertoires have also been mined through the display and selection of single variable domains (~12.5 kDa) of heavy and light chain. 81,82 ypically, recombinant fusion to the N-terminus of phage protein pIII or a fragment of pIII provides the physical linkage of antibody fragment and phage, facilitating monovalent display in phagemid systems and multivalent display in phage systems. 83 ther multivalent display systems use phage proteins pVIII and pIX as fusion partners. 79,84 For the generation of human mAbs with high affinity, monovalent Fab display through phage protein pIII is generally preferred. 85 Phage display relies on the expression offering a diverse and attractive repertoire of antigen specificities readily available in the blood. As memory B cells contain only relatively small quantities of specific RNA, the successful cloning of both heavy and light chain variable domains from a single B cell poses a significant technical challenge. In spite of this, antibodies have successfully been cloned from single peripheral B cells, including mAbs against self-antigens, 61,62 tetanus toxoid 57 and HIV-1 gp140. 63",

            "text": "In the case of synthetic generation of diversity using trinucleotide synthesis, the method allows for the full control of the amino acid composition in the CDRs. This has, for example, been used to generate minimalistic antibody libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids in the randomized CDR region [19,20]. Semi-synthetic libraries with different combinations of synthetically and naturally host derived diversity have also been created. \n\nUnlike the immunized and na\u00efve libraries, the synthetic and semisynthetic libraries can be made using only one or few of the antibody framework repertoires. This reduces the contribution to diversity from the interface residues bordering the CDRs. It has, however, been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that some variable (V) segments are much more commonly used in functional antibodies than others. Furthermore there are great differences in the stability and suitability for bacterial expression between different frameworks [21,22]. \n\nFollowing the creation of large libraries of recombinant antibodies, systems, which allow sorting of the libraries, need to be introduced and here display of the recombinant antibodies on the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have played a pioneering role. The application known as \"phage display\" was first developed by G.P Smith in 1985 [23]. In phage display a foreign protein is expressed in fusion with one of the phage capsid proteins by cloning the foreign DNA sequence into the same reading frame as the gene of the chosen capsid protein. The major strength of phage display is the physical coupling between the phenotype (the fusion protein) and the genotype (the DNA inside the virion encoding the fusion protein). This coupling allows for high throughput selection of desirable properties of the fusion protein from libraries with billions of variants. There are two very important aspects of phage display selection of recombinant antibodies, namely the nature and quality of the material containing the antigen selected against, and perhaps more overlooked the quality and design of the displayed antibody library itself.",

            "text": "Once display of a parent protein has been demonstrated, it is possible to build display libraries of 10 6 -10 11 variants from which variants having a desired binding property can be selected. In contrast, other screening methods such as chemical library or cell based screening allow testing of hundreds or thousands of synthetic compounds, or tens of thousands of plated colonies. In fact, 10 10 variants in a phage display library is actually a small part of the available theoretical sequence space. That is, the first set of binders to an antigen of interest can be subsequently diversified, retaining the sequence features that initially caused binding. This iterative variegation was used successfully to create high-affinity protease inhibitors of human plasmin, plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and it has become a common strategy in affinity maturation of drug candidates identified by phage display. 4,5 hage display was first described in 1985 and used to display short peptide fragments, 6 and the first patent was filed in 1991 (US5223409). 7 Since then, phage display has proven to be a reliable method for the generation of peptides with potential therapeutic or diagnostic utility. 8 Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv) was reported in 1990, along with selective recovery of the phage on the basis of antigen binding. 9 It has since become a major discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 10 More recently described antibody libraries have displayed Fab fragments on the phage protein, which can be readily reformatted to full-length IgG antibodies, usually without loss of binding function. 11,12 ources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Phage display antibody libraries are a rich resource for discovery of potential therapeutic antibodies. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries are the most common format due to the efficient display of scFv by phage particles and the ease by which soluble scFv antibodies can be expressed for high-throughput screening. Typically, a cascade of screening and triaging activities are performed, beginning with the assessment of large numbers of E. coli-expressed scFv, and progressing through additional assays with individual reformatting of the most promising scFv to full-length IgG. However, use of high-throughput screening of scFv for the discovery of full-length IgG is not ideal because of the differences between these molecules. Furthermore, the reformatting step represents a bottle neck in the process because each antibody has to be handled individually to preserve the unique VH and VL pairing. These problems could be resolved if populations of scFv could be reformatted to full-length IgG before screening without disrupting the variable region pairing. Here, we describe a novel strategy that allows the reformatting of diverse populations of scFv from phage selections to full-length IgG in a batch format. The reformatting process maintains the diversity and variable region pairing with high fidelity, and the resulted IgG pool enables high-throughput expression of IgG in mammalian cells and cell-based functional screening. The improved process led to the discovery of potent candidates that are comparable or better than those obtained by traditional methods. This strategy should also be readily applicable to Fab-based phage libraries. Our approach, Screening in Product Format (SiPF), represents a substantial improvement in the field of antibody discovery using phage display.",

            "text": "Phage has a unique biological feature that allows it to efficiently link the genes coding the phage and the proteins presented on the surface. Such a feature makes phage an excellent tool for antibody screening. Phage display, a technique to study the protein-ligand interaction, has been widely used in laboratories. It is one of the most effective molecular diversity techniques. Phage display is based on the fact that an encapsulated library of genotypes can be directly associated with the presentation of a library of molecules on the phage surface. Phage display has been used in a variety of applications, including epitope mapping-where a library of peptide expressing phage is used to interact with a specific antibody, therefore to pinpoint the specific epitope sequence the antibody is interacting with [112]; ligand identification for receptors-similar to antibody mapping, peptides interacting with receptors can be identified [113]; protein-protein interactionswhere phage can present large proteins that are potentially interacting with a known binding partner, therefore to identify the unknown binding partners and to study the mechanism of interactions [114]; directed evolution of proteins-mutations conferring binding advantages between two proteins can be studied using a phage display library containing these variants [115]; drug discovery-peptides or ligands that can interact with drug targets can be presented through phage display [116]; and antibody screening-where a large library of antibody-displaying phage can be screened for the best antibodies that can interact with the target antigens [117]. \n\nPhage display has recently been used to screen for antibodies that can directly interact with neoantigens specific to cancer cells, thus producing a powerful method for establishing novel cancer therapeutic methods [7]. The screening procedure is conceptually simple. A DNA library encoding a large amount of antibody fragments can be synthesized or obtained, and cloned into phage vectors [118]. Phage carrying a specific DNA sequence can present an antibody or antibody fragment protein on its surface and therefore facilitate potential bindings between the phage and neoantigen targets [119]. When identifying the neoantigen binder phages, there are several critical steps that need to be ensured.",

            "text": "Antibodies represent the fastest-growing segment of all the therapeutic proteins in the biotechnology industry. 1 This remarkable progress is due in part to the exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibodies, compounded with their stability, solubility, clinical tolerability and relatively straightforward manufacturing process compared to other biologics. Yet, the overall process of bringing antibodies from the early discovery phase into the market is a long and expensive one, with the investment increasing exponentially as the potential antibody-based drug progresses from discovery to preclinical development to clinical trials and finally reaches the market. \n\nOver decades, as therapeutic antibodies either moved through the process required for commercialization 2 or failed to perform in preclinical development and clinical trials, it has become clear that many of the properties that account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials, collectively called developability, 3,4 are encoded in the primary amino acid sequence of the antibody. This implies that the developability profile of an antibody can be engineered in the early discovery phase, where the costs of development are still relatively modest. Hence, there is substantial interest in, and demand for, the design and implementation of more robust and efficient discovery platforms capable of generating antibody sequences with the optimal developability profile in the earliest stages of development. \n\nPhage display has served as a key enabling technology for therapeutic antibody discovery. 5 This technology platform, which was developed in the late 1980s and perfected during the past three decades, [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] rests on the principle that more diverse, functional and larger libraries produce more diverse, specific and higher affinity antibodies. To generate larger and more diverse antibody libraries, three main approaches have been described in the literature, including: 1) na\u00efve libraries composed of natural diversity; 12 2) libraries based on rational design and synthesis of selected scaffolds; 9,11,14 and 3) semisynthetic libraries, which combine synthetic and natural fragments. 10 irst-generation phage display antibody libraries were na\u00efve. 12 Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library.",

            "text": "During recent decades, the merge of combinatorial chemistry and biological selection has led to the birth of biological combinatorial libraries, which have revolutionized the methodology of ligand discovery [1]. These libraries have facilitated the screening of large pools of randomly generated molecules and allowed for the selection of specific ligands from a huge variety of genetic variants in one test tube. Phage display, first introduced in 1985 by George Smith [2], is recognized as the most commonly used combinatorial library strategy for the identification of novel peptides toward biological targets. In this approach, the in-frame fusion of exogenous oligonucleotides into one of the phage surface protein genes results in the expression of foreign peptides as part of the relevant coat protein. Thus, a physical association is created between the displayed peptide (phenotype) and the corresponding genetic information in the phage genome (genotype), which forms the Viruses 2022, 14, 2402 2 of 16 basis of phage display library selection. The surface display enables peptides to interact with target molecules, giving rise to the selection of clones whose displayed peptides bind specifically to the target [3]. Commercial libraries have played a key role in expanding the scope of the phage display field and a vast number of peptide discovery studies have been conducted based on these libraries. Both filamentous and lytic phages have been used to develop commercial phage display libraries provided by New England Biolabs (M13), Creative Biolabs (M13, T4, and T7), and Novagen (T7). The Ph.D. TM libraries, developed by New England Biolabs (NEB), are the most widely used commercial phage display peptide libraries. \n\nLibrary construction is an important step in the phage display workflow. The probability of finding variants with desired properties is significantly dependent on the quality of the library, which is mainly defined by the library diversity [4,5]. A fundamental prerequisite for a high-quality and high-diversity library is the random representation of amino acids in the constructed na\u00efve library [6]. The random distribution of amino acids ensures that the identified peptides have become enriched in the recovered pool due to a genuine selection, and not in a biased target-independent manner.",

            "text": "Phage antibody libraries are classed as na\u00efve, semisynthetic, synthetic or immune libraries [2]. The latter are produced by cloning the antibody genes from immunised animals (e.g. [7][8][9]) or diseased or vaccinated humans [10,11] and are directed towards a single or limited number of antigens. Na\u00efve phage display libraries are produced from the natural antibody repertoire of donors. Alternatively, phage display libraries can be produced using a relatively small diversity of natural antibody sequences whose diversity is increased through mutating one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (semi-synthetic libraries). Libraries can also be based on a single or very low number of \"scaffold\" sequences with introduced diversity in the CDRs (synthetic libraries). Immune libraries require Fig. 1 Representations of the different structures of antibodies and antibody fragments for phage display. The multidomain structure of conventional IgG and heavy chain antibody (camelid and shark) (a). Antibody fragments can be displayed on phage as Fabs, scFvs or nanobodies (V H Hs or V NAR , derived from camelid or shark, respectively). The synthetic scFab-Fc dimer is also shown (b). V variable domain, C constant domain, H heavy chain, L light chain immunisation and library cloning for each antigen but small repertoire libraries (~ 10 6 ) usually facilitate the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [7][8][9]). On the other hand, na\u00efve or synthetic/semi-synthetic libraries (collectively known as single-pot libraries) can be used against any antigen but are required to have very high diversity (typically > 10 10 ) to allow the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [12][13][14][15][16]). \n\nIn terms of antibody formats, Fabs consist of the VH-CH1 and VL-CL chains, one of which is fused to the pIII protein [17]. In phage display systems these two chains are usually expressed separately and assemble into the Fab format within the periplasm of the bacteria via a disulphide bond linkage.",

In this review, the lifecycle of the M13 phage and the basics of phage display technology are presented together with important factors influencing the success rates of phage display experiments. Moreover, the pros and cons of different antigen display methods and the use of na\u00efve versus immunized phage display antibody libraries is discussed, and selected examples from the field of antivenom research are highlighted. This review thus provides in-depth knowledge on the principles and use of phage display technology with a special focus on discovery of antibodies that target animal toxins.",

            "text": "Antibody phage libraries are widely used to select antibodies against diverse targets. This method can be very effectively scaled up and used for high-throughput approaches, [27][28][29][30][31] with the antibodies obtained comparable to those obtained by immunization. 27,28 The ability to carry out industrial-scale selections against different targets in parallel depends, however, on the availability of suitable amounts of phage antibody library. Here, we show that effective phage antibody libraries can be produced in large volumes using bioreactors, and their quality, as assessed by titer, display level and selection success, is indistinguishable from libraries made in shake flasks. The amount of phage antibody library produced in a single 5 l stirred-tank bioreactor run is equivalent to the production of approximately 20 2.5 l shake flasks, -sufficient for 1,000 selections, -but the bioreactor-based protocol requires substantially less effort. The use of bioreactors also facilitates standardization of the protocol, ensuring minimal lot-to-lot variation in the quality of antibody library produced. \n\nAlthough the use of fermenters to produce large quantities of phage antibody libraries has not been previously described, phage peptide libraries have been produced using this approach. 32 Apart from the difference in size of the displayed molecule (short peptide versus 25 kDa scFv), the biggest difference between display of peptides or antibodies is the nature of the vector used. Peptide display usually uses filamentous phage vectors, in which it is sufficient to grow bacteria containing the vector for phage displaying peptides to be produced. In the case of antibody libraries, phagemid vectors are usually used, and the vector alone is unable to generate phage particles unless the bacteria carrying them has been co-infected with helper phage, which provides all the other proteins needed for phage particle assembly. Here we show that, notwithstanding these differences, the fermentation conditions described for peptide phage library production are applicable to phagemid antibody libraries as well, with titers 4-5 fold higher than those obtained by growth in flasks.",

            "text": "There are two very important aspects of phage display selection of recombinant antibodies, namely the nature and quality of the material containing the antigen selected against, and perhaps more overlooked the quality and design of the displayed antibody library itself. Numerous phage display antibody libraries have been created over the years with many different specialized features, and the creation of new libraries continues as knowledge and technology expands [10,15,18,20,[24][25][26]. In this paper we report the construction of a novel domain antibody library with restricted randomizations at 4 and 7 positions in the CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. This was done by the use of trinucleotide synthesized oligonucleotides and an innovative PCR free annealing strategy designed to avoid clonal bias due to sequence and amplification of non-unique clones caused by the PCR cycling. The diversity of the library was designed to reflect the amino acid composition of CDR regions from known functional human antibody clones, combined with additional knowledge of binding characteristics from specific amino acids. The library was furthermore designed to be highly modular by including unique restriction sites surrounding all three CDRs, the leader peptide, and the tag region. The library was based on the aggregation resistant HEL4 domain antibody scaffold with the inclusion of a hydrophilic mutation at position 29 previously reported to improve solubility.",

            "text": "Ideally, the size of a library should be equal to its effective size, meaning that all the 10 11 antibody variants comprising the library are displayed as functional antibody molecules on the phage surface. Nonetheless, the quality of the gene synthesis, either using RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for na\u00efve libraries [9] or using chemical means for synthetic and semisynthetic libraries [29,38], affects the effective size of the libraries. Nucleotide sequences with stop codons leading to truncated sequences do not produce functional antibody fragments fused to a virion particle. Insertions or deletions of one or two nucleotides change the reading frame of the gene sequence generating truncated sequences, with stretches of amino acids that may impair folding or clones with solvent-exposed hydrophobic amino acids resulting in aggregation. Moreover, some in-frame antibody genes have low expression due to suboptimal codon usage in E. coli and/or inefficient translocation in the cell compartments [39]. These variants are displayed in low proportion with respect to other variants or are not displayed at all on the phage surface, which further erodes the effective size of the libraries. Furthermore, library synthesis methods based on mixtures of oligonucleotides or degenerated NNK codons might result in a reduction of diversity at the amino acid level due to the redundancy of the genetic code and/or encoded unwanted amino acids at targeted positions for diversification. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the percentage of open reading frames (ORFs) and percentage of antibody expression or display of the libraries listed in Table 1. It should be noted that some authors do not report the percentage of ORFs and/or display, whereas, others measured these parameters in diverse ways. For instance, Xoma [26] calculated the percentage of ORFs based on the number of complete sequences between the start of signal sequences through to the end of both the V L and V H for XFab1 and from the start of the signal sequence through to the end of the V L for XscFv2.",

            "text": "Today, a wide variety of antibody phage display libraries exist, with the antibodies displayed either as Fabs, scFvs (single-chain variable fragments) or sdAbs (single-domain antibodies) in fusion with typically the gene III coat protein (6,7) (Fig. 1). The small size and solubility of the phage particle (up to 10 13 particles/ml) has allowed repertoire sizes of up to 10 11-12 to be efficiently displayed and manipulated, which improves the likelihood of finding suitable antibodies (8). These antibody sequences can be obtained from natural sources (animal or human) or synthetically constructed [usually a mix of pre-defined framework regions (FRs) with randomized sequences in the CDRs] and isolation of specific sequences is carried out by repeated enrichment against the target of interest. \n\nThe defining attribute of all phage display libraries is the physical linking of antibody phenotype (specificity and affinity) with genotype (sequence) via the phage particle-this allows for in vitro selection on immobilized antigen or whole cells (Fig. 2). As this method by-passes the immune system, the usual factors that influence antibody development and limit diversity based on those that can be isolated in animals are not applicable. As such, antibodies can be isolated against targets that have low immunogenicity in animals (nonproteinaceous antigens), to regions of a protein not usually targeted due to the presence of immunodominant epitopes elsewhere, or to hydrophobic targets that are challenging for in vivo manipulation (9)(10)(11). As such, phage display offers high potential for discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies that cannot be generated naturally through in vivo immunization or infection. Furthermore, the ability to display synthetic repertoires devoid of any negative selection has made this technique a key method for the generation of potent fully human antibody therapeutics against self-antigens (12). Nixon et al. provide an in-depth review of the clinical development of such drugs (13). Polyclonal phage expressing recombinant antibodies on their surface is applied to target antigen presented as either immobilized on a magnetic bead, polystyrene surface or on the surface of a whole cell.",

            "text": "Phage display libraries based on M13 filamentous bacteriophage can present a vast diversity of antibody fragments on the pIII minor coat protein, utilising either a phagemid or phage vector system to encode the antibody-coat protein fusion (the different display systems including mutated helper phage are reviewed elsewhere, [1][2][3]). The presence of the antibody on the surface of the phage particle is accompanied by the gene for the antibody being packaged within the phage. In this way the phenotype (antibody binding) and the genotype (antibody gene) are linked [2]. Within standard panning methods, the highly diverse antibody library is introduced to an immobilised antigen and unbound phage washed away, bound phage are then eluted, usually by a shift in pH and the resulting sub-library propagated in Escherichia coli to amplify each phage clone. Such panning cycles are usually carried out 3-5 times to enrich for phage-antibodies that bind to the target antigen and hundreds of single phage clones are then isolated, propagated and tested in ELI-SAs [2]. More recently, screening has used next generation sequencing platforms to sequence thousands to millions of antibody genes contained within the selected sub-libraries of phage after panning. Sequencing usually targets the whole VH or the CDRH3 domain. These methods allow a thorough investigation of the enrichment of phage clones, even when they are minor components of the sub-libraries [4][5][6]. Phage display libraries can enable the identification of a variety of antibodies with desirable binding properties including antibodies that bind to toxic or non-immunogenic antigens. \n\nNaturally occurring or designed antibody domains have been developed that are suited for phage display but still retain the binding properties of a full-length IgG (Fig. 1). These domains include antigen binding fragments (Fab), single chain Fv (scFv) and single domain antibodies (nanobodies). The latter include camelid V H H and shark V NAR (New Antigen Receptor). \n\nPhage antibody libraries are classed as na\u00efve, semisynthetic, synthetic or immune libraries [2].",

            "text": "The importance of phage display platforms was recognized with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for the 'phage display of peptides and antibodies' in 2018. Phage display libraries are widely used to identify novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and map the binding sites or epitopes of proteins or antibodies. Phage display technology has also emerged as a robust platform for drug discovery in biotechnology due to its ability to facilitate the efficient identification of antibodies in vitro (Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021). This technology facilitates extensive applications in biomedical research, drug development, and bioengineering (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nOne key advancement that has greatly improved the efficiency and scalability of phage display technology is Oligonucleotide Library Synthesis (OLS). OLS allows for the high-throughput synthesis of numerous oligonucleotide sequences, which can then be used to create highly diverse peptide libraries. Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a technique derived from traditional phage display that utilizes OLS to encode peptide libraries. PhIP-Seq enables the efficient detection of antibodies on a large scale by employing a high-capacity phage display peptide library, antibody immunoprecipitation, and highthroughput sequencing (Mohan et al., 2018). This technique can detect antibodies against hundreds of thousands of peptides and provide a comprehensive mapping of antibody profiles, making it particularly advantageous in studying complex diseases or immune responses to large pathogen families. Moreover, its high multiplexing capability allows for the analysis of multiple samples simultaneously, significantly reducing the cost of DNA sequencing per sample and enabling the analysis of large sets of samples. With these aforementioned characteristics, PhIP-Seq facilitates the discovery of novel antibodies and enhances our understanding of the immune response. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, In this review, we highlight the research progress of PhIP-Seq technology, encompassing the entire process from the library's design to the data analysis. We have also summarized current challenges and potential solutions for them. Furthermore, we explore prospective directions for future development in PhIP-Seq technology and its applications.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of hybridoma (K\u00f6hler and Milstein, 1975), new perspectives have been launched in the field of antibody research and clinical development. Although promising results have been achieved, as advances in molecular tools and the disadvantages of hybridoma were more evident, new alternatives for antibody development were pursued. Due to its characteristics, display selection technologies have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods. Nowadays, phage display is the most widespread and powerful display technology to select antibodies and peptides. Barderas and Benito-Pe\u00f1a (2019) awarded with the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the development of phage display for peptides and antibodies. The phage display created a fast route for the approval and development of molecules selected by this technique. The biggest advantage of this display method is the linkage between phenotype and encapsulated genotype (Tan et al., 2016). Furthermore, the use of phage display facilitates the cloning process due to the phage's genome small size and the high efficiency of phage infection. There are still other advantages that can be associated with this methodology, such as the small size of the phages, easy manipulation, safety, low cost of phage preparation and propagation, and the possibility of high-throughput screening of peptides and antibodies (B\u00e1b\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 2013). Additionally, upon the construction of the phage library, phages can been screened against any target antigen within several weeks (Greenwood et al., 1991). However, as with all techniques there are some pitfalls. The capacity of the phage display library and its molecular diversity is limited since it depends on bacterial transformation, phage packing and transmembrane secretion processes (Shim, 2017). Furthermore, the expression system is also limited because not all the sequences can be efficiently expressed in phages, considering that certain proteins require the correct folding to acquire its functions (Alfaleh et al., 2020). Nevertheless, phage display continues to be considered the best tool to detect the protein spatial structure, exploring binding sites between receptors and ligands, as well as the search for ligands with high affinity and biological activity.",

            "text": "The direct detection of Ag85 in patient serum has been proposed as an effective diagnostic for TB [14,15]. This requires stable specific high affinity antibodies, which to date have been either polyclonal [15,31] or monoclonal [14,15,32], obtained by immunization. More recently, methods to generate antibodies using in vitro methods, such as phage and yeast display, have been developed. These have significant advantages over traditional immunization, including the speed with which antibodies can be selected and the ability to screen many more clones for highly specific properties. More significantly, once selected, it is relatively straightforward to improve many antibody properties such as: a) affinity [33,34]; b) specificity, [35,36]; and c) expression levels [37,38]. In this paper, we have combined the two most powerful in vitro antibody selection platforms (phage and yeast display) to select a large number of antibodies against Ag85. This panel comprises a far greater antibody variety than usually obtained when carrying out phage display alone, significantly increasing the number of available anti-Ag85 antibodies. We believe this is due to the more efficient harvesting of the available antibody diversity. Depending upon the efforts expended in creating them, na\u0131 \u00a8ve antibody libraries have enormous diversity (.10 9 different clones) [20,22,39,40]. Theoretical [41] and practical [42,43] studies have shown that, depending upon the desired affinity, a library size of ,10 7 clones should yield approximately one specific antibody, and that the number of selected antibodies should increase proportionally with library size. However, this has not been the case with phage display, where, unless especially heroic efforts are made [44], only 5-30 different specific antibodies are usually selected from large libraries. This is likely due to additional biases occurring during phage display selection [45] that do not appear to occur in yeast display [20], probably because expression control is tighter. \n\nThis combination of technologies exploits the advantages of each of the two platforms. After carrying out one to two rounds of selection in phage, the diversity is reduced from 10 9-11 to 10 5-6 .",

Using phage display technology, single chain fragment variable (scFv) can be screened, replacing the disadvantage of the large size of traditional antibodies. Phage display single chain antibody libraries have significant biological implications. Here we describe the types of antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and scFvs. In addition, we describe the phage display system, phage display single chain antibody libraries, screening of specific antibodies by phage libraries and the application of phage libraries.",

Later studies showed that, by generating larger na\u00efve libraries with library size of 10 10 -10 12 , antibodies with low-to sub-nanomolar affinity can be directly isolated. 90,91,93,[114][115][116][117][118] Of note, the large na\u00efve library and related phage display technology developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology has led to approval of six mAbs: adalimumab, 119 belimumab, 120 moxetumomab pasudotox, 121,122 raxibacumab, 123 emapalumab, 124 and tralokinumab. 125 Another example is the n-CoDeR library in which heavy and light chain CDR segments were separately amplified by using primers specific to VH3-23 and VL1-47 germlines. The six CDRs were then reassembled in a single light and heavy chain framework that is well-presented in human repertoire and wellexpressed in bacterial host cells. 94 This strategy overcomes the drawback with conventional na\u00efve antibody phage libraries in which part of the diversity might be lost due to low expression and/or display level of certain germline genes in prokaryotic system. The n-CoDeR library was used to discover five mAbs and their derivatives that entered clinical trials. [126][127][128][129][130] In our experience, high hit rate (>90%) can be readily achieved and antibodies with high affinity (low nanomolar) can be routinely isolated from a large na\u00efve library (library size = 10 12 ) constructed in-house. Depending on the target, 10-20% of total sequences screened are unique.\n\nTaken together, first-generation phage libraries demonstrated that antibody discovery can be performed completely in vitro and antibodies with high affinity and sequence diversity can be isolated directly from phage libraries.",

Several screening strategies can be further developed to reduce this bias, including (1) masking unwanted epitopes with blocking antibodies (e.g., anti-Fc antibodies); \n\n(2) eluting target-bound phage by competition with specific soluble antigens [38,79,80]. Despite these strategies, selection-related, target-unspecific residual clones contaminate the sub-libraries and are amplified during E. coli infection steps. Obviously, this issue also disturbs the screening of phage display peptide libraries. The Huang's and Smith's labs have developed bioinformatic tools, mainly based on the target-unrelated peptides data bank (predicted and verified) to discard a priori these clones streamlining the peptide discovery process [52,[81][82][83][84][85][86].

            "text": "In the majority of cases the identification of a therapeutic target necessarily precedes the selection of a therapeutic mAb, whereas we demonstrate that this ''therapeutic target to mAb'' approach can be reversed. Here we describe a strategy which enables the identification of antibodies that bind unknown receptors with a specific expression profile. The first key stage of this strategy is the selection of a relatively low-complexity, ''specialized'' library containing phage-Abs that bind to MPs (the Membranome collection). The second critical element is the development of a technology that enables an efficient differential screening of phage clones, using minimal amounts of biological samples. \n\nWe generated the Membranome collection by panning a phage-Ab library on cultured cells This process simultaneously selects ligands for several cell surface receptors. The complexity of the library, the display level of the target receptor on the cell surface and the affinity of the interaction between phage-Ab and the target receptor strongly affect this process. All these factors interact in a competitive environment where biological viability of the phage-Ab also plays a major role. Empirically, however, we observed that on average the number of new clones identified by panning on each different cell line remains relatively constant, indicating that we are still far from saturation of the library sequence diversity. \n\nThe amino acid sequence of VH3-CDR3, the hypervariable region which in most cases acts as a major binding determinant [6][7][8], is a unique and distinctive feature of each member of the repository. The Membranome phage-Ab collection hosts VH-CDR3 sequences ranging from 3 to 25 residues, with the frequency peaking around 10 residues, and analysis of the complete scFv region reveals a broad set of germline families. Together these two findings indicate that a wide variety of binding motifs are present in the collection. We estimate that the current version of the repository (10,000 clones) should target between 500 and 1,000 different antigens, corresponding to 10-20% of the complete Membranome.",

Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, constitute interesting sources of diversity because they are rich in B cells, part of which can be affinity matured. These organs, however, differ in their anatomical structure, reflecting the different fluids they drain, which affects the B cell repertoires. The CDRH3 repertoires from these organs, extracted from na\u00efve or immunized mice, were compared in the context of phage display libraries using human antibody framework families. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that all libraries displayed different CDRH3 repertoires, but the one derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice was the most diverse. Library performance was assessed by in vitro selection. For both organs, immunization increased substantially the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen. The library derived from lymph nodes from na\u00efve mice, however, was the most effective in generating diverse and high affinity candidates. These results illustrate that the use of a biased CDRH3 repertoire increases the performance of libraries, but reduces the clonal diversity, which may be detrimental for certain strategies. \n\nhighlighted by the finding that hybridomas generated using B cells isolated from lymph nodes tend to provide higher affinity monoclonal antibodies. 21,22",

            "text": "In general, combinatorial antibody libraries are constructed from mRNA or 2 of 11 RNA extracted from B cells of immunized or na\u00efve donors. Because the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) representing the immunoglobulin geneencoding repertoire are known, we can use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then specific primers to amplify different VH and VL gene families. These variable regions of antibody repertoires are then ligated to the phage display vector (phagemid), with the net result that the antibody is expressed on the surface of the phage and the gene encoding of the antibody is in the phage genome. The antibody-encoding gene is inserted into a phage coat protein gene causing the antibody fragment to be displayed on the outside of the phage, which results in a connection between genotype and phenotype. Once produced, the antibody library in the phage can be bound to an immobilized antigen. This allows us to use multiple binding and elution cycles for selection of antibodies with high affinity and specificity. Phage binders are screened by ELISA, then DNA sequences are analyzed and cloned into appropriate expression vectors to produce antibodies, or various antibody formats, for functional analysis (Figure 1). The antibody format in the phage display library can be a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or Fab fragments. Due to the small size and high solubility of phage particles (10 13 particles/mL), a library size of up to 10 11 independent clones can be effectively generated, and an extensive antibody diversity can be displayed in a single library. One advantage of combinatorial antibody library technology is the diversity of binders. Another advantage is the ability to directly generate human antibodies in vitro. Since many important therapeutic antibodies are antibodies to self-antigens, which is forbidden by tolerance, in vitro generation allows the by-passing of tolerance and the generation of antibodies to self-antigens such as cell surface proteins, or self-products such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1).",

            "text": "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and",

            "text": "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nFigure 1. Different types of phage display libraries. Phage display technology enables the selection and identification of peptides, antibodies, or enzymes that bind to specific target molecules. This approach entails generating filamentous fusion phages that showcase random foreign peptides or antibodies linked to a phage coat protein. Subsequently, the filamentous phages are assembled into a phage display library comprising random peptide sequences or antibodies. \n\nConstructing a phage display library involves several key steps aimed at generating a diverse repertoire of displayed peptides or proteins for subsequent screening against target molecules. Initially, a source of genetic material encoding the desired peptides or proteins is obtained, which can include synthetic DNA sequences, cDNA libraries, or genomic DNA. Next, this genetic material is ligated into a phagemid vector, which contains the genetic elements necessary for phage display, including a phage coat protein gene fused to the peptide or protein of interest. The ligated DNA is then introduced into competent Escherichia coli cells via transformation, where it undergoes replication and amplification. Following transformation, the bacterial cells are infected with helper phage, which provides the necessary components for packaging the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The infected cells are then cultured to allow for phage production, and the resulting phage display library is harvested by collecting the culture supernatant or lysing the bacterial cells to release the phage particles. The library can be further characterized by sequencing a subset of clones to assess diversity and by performing binding assays to confirm the display of the desired peptides or proteins (Figure 2) [12].",

Our antibodies are single domains from the variable part of the heavy chain (V H ) of natural antibodies. Antibodies in a library share a common scaffold of ' 100 amino acids and differ only at four consecutive sites of their third complementary determining region (CDR3), which is known to be important for binding affinity and specificity. A library comprises all combinations of amino acids at these four sites and therefore consists of a total of N = 20 4 ' 10 5 distinct sequences x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ). Initial populations include a total of 10 11 sequences, corresponding to \ufffd 10 6 copies of each of the distinct \ufffd 10 5 sequences when a single library is considered. Physically, these populations are made of phages, each presenting at its surface one antibody and containing the corresponding sequence.\n\nAn experiment consists in a succession of cycles, each composed of two steps (Fig 5A). In the first step, the phages are in solution with the targets, which are attached to magnetic beads and in excess relative to the phages to limit competitive binding (see S1 Text 1.1). The beads are retrieved with a magnet and washed to retain the bound antibodies. In the second step, the selected phages are put in presence of bacteria which they infect to make new phages, thus amplifying retained sequences. A population of \ufffd 10 11 phages is thus reconstituted. Both the selection for binding to the target and the amplification can possibly depend on the sequence of the antibody.\n\nWe define the enrichment s(x) of sequence x to be proportional to the probability for sequence x to pass one cycle. As the targets are in excess relative to the antibodies, enrichments are independent of the cycle c (see S1 Text 1.1). In the limit of infinite population sizes, s(x) is proportional to the ratio f c (x)/f c\u22121 (x) of the frequencies f c (x) after any two successive cycles c \u2212 1 and c. To estimate these enrichments, about 10 6 sequences are sampled before and after a cycle and read by high-throughput sequencing. Given the counts n c\u22121 (x",

The physical linkage of antibody and phage pIII protein is usually achieved by genetic fusion of antibody and pIII, but there are also other approaches using conjugation via free cysteines 34 or dimerization motifs 35 or protein A-derived ZZ domains. 36 Small recombinant antibody fragments are commonly used for phage display, e.g., scFv [37][38][39] or fragment antigen-binding (Fab). 40,41 The smallest antibody fragments are human (single) domain (VH) antibodies (dAbs) or the variable domains of the naturally occurring camel heavy chain antibodies (VHH).

            "text": "We describe here a novel, cost-effective and accelerated approach to therapeutic antibody discovery, that couples de novo human antibodies derived in silico, which we refer to as \"humanoid antibodies\", with high-throughput screening technologies. We have developed the antibody-GAN, a new in silico engineering approach to designing a novel class of diverse antibody therapeutics that mimic somatically hypermutated human repertoire response. The platform allows antibody biasing towards desirable developability attributes, such as suitability for common protein manufacturing processes, high stability during long-term storage conditions, low viscosity for injectability at high concentration and long elimination half-lives to reduce dosing frequency [3]. Here, we employed the antibody-GAN to design and construct a 1 billion theoretical diversity phage Fab display library. This library is in process of expanding to over 50 billion theoretical diversity by 2024. The first validation campaign described herein was conducted with the intent to discover antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and demonstrate library utility. Phage display methodology has proven to be a robust, and efficient platform to discover and develop human therapeutic antibodies [15]. Our antibody-GAN generated phage library is comprised of 25 sublibraries, five heavy chain germlines paired combinatorially with five variable chain (4 kappa and 1 lambda) germlines. Fv sequence diversity encompasses both framework and CDR regions, which drives affinity, efficacy, and developability [3]. Most synthetic libraries focus only on CDR diversity [16]. Due to the sensitive balance between affinity, efficacy, and developability, it is likely advantageous to consider the entire Fv sequence space when engineering the optimal therapeutic candidate. Since it is known that the framework residues can impact both developability and binding [19,21]. We, therefore, chose to engineer this degree of diversity when designing J.HAL \u00ae . Both in vitro and in vivo antibody discovery methodologies have limitations whether it is library diversity or lack of an appropriate immune response. We do not know how J.HAL \u00ae will compare and perform against any particular methodology or antigen.",

            "text": "NGS technologies have been used in combination with phage display in a number of applications. 24,25 While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length 26,27 and signal integrity 16 of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. 28,29 Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. 30 Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123. Mining these two independent libraries enabled the identification of a large and diverse panel of high-quality antibodies.\n\nHemadou et al. demonstrated that the combination of SMRT sequencing with circular consensus adapter ligation allowed the identification of full-length scFvs from an enriched phage display library. By tracking a manually selected clone, they identified its presence in the top 100 of the pool of reads and they were able to determine an accuracy of >99.9% for complete sequences of inserts approaching 1,000 bp. Although this supports the robustness of the combinatorial method, it does not give insights on the functionality and diversity of the scFvs contained in the phage library. 13 Similarly, Han and colleagues used this approach to investigate phage display libraries that had shown high clonality using traditional screening methods and, although they identified several new clones, they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of",

            "text": "The performance of an antibody library is directly linked to its quality. The salient features governing the library quality control include (a) the number of clones with phagemids harboring the insert, i.e., scFv or Fab, (b) the number of clones expressing phages carrying inserts, and (c) the number of clones capable of soluble expression of inserts. The key parameter of an antibody library's quality is its complexity, also called diversity. It is an estimate of distinct elements in that collection. It directly reflects the probability of screening an antibody clone from the library against a given antigen, of sufficiently higher affinity. Theoretically, the probability of finding a functional antibody against a given antigen is higher in large complex or more diverse libraries than in a less complex or diverse library. It is approximated by the transformation efficiency of the bacteria used to amplify the library. Despite the simplicity and significance of this concept, the accurate and reliable quantification of this prime feature was not possible and is still lacking [29,30]. PCR screening of individual clones to determine the presence of insert, dot plot analysis to detect both antibody fragment displaying phages, and soluble antibody fragment synthesized by the screened clones, and further characterization of the few hundred positive clones through DNA fingerprinting and sequencing are still considered standard practices [31,32]. Recently, a reseach group used a PCR-free next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach coupled with new bioinformatic tools for the reliable and accurate estimation of the diversity of a library [33]. However, further optimization and advancement in NGS is required to fully exploit the potential of this incredible technology in tackling the antibody library diversity quality assessment.",

Codon bias will also be introduced into libraries due to different coupling efficiencies of the 4 bases when using machine mixed bases during oligonucleotide synthesis (as was the case here).\n\nHaving demonstrated that the libraries have high diversity and limited bias in terms of overrepresented peptides and amino acid usage, they were tested in terms of yielding ligands with specific binding. The peptide library was used to successfully epitope map a monoclonal antibody where the sequencing of thirteen binders revealed eight clones with a consensus motif that matched the known epitope. The panning of the VHH libraries against recombinant human collagen type I (Sigma) over 3 rounds produced a single dominant positive binder. The antibody CDR sequence could be cloned directly into an expression vector containing the scaffold VHH by whole-plasmid PCR. The recombinant MBP-VHH clone was produced at high levels in bacterial expression culture and retained its specific binding ability. This could represent an effective recombinant antibody synthesis strategy to allow direct cloning from NGS datasets describing the enrichment of phage during panning experiments, the so-called next-generation phage display. This is an alternative approach to using antibody libraries with multiple regions of heterogeneity, requiring the rescue of a particular antibody sequence (identified from NGS data) from a sub-library of enriched phage clones, which is a challenging and often inefficient process [40,41].\n\nOverall, the use of whole-plasmid PCR with type IIS restriction enzymes to facilitate seamless cloning of peptide diversity into phage display systems allows a rapid and relatively simple library construction method. Here, it was used to produce 4 libraries of more than a billion ligands with relatively low bias, and the libraries could be used to yield phage clones with specific binding characteristics.",

Effective development of therapeutic antibodies demands high-quality molecules to meet strict manufacturing requirements and success in clinical applications. The first step in antibody discovery is the identification of potential candidate binding targets of interest, with two main methods used: hybridoma generation (or more recently single-cell cloning methods) from the immunization of normal or transgenic animals, and display methods based on naive or immune libraries. The source of diversity for libraries from which antibodies are selected has taken many formats: immune repertoires, generated from immunized animals or humans seropositive for a target; natural naive, derived from the B lymphocytes of nonimmunized donors [1][2][3] ; synthetic, in which diversity is derived from oligonucleotides [4][5][6][7][8][9] ; semi-synthetic, combining synthetic and natural diversity 10 ; and PCR-based recombinatorial approaches in which natural CDR diversity is shuffled within a fixed scaffold 11,12 . \n\nSpecific binders are selected from libraries displayed using platforms such as phage/phagemid 1,13,14 , yeast 15,16 , ribosome 17,18 , and mammalian display [19][20][21] , with phage and yeast display being the most commonly used. These methods couple phenotype to genotype: the gene encoding the displayed antibody is coupled to the antibody itself, allowing the cloning of antibody genes on the basis of the properties (e.g., binding activity) of the encoded antibodies. Once selected, the affinity or specificity of an antibody can be further improved by applying the same display methods to derivative libraries. \n\nThe key feature of any compound library, including antibody libraries, is diversity. In the case of antibody libraries, this is often measured by counting the number of clones obtained after library transformation. However, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 .",

            "text": "Phage display was first described by George Smith in the 1980s for studying proteinprotein interactions [10]. Since then, the phage display technology has evolved to be of utility within many other areas of biomedical sciences, including the study of antibodies [11]. Phage display libraries are widely used to both discover novel antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies and also to epitope map existing antibodies [12,13]. However, while phage-display technology for studying antibody responses have been present for several decades, it has often been plagued by several common issues. For example, phage display libraries are often created using random n-mers [14] or cDNA products [15,16], which when created from the target tissue through random priming leads to ORFs of various lengths or premature stop codons [17]. Furthermore, earlier phage display technologies utilize the M13 lysogenic phage display system, which requires antigenic phages to be translocated across the periplasmic membrane, thereby introducing bias against certain amino acid peptide sequences [18]. Fortunately, advances in molecular technologies (such as microarray-based DNA synthesis and high throughput sequencing) and the use of T7 bacteriophage has enabled PhIP-Seq to overcome these challenges [9].",

            "text": "They successfully displayed antibody variable regions on phages by using immunoglobulin variable genes of hybridomas and B cells. Since then, phage display technology has been extensively used for the discovery of antibodies or peptides against a large variety of antigens in many fields of application such as toxiconology (Ledsgaard et al., 2018), drug discovery (Erdag et al., 2007;Mimmi et al., 2019), immunization (Bahad\u0131r et al., 2011), epitope mapping (Folgori et al., 1994) and virus or toxin neutralization (Lim et al., 2019) by using phage peptide and antibody libraries. \n\nAntibody libraries have been displayed on phages in very different antibody formats. The main ones consist of Fab domain of antibodies, single chain Fv (scFv) which is the linear form of the variable domain of heavy and light chains, and single domain antibodies (nanobodies). The latter includes camelid VH domain and shark vNAR (new antigen receptor) domain (Cheong et al., 2020). There are 4 types of antibody phage libraries, naive library, semisynthetic, synthetic and immune libraries (Carmen and Jermutus, 2002). Naive libraries are generated from the natural antibody repertoire of donors or nonimmunized animals. Semisynthetic and synthetic libraries are generated from low diversity natural antibody repertoires by increasing the diversity with mutations in the CDR (complementarity determining region). Lastly, the immune library is generated from the antibody repertoire of immunized animals (Erdag et al., 2011) or diseased or vaccinated humans (Omar and Lim, 2018). The selection of a target specific antibody from the phage libraries is made with a method called biopanning or affinity selection. The method consists of exposing the antibody phage library to the target antigen which is immobilized on a solid surface. The phages displaying antibodies specific to the target, bind to the antigen and the nonbinders are washed away from the media. Then the target specific phages are recovered by elution for a phage amplification step by infecting fresh bacterial cells.",

            "text": "Phage display technology, invented by George P. Smith in 1985 to display peptides (59), was later adapted in 1990 to display the antibody fragments on phage (60). Since then, the technology has successfully facilitated the discovery of hundreds of antibodies for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications, including more than 17 clinically approved antibodies (38,61). Compared with other display technologies, such as yeast and mammalian display, one of the advantages of phage display is the ability to create large libraries with diversities of up to 10 11 unique clones. Robust in vitro phage selection procedures have been developed, allowing selection on a variety of antigen sources [e.g. protein, peptide, cells, virus-like particles (VLPs), nanodiscs, liposomesreviewed elsewhere (39)] to identify molecules with specificity to desired epitopes, including the use of sophisticated FACS-based selections on phage to identify rare antibodies against challenging targets (62). Phage display typically uses filamentous bacteriophage M13 of E. coli and can be exploited to express various antibody formats. Antibody fragments are usually fused to the minor coat protein encoded by gene 3 (pIII), present at 3-5 copies per phage. In the early phage systems, the pIII fusion was created in the phage genome (60). To enable the construction of large libraries, a phagemid system is more commonly used, where the Ab-pIII fusion is encoded on a plasmid bearing a phage single-stranded origin of replication (63)(64)(65). The assembly of phage particles is then facilitated by co-infection of E. coli with helper phage to provide all crucial components for M13 phage packaging. Due to the competition between pIII from the helper phage and the phagemid encoded Ab-pIII fusion, display levels are typically low (e.g., 10% of phage displaying a single copy). To overcome this, a helper phage lacking gene 3 (\"Hyperphage\") has been created to increase display levels and enable avidity-based selections (66, 67) [reviewed elsewhere (39,68)].",

            "text": "In addition, clone enrichment can also reflect features not necessarily related to target affinity, including biological fitness and binding to non-target substrates (discussed in the next sections) reducing the isolation of true binders [52]. \n\nThe application of NGS to antibody display technologies (such as phage display, E. coli display, yeast display, ribosome display) allows us to deeply characterize the library composition, exploiting the physical linkage between phenotype (peptide or scFv protein) and genotype (coding sequence) of each phage genome present in the phage pool (Figure 2) [53,54]. Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.",

            "text": "In the last decades, numerous combinatorial methodologies for the selection and screening of proteins were developed, which mimic natural evolutionary processes in vitro and aim at detecting interaction partners with specific chemical and/or physical properties. Among these, surface display technologies play a central role and besides bacterial, ribosomal, yeast and other screening methods, phage display is by far the most widespread application for screening of protein interaction partners or selecting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [76]. \n\nWith the latest developments discussed here, the presentation of cDNA and ORF expression products on phage has become not only possible, but led to an increase in library quality, produced indepth analysis of the enrichment process, became faster, more convenient and reasonably priced. Thus the application of this approach and variations thereof will increase constantly in the future. Most application areas described in this review centre around the identification of novel allergens, potential biomarkers in autoimmune disorders [43,77], cancer [78,79] or vaccine development [80]. However, additional fields of application, such as screening for cellular targets of toxic chemical compounds emerge [81]. \n\nThe next level of phage display will indisputably see the implementation of NGS into automation strategies for screening of combinatorial libraries [82]. The application of semi-automated selection strategies, such as developed in our laboratory [83,84] not only allows the reduction of variability and increased reproducibility of the selection protocol, but can be readily implemented in process pipelines based on unit-automation [85,86]. Such pipelines, in turn, can be easily extended to include NGS as a sophisticated analysis tool of the selection outcome. \n\nTwenty-five years after its introduction, phage display persists to be the most popular and successful surface display application with more than 4,000 entries in PubMed. With the latest developments in library design and the combination of phage display with high-throughput selection pipelines and next generation sequencing, the field has become as vibrant as ever.",

[22] nclusion: We characterize discovery trajectories in phage-displayed libraries built on M13KE genome with well-characterized bias. Simple replacement of BA with EmA yields three major outcomes: (i) EmA-selection steers the selections away from the pre-defined parasite populations; (ii) Steering away from the \"parasite\" population discovers ligands from the regions of the library not accessible to parasite-biased BA-screens; (ii) most remarkably, EmA-selection from independently produced libraries L 1 and L 2 with two distinct P 1 and P 2 sets reproducibly converges on the same sequences. In contract BA-selections of same libraries L 1 and L 2 diverge to P 1 and P 2 sets. Convergence of discoveries from relatively small peptide libraries of <10 9 is anticipated and we identify the circumstances in which convergence is maximized. Maximizing the reproducibility of discovery between different instances of production or selection of the same library will be critical for effecting communication of discovery observations between different researchers. Not every library is \"stirred\" by EmA: in large 10 11 -scale antibody libraries, in which bias towards \"parasite population\" was not detectable, EmA had no detectable effect either. 18a] EmA or other technologies that remove growth bias will be critical in ensuring the reproducibility of discovery from GE-libraries.",

            "text": "Identifying antibodies with high affinity and target specificity is crucial for drug discovery and development; however, filtering out antibody candidates with nonspecific or polyspecific binding profiles is also important. In this issue of Cell Reports Methods, Saksena et al. report a computational counterselection method combining deep sequencing and machine learning for identifying nonspecific antibody candidates and demonstrate that it has advantages over more established molecular counterselection methods. \n\nTraditional antibody discovery processes make heavy use of screening platforms, such as phage, yeast, and mammalian display technologies (Parola et al., 2018). These methods link the phenotype and genotype of proteins displayed and allow for rapid selection of large libraries of proteins including antibodies and antibody fragments. For phage display, the platform used in Saksena et al. (2022), the most common type of antibody fragments displayed are single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). Till now, phage display libraries with diversities up to 10 11 sequences have been constructed and used extensively for antibody drug discovery. Traditional discovery by display platforms consist of performing several rounds of selection against target antigens, resulting in a pool of antigenspecific clones that then undergo additional experimental characterization and possibly follow-up engineering (e.g., affinity maturation) to select for therapeutic lead candidates. \n\nIn addition to high affinity to the target, a critical property for any antibody drug candidate is having minimal off-target binding. However, antibodies with offtarget binding may also become enriched and selected through a screening process such as phage display. These polyspecific or nonspecific antibodies have the capacity to bind unrelated antigens and are often linked to non-ideal pharmacokinetic profiles (Ho \u00a8tzel et al., 2012). There has been evidence that suggests nonspecific antibody sequences can be identified through shared features. For example, the VH6 germline family was identified as a source of nonspecific clones derived from a yeast-displayed naive human antibody library (Kelly et al., 2017). Additionally, certain physicochemical properties of amino acids in antibody variable regions have been found to be associated with nonspecific binding (Zhang et al., 2020).",

While antibodies with mediocre affinities are readily screened from relatively small nai \u0308ve or synthetic libraries, in general, for isolating high-affinity binders, the diversity of the library becomes significant. 9 In fact, studies have shown a linear correlation between the library size in terms of diversity and the highest affinity that has been isolated, meaning that, in particular, in the case of nai \u0308ve or synthetic libraries, the size of the library must be large enough to increase the probability of finding a given antibody and enhance the quality of the antibody. 50 ther Functional Domains and Scaffolds. Phage display technology also offers a means to explore other nonantibody protein binders. Functional protein domains refer to short polypeptide chains that are capable of creating a threedimensional structure required for a defined functional activity. 5 For example, affibodies are engineered single-domain proteins, in which a functional scaffold has been derived from protein A. 51 Affibody molecule libraries have been constructed by combinatorial randomization of the amino acids in the scaffold and used to select binders by phage display. 52,53 Other binding scaffolds include, for example, anticalins, 54,55 DAR-Pins, 56 knottins, 57 atrimers, and fynomers, 58 which all can be selected using phage display, although these binders have been less used in biosensing applications.",

            "text": "Perspective have been successfully applied to screen antibody libraries. Although less popular than phage display technology, these methods present some advantages, such as the ability of yeast cells to express complex proteins that require post-translational modifications or the possibility to create larger libraries using cell-free methods that are not restricted by the bacterial transformation efficiency. 64 he process of in vitro affinity selection, whether it is based on phage or other display systems, commonly includes (I) the generation of genotypic diversity by constructing protein or peptide libraries that consist of millions or billions of different variants; (II) the display method that creates a physical link between the expressed protein variant and the gene coding for it; (III) the application of selective pressure to screen for target-specific binders, and, finally, (IV) the amplification of the selected variants. 9 \u221267 These systems provide immediately the genes and corresponding DNA sequences of the clones selected against the specific target. Simple subcloning can allow presenting modifications or adding functionalities, such as purification tags or fusions to enzymes or fluorescent proteins. 65 Moreover, also conventionally challenging targets, such as toxic or nonimmunogenic molecules, have been successfully used. 68,69 he screening process of phage-displayed libraries, commonly known as panning, includes introducing the phagedisplayed library to the target captured to a solid surface, washing to remove the unbound and nonspecifically bound phages, elution of the bound phages, and amplification of the eluted phages through bacterial infection (Figure 2A). Ideally, only one round of selection is required, but as nonspecific binding limits the enrichment in one selection round, in most cases, three to five iterative rounds of selection and amplification are performed to select individual binders. \n\nA variety of modifications in the panning protocol and details for improved selections have been described for the identification of high-affinity binders from phage-displayed libraries. Generally, the experiment can be designed to maximize either phage capture or affinity discrimination. While effective capture is best used for the first selection round, the conditions can be modified in the later rounds to produce better affinity discrimination. 5",

            "text": "Phage display has shown enormous promise in ligand identification and heralded new advances in the discovery of peptides with diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, it is likely that challenges will be met on the ligand discovery road using phage display. Differentiating genuine target binders and false positives is a crucial step in enhancing the integrity of phage display selections. Our findings exemplify the importance of reporting not only successful phage display selections but also biopanning experiments where the isolated peptides fail to bind to the target of interest. Also, our study highlights the importance of trying to explore the reasons behind the observed failure, as it can help advance the understanding of the selection process and optimize the phage display protocols. Choosing suitable phage display libraries, using appropriate selection conditions (balanced stringency), validating downstream assays, and applying proper controls in both the selection process and downstream characterization are all determining factors that impact the quality of the peptides identified in phage display selections. More importantly, the sequencing strategy used for analyzing the results of selection and choosing candidate peptides for downstream binding characterization plays a major role in troubleshooting the selection process and improving the identification of promising hits. In this context, NGS can overcome some of the bottlenecks associated with the commonly used Sanger sequencing approach and avoid misidentification of the nonspecifically enriched TUPs. We believe that counterculture reports, like the current study, can make a significant contribution to our deeper understanding of the anatomy of the fall and rise of a phage display library selection. Beyond doubt, the constructive debates ignited by such reports that are born from less-than-optimal results can be eye-openers for phage display scientists. Based on this, we hope that our work will shine light on some of the less-discoursed aspects of phage display in peptide discovery.",

            "text": "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets.",

            "text": "Universal antibody phage display libraries, typically consisting of over ten billion unique sequences, have become a valuable source for discovery of mAbs against any types of targets. According to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library. By using mono-or trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIM technology) as building blocks, 84,85 diversified CDRs can be synthesized in a high-throughput manner, such as array-based oligonucleotide synthesis and Slonomics. 86,87 In the TRIM technology, each amino acid is encoded by a defined codon. Therefore, amino acid distribution at the desired position can be precisely defined. Moreover, because the codon for each amino acid is selected for optimal antibody expression, the functional library size is increased. In the natural antibody repertoire, the diversity of CDRs, except CDRH3, is a collection of defined sequences that exhibit canonical structures. Compared with the traditional column-based DNA synthesis approaches in which one single gene is produced per column, the high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies allow parallel synthesis of a large number of predetermined sequences in the same footprint on a silicon-based chip. 88,89 This enables not only removal of liability motifs that impact developability, but also precise mimic of the",

In general, phagemid vectors are preferred because cloning is more straightforward and they are more stable. However, whereas display using phage is multivalent (up to 5 copies), that with phagemids is monovalent, with only 1% of phagemid particles actually displaying antibodies. 25 Although new approaches for generation of phage(mid) antibody libraries, such as monodisperse emulsion, 26 have been described, production is usually carried out in shake flasks, with the obtained phage titer from one 2.5 L flask sufficient for approximately 50 selections. Recently, a number of high throughput antibody selection platforms based on phage display have been described, [27][28][29][30][31] where selections are carried out against numerous different antigens in parallel.

            "text": "In 1985, Smith et al. demonstrated phage display technology using artificial peptide sequences on the N-terminus of a bacteriophage surface protein [1].Phage display technology allows the construction of libraries in which various peptides and proteins are displayed on the phages, and then the most suitable clone is selected from the library by in vitro panning.Therefore, the clones with an affinity for the target of interest or those with the ability to migrate to the target tissue are enriched from the library.Therefore, the development of phage display technology provides optimal sequences to target peptides or proteins, unlike conventional alanine scanning and other methods, and aids understanding of their molecular evolution [2][3][4][5][6][7].Although various kinds of molecular display technologies such as ribosome display [8,9], and yeast display technologies [10,11] have been proposed, phage display technology is frequently employed because of a high diversity of molecules that can be displayed and ease of handling [12,13].\n\nIn particular, phage display technology has become a powerful platform for drug discovery in life science because it is easy to produce antibodies in vitro.Winter et al. displayed a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody that consists of the variable heavy chain (VH) and the variable light chain (VL) joined together by a flexible peptide linker in 1990 [14].Subsequently, several antibody formats, such as scFv, fragment antigenbinding (Fab), and variable fragment (VHH) derived from heavy chain antibodies of Camelidae, have been reported to be displayed on the phages (Figure 1).Therefore, the phage display technology allows the construction of various phage antibody libraries such as na\u00efve [15,16], immunized [17,18] and synthetic phage antibody [19,20] and contributes to the current development of antibody drugs.More than 70 phage-derived monoclonal antibodies have entered clinical studies, and 14 of them have been approved for use till May 2020.Here, we review the importance of phage display technology as a powerful platform for drug discovery, from target discovery to antibody drug development.\n\nThree frequently used antibody formats (scFv, Fab and VHH) are shown.",

            "text": "Individual clones from each library and selection target were then grown in a 96-well format in 400 l of 2YT medium supplemented with carbenicillin and KO7 helper phage. Phage ELISA assays (29) were performed to detect phage-displayed variants of BCMA ECD capable of binding BAFF, APRIL, or anti-tag antibody. All clones tested that were found to be positive in their respective ELISAs were then sequenced as described previously (30). Sequences of acceptable quality were translated and aligned. For selection of binding to BAFF, 40 and 47 sequences were analyzed for libraries 1 and 2, respectively. For selection of binding to APRIL, 44 and 46 sequences were analyzed from libraries 1 and 2, respectively. For the display selection, binding to anti-tag antibody, a minimum of 40 sequences were analyzed for each library. To quantify the effect of each mutation on ligand binding, normalized frequency ratios (F) for each amino acid position were calculated from a ratio of ligand selection to display efficiency selection, as described previously (31). \n\nNNS Library Construction and Sorting-The BCMA2-g3 phagemid was used to prepare a library having complete randomization (NNS degenerate codon as defined by IUB code ( 23)) of residues Leu 18 , Ile 22 , Gln 25 , and Arg 27 . The library contained 1 \u03eb 10 10 phage/ml, allowing complete representation of the library, theoretically 1 \u03eb 10 6 unique members. This library was sorted as described for the shotgun alanine libraries. Since each amino acid position selected for NNS codon introduction has the potential of all 20 amino acids from 31 triplet codons, the data are weighed according to codon degeneracy by calculating the ratio of percentage of occurrence to percentage of degeneracy of the amino acid at a given position as suggested previously (32). The normalized F\u0408 value is the percentage of occurrence to percentage of degeneracy ratio for ligand selection divided by the percentage of occurrence to percentage of degeneracy ratio for display efficiency.",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, in vitro selection technologies have matured as effective alternatives to animal immunization for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since the first description that antibody fragments can be expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and selected for specific binding to a target, phage display has become one of the most widely used in vitro approaches for the generation of antibodies for research and therapeutic applications [1,2]. More recently, the display of antibodies at the surface of yeast or mammalian cells, as well as cell free systems, such as ribosome display, have complemented the panel of technologies available for the isolation and engineering of antibodies and other protein scaffolds [3,4]. Regardless of the display package used for in vitro isolation of antibodies, a collection of diversified genes encoding antibody variable regions has to be generated. The diversity and quality of such an antibody gene library is of critical importance for success and the correlation between the number and affinity of antibodies that can be isolated and the library size has been demonstrated [5]. Thus, there has been significant effort to assemble very large antibody libraries, i.e., comprising between 10 8 and >10 11 members, so that, in principle, antibodies against any antigen can be identified [6][7][8]. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed either by capturing naturally rearranged immunoglobulin genes isolated from B cells or using synthetic approaches relying on mutagenesis of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described [9]. In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen [10,11]. In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher.",

            "text": "In vitro evolution and selection of genetic libraries is central to molecular biology research. In drug discovery, the selection of lead compounds from random genetically encoded libraries complements rational drug design. Many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antibodies and peptides on the market have originated from selection and evolution experiments (1,2). Selection from genetically encoded libraries is finding increasing utility in areas such as the development of new chemicals, the design of new materials and the discovery of new chemical reactions (3)(4)(5). Screening experiments-such as phage display (6,7), nucleotide display, cell display, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) and DNA aptamer selection (8,9)-use libraries with a diversity of >10 9 unique sequences, which are then narrowed to 10 2 -10 6 useful library members. In a screen that aims to identify binding sequences for a specific target, selection increases the abundances of sequences that have high binding capacity. Sequencing of clones enriched during in vitro selection is often used to analyze the selection preferences and the enrichment for sequence motif(s). Collapse of the na\u0131\u00a8ve library to a collection of a few sequences indicates that selection narrowed onto clones that bind to a target ( Figure 1A). While most screens exhibit convergence to one sequence motif, screens against the surfaces of cells or tissues (10)(11)(12), mixtures of antibodies (13)(14)(15)(16) or other proteins, could converge on multiple binding epitopes. The screens against such 'multisite targets' could yield information about multiple ligands for multiple receptors on the cell (10,11). In recent years, deep sequencing approaches have been used to assist the analysis of phage-displayed selection (17), and in many cases, the selection against multisite targets (18)(19)(20). Our group used deep sequencing to detect convergence, which occurs in the phage display screens without any selection ( Figure 1B). We amplified 10 6 sequences from a na\u0131\u00a8ve library in bacteria, and observed that amplification alone enriched a few hundred motifs by 10-100-fold and depressed the remaining 10 6 motifs (21). This experiment, for the first time quantified the collapse of the",

            "text": "Various AI tools and platforms can be involved in different stages of this process. Szymczak et al. present an interesting and exhaustive analysis of the AI methods that could support AMP discovery and design, discussing different categories of AI methodologies and focusing on the recent achievements in AI-driven AMP discovery [35]. Since the de novo design of antimicrobial peptides is a complex task, a multidisciplinary approach involving expertise in biology, chemistry and bioinformatics is essential for success [36]. \n\nA completely different way to identify new sequences is the phage display technique. Phage display is a highly effective and robust technology used to identify ligands of biological targets, first reported by Smith in 1985 [37]. Phage display is a selection technique in which a library of peptide or protein variants is expressed on the outside of a phage virion (i.e., M13 phage), while the genetic material encoding the variants resides on the inside. This creates a physical link between variant protein sequences and the DNA encoding them, which allows rapid partitioning based on binding affinity to target molecules (antibodies, enzymes, cell-surface receptors, etc.) by an in vitro selection process called panning. Briefly, panning is carried out by incubating a library of phage-displayed peptides with the target, washing away the unbound phages, and eluting the specifically bound phages. The eluted phages are then amplified and taken through additional binding/amplification cycles to enrich the pool in favour of binding sequences. After 3-4 rounds, individual clones are characterised by DNA-sequencing and -binding assays. This technique has allowed the discovery of several new peptide candidates [38].",

The primers should allow efficient amplification of all commonly used V-gene segments. Further, to obtain large sized libraries (over 10 10 in diversity), we used a two-step cloning procedure; heavy and light chain variable genes were first separately cloned as digested PCR products, and then combined by restriction fragment cloning to form a large library of Fab fragments. This cloning procedure should be a more efficient route for library construction than the relatively inefficient direct cloning of digested PCR products, while avoiding the DNA instability often associated with in vivo recombination systems (35). \n\nAs choice of antibody format, we preferred the Fab above the scFv format, because this would allow us to develop rapid high through-put affinity-screening assays for crude antibody preparations. Many scFv fragments indeed form higher molecular weight species including dimers (20,21) and trimers (36), which complicate both selection and characterization. We chose the Fab display format, in which the heavy chain is linked to the phage coat protein pIII, and also carries a tag for detection and purification (see below). The light chain is expressed as separate fragment, secreted into the periplasm, where it can pair with the heavy chain (37).",

They created combinatorial antibody libraries on filamentous phage to be utilized for generating antigen specific antibodies in a matter of weeks. Since then, more than 70 phage\u2013derived antibodies entered clinical studies and 14 of them have been approved. These antibodies are indicated for cancer, and non-cancer medical conditions, such as inflammatory, optical, infectious, or immunological diseases.

            "text": "Monovalent and polyvalent phage display are commonly implemented by switching the type of helper phage. Monovalent display is crucial for the selection of highaffinity antibodies, whereas polyvalent display provides avidity. The efficiency of monovalent SpyDisplay for the selection of high-affinity antibodies is demonstrated by the selection of antibodies in the low pM range in our test pannings. As for regular phage display, use of Hyperphage enables polyvalent SpyDisplay and indeed showed high display rates. Phage titers were lower than for monovalent SpyDisplay yet still adequate for panning with standard library sizes. We envision that, in the context of Fab library panning, polyvalent SpyDisplay will facilitate the selection of antibodies against challenging targets like carbohydrates. 30 Affinities of such antibodies can later be improved by an optional affinity maturation process. \n\nWe have shown that the displayed antibody and the anchoring SpyCatcher-pIII protein, which are translated independently of each other, form a fusion protein exclusively in the periplasm. Optimized periplasmic secretion signal peptides for each polypeptide chain can be used. In this implementation of antibody SpyDisplay, three different signal peptides are used: OmpA and PhoA for light and heavy antibody chains, and DsbA for the SpyCatcher-pIII fusion. Furthermore, we showed that the TAT pathway is compatible with SpyDisplay, enabling the cytoplasmic folding of the displayed proteins. The display rate via the TAT pathway could potentially be increased through optimization of the TAT signal peptide. We anticipate that TAT-based display will be useful for selecting intrabodies, antibodies that can fold in the cytoplasm, without the need for specialized intrabody libraries. \n\nMazor et al. also achieved a separation of the expression of antibody and coat protein by forming a complex between an IgG and Fc-binding ZZ-domain-pIII fusion. 30 Similarly, the Jun/Fos leucine zipper has been used to link the displayed protein to pIII. 31 Since these methods are non-covalent, the complex might dissociate during stringent washing steps required for the selection of high-affinity antibodies.",

            "text": "Technologies to generate replenishable sources of target-specific antibodies have revolutionized biomedical research and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Hybridoma technology (1) is a highly effective and well-established method to generate murine monoclonal antibodies, and is still widely used to produce antibodies for a variety of applications, including therapeutic antibodies. More recently, in vitro methods have been developed to generate target-specific antibodies. Most notably, the development of in vitro display technologies (2) such as phage display, has enabled rapid isolation of target-specific antibodies from large antibody libraries. Advantages of the in vitro display methods include the speed and ease of antibody generation, the ability to control various selection parameters, and the ability to generate fully human antibodies for therapeutic development. Consequently, high-affinity, high-specificity antibodies suitable for demanding applications can readily be produced and engineered by these technologies, and phage display is now a major technical platform to generate therapeutic antibody candidates. \n\nThe success of in vitro antibody generation depends largely upon the quality and the size of the antibody library. In case of phage and yeast display libraries (the two most widely used methods), the size of a library is simply determined by the efficiency of host cell transformation. On the other hand, a lot of different factors can influence the quality of a library. This is especially true for the synthetic antibody libraries (Table 1); unlike natural antibody libraries (3)(4)(5)(6)(7) which are constructed by PCR-amplification of V(D)J-rearranged immunoglobulin genes from B-cell cDNA and thus do not require human input during the generation of sequence diversity, the strategy for the sequence diversification is necessary, and indeed critical, for the construction of synthetic antibody libraries. Most of the existing synthetic antibody libraries have their sequence diversity concentrated in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), and generated by random combinations of mono-or trinucleotide units (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). The CDRs of a synthetic antibody library need to be designed so that the resulting library is enriched with diverse, yet nature-like sequences, which are stable and highly expressed in host cells.",

Mutagenic oligonucleotides listed in Table 1, designed to simultaneously repair the stop codons and introduce mutations at the desired sites in the stop template, were used in the mutagenesis. Mutations were introduced simultaneously into CDR-L3 and CDR-H3, and possibly CDR-H1 or CDR-H2.

            "text": "For discovery of therapeutic antibodies through phage display technology, antibodies against a target, such as a protein or a cell, are enriched through consecutive selection rounds. This often results in a large phage pool consisting of antibody sequences of both high and low frequency (Yang et al., 2017). Direct screening, where only a sub-fraction of the antibody diversity is subjected to testing, mainly identifies the most abundant antibodies and, when whole cells are used as target, subsequently their corresponding specificities. As the antibody frequency is not related to functionality, there is a need to facilitate discovery also of low-abundant antibodies and thus find additional antibodies and, when applicable, additional specificities. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated four deep mining strategies to facilitate discovery of low abundant clones, using a phage pool previously generated by panning on a complex target, whole cells (Ljungars et al., 2018). From this pool, a diversity of binders with a handful of different specificities had been found through a direct screening approach (Ljungars et al., 2018). Yet the present study demonstrated that there were additional antibodies of different specificities to be found, at low frequency, as such antibodies could be enriched following selection on recombinant antigen. Additional deep mining strategies were used to identify rare clones that bind, for this phage pool, previously undiscovered targets and epitopes. These strategies can be used to unlock the full potential of phage pools generated through panning on cells. \n\nTo reduce the frequency of already discovered antibodies and specificities, we applied an antibody blocking strategy where the previously generated phage pool underwent panning on whole cells in the presence of 241 previously discovered antibodies specific for six different receptors. Antibodies against new epitopes on the target cells were successfully enriched and subsequently discovered. This is in agreement with previous studies where antibodies against new epitopes on a single target protein (Ditzel et al., 1995;Ditzel, 2002;Tsui et al., 2002), a cell lysate (Sanna et al., 1995), or whole cells (Even-Desrumeaux et al., 2014) have been found through a blocking strategy.",

In order to maximize the functional diversity of the library, a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy was employed in which the assembled scFv gene repertoire was fused to the 5\u2032-end of the \u03b2-lactamase gene, and in-frame scFv clones were enriched by carbenicillin selection. A final library with an estimated total diversity of 7.6 \u00d7 109, greater than 70% functional diversity, and diversification of all six CDRs was obtained after insertion of fully randomized CDR-H3 sequences into this proofread repertoire. The performance of the library was validated using a number of target antigens, against which multiple unique scFv sequences with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range were isolated.",

            "text": "Also, during the construction of complex antibody libraries, PCR is employed at multiple steps. PCR generated errors result in a large number of cloned antibody fragments either having stop codons or out of frame mutations, thus reducing the quality of the libraries. Consequently, large libraries with several million to billion clones are constructed; however, the effective functional population of in-frame clones in these libraries is only 5-6%. Further, when used for affinity selection, these libraries suffer from non-specific interactions leading to poor enrichment of desired clones [11]. The success of selection of specific interactions can be remarkably increased if the quality of input library is improved. \n\nElimination of out-of-frame clones to enrich the libraries for ORF clones is a step in this direction. \n\nDifferent systems have been developed for the selection of gene fragments in the correct reading frame and construct ORFselected phage display libraries. In one system, the gene fragments are cloned between the signal sequence and the coding sequence of b-lactamase, so that only in-frame fragments result in expression of functional b-lactamase to impart ampicillin resistance [12]. However, after selection, these putative in-frame fragments need to be transferred to a phage display vector by cloning [11] or the coding sequence of b-lactamase must be deleted by Cre-Lox recombination [12,13] to produce a signal sequence in-frame with gIIIP for display of the cloned gene fragments. In another system, hyperphage (a helper phage with DgIII) has also been used to enrich clones which carry in-frame DNA inserts [14]. However, the phage titres produced by hyperphage are much lower than those produced using VCSM13 helper phage. Furthermore, when applied to the selection of ORFs in a genome scale library, 69% of the clones were in-frame, but the average size distribution of the selected library decreased to 50-300 bp, compared to 50-700 bp for the originally cloned DNA fragments [15]. \n\nIn this paper, we describe the design of a novel helper phage, AGM13, which carries two copies of trypsin cleavage sites in the linker domains of gIIIP.",

            "text": "The phage display methodology has been shown to be a valuable, robust, and efficient platform to discover and develop human therapeutic antibodies. Until recently, however, the commercial use of phage display was limited to a few companies holding their technology patents [16]. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, the libraries listed in Table 1 are not available for research purposes. Nevertheless, most of the patents covering phage display have expired in Europe and the United States [16], offering a great opportunity to freely use phage display. As this methodology is becoming a commodity, several companies are licensing phage display antibody libraries such as ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 (https://www.globalbioinc.com/Services/). Also, Bio-Rad Laboratories is offering discovery services based on HuCAL PLATINUM (https://www.bio-rad-antibodies.com/hucal-ordering-information.html) at a relatively low cost. On the other hand, a number of phage display antibody libraries generated before 2010 (not reviewed here but widely validated) are available to academic laboratories at The University of Cambridge or the Scottish Biologics Facility (https://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbf/about/sbf-libraries/). These libraries include the synthetic antibody libraries known as Tomlinson's libraries [86], built at the UK Medical Research Council and a human na\u00efve library of over 10 10 human antibodies generated by John McCafferty and his colleagues. Tomlinson's synthetic libraries have produced specific and high affinity antibodies for a number of targets [87,88], whereas McCafferty's na\u00efve library has been used to select, screen, and sequence around 38,000 recombinant antibodies against almost 300 antigens. \n\nRegarding opportunities for improving current libraries, an ideal antibody library should generate diverse, highly specific, and high affinity antibodies, as well as developable molecules with a minimum of effort, i.e., only two to three rounds of panning. An important parameter and perhaps the simplest one to be considered when building an antibody phage display library is its size, as it correlates with the probability of selecting higher affinity antibodies, as predicted by Perelson [34].",

            "text": "In one comparative study, antibodies cloned from mice immunized with human interleukin-5 protein using phage display and hybridoma methods were compared (Ames et al. 1995). Each method produced a structurally distinct group of antibodies, and only the antibodies cloned by the hybridoma method were able to block binding of the cytokine with its receptor. Ohlin and Borrebaeck (1996) analyzed a dataset of cloned antibody sequences specific for infectious disease antigens, the majority of which were viral, and were cloned by either the phage display or hybridoma method (Ohlin and Borrebaeck 1996). They noted substantial differences in the heavy chain and light chain gene family utilization between antibodies derived from the two different sources. They also noted a dramatic limitation of the diversity of the light chain gene repertoire. This observation may have been due to the phenomenon of light chain promiscuity, i.e., the ability of heavy chains to productively associate with a variety of light chains (Kang et al. 1991). \n\nThe ability of a phage library to recreate native heavy chain:light chain combinations was recently assessed by comparing a phage display antibody library that maintained native pairings with one made from the same cDNA that did not (Meijer et al. 2006). In the random library, the assortment of heavy chain and light chain sequences had apparently lost a majority of the original heavy chain:light chain pairings. Consistent with the principle of light chain promiscuity, the diversity of the random library was less than the nonrandom library due to an over-representation of VH chains capable of associating with many different light chain sequences. The functional importance of the antibody repertoire shift in the random library was revealed by the overall lower affinity of antibodies specific for tetanus toxoid (TT) antibodies cloned from the two libraries. \n\nTaken together, these experiments illustrate the concept that intrinsic biases in phage display libraries may prevent some important native antibody structures from being incorporated into them. B cell immortalization methods of human antibody cloning are therefore complementary to recombinant DNA methods and thus merit further study and optimization.",

            "text": "The method described here enables the target-agnostic generation of a large panel of antibodies to a broad range of differentially expressed antigens. In this study, we used the phage display library n-CoDeR to generate antibodies targeting the cancer cell line DU145. While the method should be applicable to other libraries, some parameters, such as mean affinity and the number of copies of individual antibodies in the unselected library, will have to be adjusted. Further, while additional sources of complex targets can be screened, it is important that the target and nontarget populations stay consistent throughout the selections. If liquid samples such as blood are used, the method used to capture soluble components must be reproducible. The inclusion of reference targets with known expressions in target and nontarget samples can be used to ensure proper modeling. While the method helps design display selections and guide the discovery of antibodies with the desired specificity, enrichment signatures of individual antibody clones may deviate from those modeled due to, e.g., varying affinity, target epitope immunogenicity, and phage amplification in bacteria.",

            "title": "High Affinity, Developability and Functional Size: The Holy Grail of Combinatorial Antibody Library Generation",
            "text": "Four types of antibody libraries can be distinguished with respect to the source of library sequences: Immune, na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries (Figure 2). While the first two are based entirely on naturally occurring sequence diversity, synthetic libraries are diversified according to design. Semi-synthetic libraries combine natural diversity for certain aspects of the library with in silico design. Although the combinatorial aspect is most prominent in semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries, na\u00efve and immune libraries also feature certain combinatorial aspects, e.g. the random pairing of heavy and light chains. For representative examples of different phage display libraries please refer to Table 1. \n\nGeneration of large functional libraries is limited by transformation/transfection efficiency and the occurrence of frame shift mutants leading to non functional proteins. The cloning of large antibody libraries is therefore technically challenging, laborious and time consuming. The principle of in vivo recombination of the light and heavy chain gene of an antibody was first described by the group of Greg Winter as a means to increase library size [65]. A Cre/loxP two vector system was used, with a donor plasmid vector encoding the heavy chain and an acceptor fd phage vector encoding the light chain. Both heavy as well as light chain gene are flanked by loxP sites leading to a site-specific recombination in vivo. By-passing the limitation of transformation efficiency with infection, this system allows the generation of very large libraries. Griffiths and coworkers used this system to generate a phage display library of 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . Sblattero and Bradbury used a modified version where both the heavy and light chain V-genes were located on the same phagemid separated by a loxP site. Starting out with a relatively small initial library with a size of 7 \u00d7 10 7 they were able to generate a library of 3 \u00d7 10 11 in vivo by site-specific recombination [66]. Another important aspect is functional library size, which is limited by the occurrence of deletion mutants caused by frameshifts or stop codons introduced during diversification. Tremendous progress has been made by construction of vector systems comprising a positive selection for protein integrity.",

            "text": "The first synthetic library was constructed by Marks et al. (1991). For this purpose, a repertoire of human VH genes from 49 human germline VH-gene segments in vitro rearranged was developed to create a synthetic CDR3 of five to eight residues. For phage display, rearranged VH genes were cloned with a human V\u03bb3 light chain as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). The selection resulted in the isolation of many antibodies against haptens and one against a protein antigen. These great results were part of the first proof of concept for synthetic antibodies. Thereafter, to cover the natural length diversity of the loop of the CDR3, the diversity was expanded from 4 to 12 residues (Nissim et al., 1994). The success of the expanded library showed the importance of diversity in a longer CDR-H3 loop. To improve the synthetically rearranged VH gene repertoire of Nissim et al. (1994) and Griffiths et al.

In this study, 26 human germline Vk and 21 germline V\u03bb segments were assembled into complete V genes using PCR with CDR3 loops partially randomized to mimic the diversity generated by V-J gene recombination in vivo. In order to create a large synthetic repertoire of Fab fragments displayed on a filamentous phage, the heavy and light-chain V-gene repertoires were combined on a phage vector in bacteria using the lox-Cresite-specific-recombination system. This resulted in the development of antibodies with affinities similar to those obtained from a secondary immune response in mice (Griffiths et al., 1994). A summary of some of the phage display antibody libraries used in the discovery of therapeutic antibodies is shown in Table 1.",

            "text": "The ability to identify coding sequences within a genomic interval using a proteomic approach is important to complement current genome-protein strategies that rely solely upon DNA sequence information. Coupling epitope display libraries from human genomic regions with antibody selection for expressed epitopes has the potential to enrich for library members with coding (exon) sequences. A phage display library containing the full human genome sequence could be an invaluable tool for human protein-protein interaction identification. Some variables to consider in construction of such a complete library include the DNA sequence space to be covered (3r10 9 bp human genome), the insert size (e.g., 100-300 bp exon size), number of partial overlapping inserts desired (diversity), and functional peptide display due to stop codon effects on display. For example, the absolute minimum number of members in a library of the human genome composed of 150 bp inserts would be about 2r10 7 members (3r10 9 bp/150 bp); however, 90% of these would not display peptides due to stop codons in genomic sequence. Thus, it's desirable to generate a library of at least two magnitudes greater size (>10 9 members). A library with large diversity favors potential binders; however, large libraries are difficult to construct. A practical limitation is the efficiency of transforming bacteria with plasmid,  To determine the utility of using a human genomic library approach to select coding regions, an epitope phage display library was constructed using exon-sized fragments from a human genomic region containing the 5q31 Interleukin gene cluster. The size-selected library contained sufficient diversity to cover the sequence space for a 50 kb BAC with 100 bp inserts. Selection of the epitope library using anti-Interleukin antibodies enriched for phage members containing 'true' Interleukin epitopes, as well as for other sequences. An IL-4 epitope sequence was selected from the library against the C19 antibody, which recognizes the C-terminal epitope of the last exon of IL-4 [18].

            "text": "While the library size can be defined by one number (N) and the effective size can be assessed by the percentage of antibody display, the diversity of a library has a somewhat elusive definition. Sometimes the size of an antibody repertoire is used as a proxy to characterize its diversity. However, it assumes that the antibody repertoire is a random set of antigen-binding site shapes and amino acid sidechains. Furthermore, not all antibody repertoires are created equal. \n\nFor instance, if one were to generate a library of antibody variants by diversifying all the 11 positions of the LCDR1 with the 20 amino acids, the resultant repertoire would be 20 11 or 2 \u00d7 10 14 antibody variants. This would appear to be a diverse repertoire based on its size and it would thus presumably lead to a large number of functional antibodies. Nevertheless, most of the amino acids in LCDR1 are located in the periphery of the antigen-binding site and have a marginal role in defining the binding properties of antibodies, especially for small and mid-sized targets [40]. Therefore, such a library would very likely be of limited use. In contrast, the same library size, e.g., 11 positions mutated to the 20 amino acids, but in the HCDR3, which is located at the center of the antigen-binding site and plays a critical role in recognizing diverse targets, would likely yield antibodies with reasonable affinity [41]. Hence, diversity is not only the number of in-frame and/or non-toxic antibody variants, but it is also the number of functional molecules capable of recognizing as many diverse targets as possible. \n\nThe first functional antibody repertoires used as a substrate to build phage display antibody libraries were obtained from immunized animals [42] or humans [43]. This type of library, known as immune, has been of limited application as general-purpose platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. Those obtained from immunized animals are single-use libraries as the libraries are biased toward the recognition of the antigen utilized as an immunogen. More importantly, the antibodies obtained from immune libraries, being nonhuman proteins, require further engineering (humanization), which increases the cost of the antibody drug development process.",

            "title": "High Affinity, Developability and Functional Size: The Holy Grail of Combinatorial Antibody Library Generation",
            "text": "Until the invention of phage display, immunization and murine hybridoma technology were the only methods available for the generation of antibodies. Hybridoma technology however has its limitations when the antigens are toxic or non-immunogenic in mice. More importantly, however, generation of antibodies to self-antigens can be challenging, especially when there are high sequence homologies between the human and the respective murine antigen. In vitro antibody selection methods, such as phage display, have set a new standard. An important advantage of these antibody generation technologies is the absence of technical limitations, such as the choice of antigen and the ability to tailor both affinities and cross-reactivities to what is required. The past decades have seen a rapid development of large antibody repertoires and display methods, namely phage display, ribosomal display and bacterial, yeast or mammalian cell surface display. Today a multitude of antibody libraries exists that differ both in design and means of construction. The focus of this review will be on antibody libraries developed to isolate therapeutic antibodies. It is in the nature of the subject that commercial libraries play a major part. \n\nOne of the greatest challenges in library selection as compared to in vivo methods is the absence of somatic hypermutation (SHM) which enables nature to create high-affinity antibodies. Different affinity maturation strategies are available to overcome this limitation. All of these methods are based on introducing a certain degree of diversity into selected, moderate affinity candidates, followed by repeated selection with increased selective pressure. Affinities that can be achieved directly from a combinatorial library, without affinity maturation, are expected to correlate, to a certain degree, with the size of the library. The probability of identifying high-affinity antibodies thus increases with library size [please refer to 1]. Functional library size, however, matters more than absolute library size and this can vary dramatically depending on the design and means of construction. \n\nAnother major challenge of in vitro selection methods is to deliver therapeutic antibodies that are developable and safe in human. Developability encompasses several different aspects of a therapeutic antibody: production, manufacturability, formulation interactions as well as the resulting shelf life. These parameters influence the costs of goods, but more importantly, affect dosing, modes of administration and can have an impact on drug safety.",

When the engineered nucleotide fragments of immunoglobulins encoding the antigen-binding region are displayed, it leads to generation of antibody phage display (APD) library. Antibody expression over the phage surface is a powerful platform that allows the selection of specific antibodies when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. Due to the vast applications of this important technique, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for developing and applying the phage display technique for the discovery and isolation of antibodies [1,39,40]. Major advantages of antibody phage display include as follows: production of large-sized combinatorial libraries, improved efficiency than conventional hybridoma system, easy manipulation, safety, no involvement of animal cell culture, lower propagative cost and easy screening procedures involved to select target specific binders [41][42][43]. Specifically for viral pathogens, antibody phage display is an alternative tool to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system [44].\n\nThe antibody phage display technique was first described using gene III protein of E. coli filamentous phages and was further modified. The display formats include single-chain fragment variable (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fabs), single-chain fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), variable domains of heavy chain (VHHs)-also called as nanobodies, immunoglobu",

First described for organ targeting using peptide phage libraries where the library was injected intravenously into mice and the phage were subsequently rescued from the brain and kidneys (64), the technique has also been successfully carried out in tumour-bearing mice (65). In recent years, similar methodologies have also been employed with antibody phage libraries not only to identify potentially therapeutic antibodies but also for determining the accessibility of a given target (66), further expanding the boundaries of phage display technology. \n\nToday, almost all widely accessible commercial libraries are based on non-immune repertoires of high complexity to enable use in the selection of antibodies against a virtually unlimited number of target antigens. The latest state-of-art libraries reach complexities of up to 10 11 -10 12 clones and thus may even exceed the size of individual human cell repertoires (67,68). While high-affinity antibodies can be isolated from these libraries, occasionally the affinity of the obtained antibodies is low as the genes are obtained from naive B cells that have not yet undergone affinity maturation. In such cases, where the affinity required for therapeutic efficacy is higher than that of the antibody obtained, in vitro affinity maturation may be performed. This is often accomplished by introducing random or specific mutations in the CDRs or the exchange of whole heavy or light chain domains by chain shuffling (69)(70)(71)(72)(73). Recently, Li et al. described an alternative phage display approach for affinity maturation of a natural human antibody MSL-109 targeting human cytomegalovirus (CMV), where each of the CDRs was allowed to vary in only one amino acid residue at a time (69). Higher affinity antibodies were isolated which had improved CMV neutralization potency when expressed as Fab fragments in bacterial cells. \n\nIn another novel application of in vitro phage library screening, single antibodies capable of dual epitope recognition have also been developed.",

            "text": "We describe an antibody optimization strategy that seeks to overcome the restrictive nature of existing affinity-maturation methods, by rapidly exploring a vast sequence space in an unbiased manner through application of PCR techniques and ribosome display. We exemplified the significance of this method by contrasting the crystal structure of the parent and optimized antibodies bound to Arginase 2, which revealed a striking reorientation of the binding paratope, concurrent with distinct improvements in inhibitory potency and binding properties. The nature and magnitude of the epitope expansion was extraordinary and unlikely to have been produced through conventional affinity-maturation methods. This innovative approach demonstrates broad applicability to the optimization of candidate therapeutic antibodies, even those less amenable to CDRH3 targeting. \n\nsynergistic mutations from different CDRs may be required to bring about substantial affinity gains. One way to connect such mutations is via recombination of selection outputs, which has been shown as a successful method in extending the affinity and potency gains achievable from the optimization of single CDRs (6)(7)(8)(9). Typically, recombination of only two CDRs, usually one from the variable heavy (VH) and one from the variable light (VL) region, is considered at a time for sufficient coverage within the library size limitations of phage display. Ribosome display does not require a bacterial transformation step and can theoretically cover populations of over 10 12 in size (9,10). It is therefore feasible to use ribosome display to select populations of larger sizes to cover libraries of greater diversity. Indeed, it has been shown that recombination libraries selected using ribosome display have the advantage of greater sequence and structural diversity compared to phage display (11), which affords a greater chance of finding improved binders. \n\nWith the greater capacity of ribosome display, it is possible to consider more ambitious library builds. We envisaged an approach in which advantageous mutations from all six CDRs could be allowed to recombine freely in an unbiased manner. Here we describe a strategy which utilizes antibody chain shuffling and the staggered-extension process (StEP) to create such libraries. \n\nAntibody chain shuffling involves a repairing of heavy-and light-chain repertoires in a population of antibody variants.",

In 1985, Smith (1985) inserted foreign genes into phages, displayed the foreign genes on phage coat proteins, and used phage display technology to construct single chain antibody libraries that could be screened for sequences expressing a specific scFv. Phages were stable under external factors (e.g., pH, temperature). Phage coat proteins can be modified to display foreign genes as fusion proteins without losing the infectivity of the phage. With the progress of technology, phage display technology has been matured, and phage peptide libraries, phage single chain antibody libraries and phage synthesis libraries can be established by phage display technology (Sunderland, Yang & Mao, 2017). Phage display can be used for the analysis of protein interactions as well as the screening of proteins or the selection of antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, mimicking natural antibody libraries through billions of phage particles presenting different antibodies. \n\nThe origin of the phage antibody libraries significantly affected on the species of phage antibody libraries. In general, the more diverse the sources, the greater the capacity of the phage antibody libraries (Frenzel, Schirrmann & Hust, 2016;Beerli & Rader, 2010). The main benefit of using phage display to obtain antibodies was that it was fast and did not need immunization of animals and humans. However, phage display systems included the T4, T7, \u03bb and M13 phage display systems (The differences between them were shown in Table 1). Among them, M13 phage was the most common phage in the construction of phage display single chain antibody libraries.",

            "text": "The immune repertoire was sourced from lymph nodes from seven different donors, peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine different donors, spleen from one donor, and tonsil RNA from five donors. All six CDRs from donor repertoires were amplified and reassembled into a single light (DP-L3) and heavy chain (VH3-23) framework that is well-presented in the human repertoire and well-expressed in host cells [47]. This approach circumvents loss in diversity due to low expression or the display level of certain germline genes. The library was validated against a range of haptens, peptides, carbohydrates, and proteins and has successfully isolated antibody clones with subnanomolar affinities; in fact, at least five mAbs generated using the n-CoDer TM library have entered clinical trials. The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]. In addition, two in vitro display platforms, phage and yeast display, were implemented to isolate diverse antibodies to clinically relevant protein targets, yielding affinities down to the subnanomolar and picomolar range demonstrating that this approach has the potential to considerably reduce discovery timelines. \n\nIn the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression.",

            "text": "Thirty years ago George Smith introduced 'phage display' as a means to express vast collections of recombinant proteins and peptides to be screened by affinity selection (1) (a process coined 'biopanning' (2)).Two basic systems evolved: (i) phage display of random peptide libraries and (ii) the production of phage displayed antibodies.The latter has been used extensively to generate human monoclonal antibodies (3)(4)(5)(6), replacing to some extent the production of murine monoclonal antibodies via classical hybridoma technology.The first system, random peptide libraries, was initially applied to the epitope analysis of a specific monoclonal antibody with the ultimate intent of affinity selection of a peptide-mimetic assumed to simulate and represent the cognate epitope of the antibody being studied (7,8).Cortese et al. went on to implement random peptide phage display to study polyclonal sera, demonstrating that pathogen related peptides could be isolated through biopanning peptide-libraries with disease-defining polyclonal serum (9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14).In many cases the application of phage display libraries was performed to clone out a specific peptide or antibody for further development and study.More recently, phage display has also served as the basis for computational prediction of epitope-structures (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21), as reviewed by Sun et al. (22) and for the critical profiling of the repertoire of antibody specificities of polyclonal sera, i.e. profiling the IgOme (23,24), see also (25).\n\nAn implicit assumption in phage displayed based applications is that the library to be screened truly represents an unbiased comprehensive collection of peptides from which affinity selection can proceed.The selected peptides can be taken, therefore, to faithfully represent the structural idiosyncrasies and/or specific binding activities of the antibody (or antibodies) being analyzed.",

            "text": "Phage display antibody technology has become increasing popular for creating binding sites for use in all areas of research, and in medical and industrial applications.\n\nThere are several examples of successful isolation of antibodies against various antigens from different phage displayed antibody libraries [11,17,33,35,43], including high throughput selection [44]. Unfortunately, the libraries are not available commercially; any laboratories that are interested in using this technique are required to construct a library by themselves, or obtained existing libraries for research with restrictions. Of the two types of phage antibody libraries (immunized and non-immunized libraries), the nonimmune library is of more general use, because it can be applied to generate antibodies to any desired antigen [12,28,33,35]. These \"naive\" libraries normally has been constructed from the light-chain and heavy-chain IgM-V-gene pools of B cells isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, or spleen cells of nonimmunized healthy donors [13,17,44]. However, it has been reported that the diversity of the library could also be maximized by using random hexamers to prime cDNA synthesis, so that all five antibody classes could potentially be represented [35]. Since the whole antibodies cannot be functionally expressed in bacteria, only the antibody fragments that contain the binding regions are displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage [10]. Most of the phage libraries that have been constructed display the antibody fragment on the surface of the phage minor coat proteins (pIII). It has been shown Inhibition ELISA of anti-Aflatoxin B1 antibody that both Fab [27,45] and scFv [11,13,23] can be expressed in the surface of M13 without apparent loss of the antibody's specificity and affinity. Since the scFv format has been shown to be more efficient for display on phage coat [33] and the aim of this research was to develop the most efficient method to construct a compact human antibody, the scFv format was chosen.\n\nSeveral strategies have been described for producing antibody phage display library in scFv format but it is difficult to define the minimal repertoire size needed to retrieve good binders to antigens. Many approaches have been proposed to",

            "text": "They found that antibodies directly discovered by phage display or engineered at some point by phage biopanning exhibit significant developability risks' properties compared to than those derived from immunized mice. Further investigations found that phage display derived therapeutic antibodies have higher self-interaction and poly-reactivity due to the higher percentage of aliphatic residues in their CDRs compared to the non-phage derived antibodies (112). \n\nAdditionally, antibodies selected form phage display libraries are not glycosylated, because they are produced in E. coli, as a result, some candidates when glycosylation occur during mammalian cells expression; their binding, biodistribution, or pharmacokinetics might be negatively impacted (113)(114)(115)(116). Therefore, using eukaryotic display platforms like yeast and mammalian display would be beneficial. For instance, in addition to their ability to produce glycosylated proteins, yeast and mammalian antibody libraries can be constructed to display fulllength antibodies as well as antibody fragments, such as scFvs and fragment antigen-binding region (Fabs) (117)(118)(119)(120)(121)(122)(123)(124)(125)(126), allowing the isolation of high affinity antibodies with definitive biological characteristics (122,123). For example, Parthiban et al. has developed mammalian libraries that display around 10 million clones in IgG-format on the surface of HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (127). These libraries can act as a quality filter for different antibody developability aspects, and to provide a very early insight into developability problems, such as aggregation and cross-reactivity. Each display system has its advantages and disadvantages, however, determining those are beyond the intended scope of this review, which is about the most commonly used type of antibody display, the phage display. Therefore, it is vital to generate phage libraries that allow for the isolation of highly specific and diverse mAbs with high affinity against diverse antigens with optimal developability potential (128)(129)(130).",

            "text": "The merits of molecular properties such as affinity and specificity of nanobodies depend on two factors: The capacity and diversity of the library. The preparation and screening of nanobodies are commonly used in a phage display library (40), which contains three library types: Natural, immune, and synthetic (91,92). The natural library is formed by amplifying the variable region genes of heavy chain antibodies from camel peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes that have not yet been immunized, then these variable region genes are recombined into phagemid vectors, and transformed into host bacteria to form antibody libraries (93,94). The immune library is an antibody library obtained by immunizing an alpaca or camel with an antigen protein, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the camel to amplify the variable region gene of the heavy chain antibody, and then recombining this variable region gene into a phagemid vector (94). The capacity of the immune library is lower than that of natural libraries, but numerous functional antibodies in the library recognize specific antigens for immunity, making screening of high-affinity antibodies a reality. For the construction of synthetic libraries (95), a certain VHH framework (such as cAbBcIll0) is generally selected as the backbone structure. Trinucleotide cassettes are used as a unit of raw materials to generate cdRs sequences. Then, the dNA of each region of VHH is assembled by PcR to form a complete VHH gene. The gene is cloned into a phagemid vector and transformed into an E. coli TG1 cell to form a library. The synthetic library, as an artificial library constructed by genetic engineering technology, has a great complementary role in the immune libraries and natural libraries and is an important source for screening high-affinity antibodies, with significant importance for the development of antibody drugs (91,95). \n\nThe phage display technology is used to screen binders for various targets from diverse and large libraries and is widely employed by various research teams.",

In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",

We used the computational methodology to assess antibody library designs to ensure that the antibody variants in the synthetic antibody libraries have substantial antibody-antigen interaction propensities, rather than just to imitate antibody sequences in nature or limit to the minimalist designs for antibody library constructions.

However, existing methods have several technical limitations such as low process throughput from laborious cloning process and waste of the phenotypic screening capacity from unnecessary repetitive tests on the dominant clones. To overcome the limitations, we developed a new high-throughput platform for the identification and retrieval of clones in the library, TrueRepertoire\u2122. TrueRepertoire\u2122 provides highly accurate sequences of the clones with linkage information between heavy and light chains of the antibody fragment. Additionally, the physical DNA of clones can be retrieved in high throughput based on the sequence information. We validated the high accuracy of the sequences and demonstrated that there is no platform-specific bias. Moreover, the applicability of TrueRepertoire\u2122 was demonstrated by a phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library targeting human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) protein.",

            "text": "Importantly, few developability liabilities were identified in the selected antibodies, emphasizing the value of well-designed na\u00efve libraries to accelerate the discovery, manufacturing and clinical testing of antibodies isolated from this type of libraries. In summary, we have demonstrated that na\u00efve general-purpose synthetic VH repertoires produce similar results than those obtained from an immune VH repertoire. Since Finally, one can argue that potent neutralizing antibodies, e.g., IgG-A7, were obtained from the immune library with a lesser effort, i.e., a fewer number of clones were screened and characterized, when compared to ALTHEA Gold Plus Libraries\u2122. Therefore, the immune library seemed to be a more efficient means to discover V regions for diagnostic and/or antibody-based drug development. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that although we characterized the outcome of each step in the stepwise discovery and optimization strategy, VH and VL RAM are amenable to automation without the need of intermediate characterization nor design of new libraries-we used the PLs as source of diversity in the RAM approach, which should speed-up the optimization process of antibodies selected during the discovery phase. In comparison, making immune libraries requires: (1) the identification of a donor with high titers of specific antibodies, (2) the collection of B-cells, (3) the RT-PCR repertoire of V regions, (4) to synthesize the libraries in a scFv or Fab format by PCR or molecular cloning, (5) cloning and electroporation of the libraries, and (6) library rescue and quality control. In our experience, these tasks may take, depending on the laboratory expertise, 4-6 weeks, whereas na\u00efve libraries are \"ready-to-use\" and, hence, bypass all the above steps. \n\nOf note, potent neutralizing anti-SASR-CoV-2 antibodies from na\u00efve libraries with similar or even higher potency than those obtained from immune libraries have recently been reported [6]. The authors performed two rounds of selection from a semisynthetic phage display na\u00efve library first, followed by yeast display sorting. This strategy combined the advantages of large and diverse na\u00efve phage display libraries with a precise subsequent yeast display selection using flow cytometry.",

            "text": "After carrying out one to two rounds of selection in phage, the diversity is reduced from 10 9-11 to 10 5-6 . This is compatible with straightforward cloning into yeast, and exploits the tremendous flexibility and sensitivity of the use of flow cytometry in subsequent antibody selection. Whereas traditionally up to 384 different clones are tested by ELISA after phage display, when phage and yeast display are combined as described here, every phage selected clone is tested individually: analogous to carrying out up to one million ELISAs, with the ability to sort out those that are positive in real time. This represents a significant advantage over using either phage or yeast display alone. In the former, the full selected diversity cannot be tested, while in the latter, it is already challenging to screen the na\u0131 \u00a8ve 10 9 clone yeast antibody library that is available [20], and significantly more so to access even larger initial diversities. By combining the display platforms, all potential positives in a phage library can be screened. \n\nUsing this approach we identified 111 different positive antibodies out of only 192 sequenced clones, and anticipate that the application of deep sequencing to the selection [46,47,48] will identify significantly more positive clones. Although we identified many different antibodies recognizing Ag85, we were unable to identify any with absolute specificity for one of the subunits over the others. In part, this is likely to be due to the way the selection was carried out: using a trimer of similar subunits the dominant epitopes will be those found in all three subunits. Future attempts to select subunit specific antibodies will involve selection against one subunit in an excess of the others. \n\nThe data presented here focus on Ag85, a soluble antigen. However, we believe this technology is not restricted to soluble protein antigens, but can also be applied to the isolation of antibodies against membrane proteins. Both phage [49] and yeast [50,51] display have been used to isolate antibodies in whole-cell panning experiments, and more recently specific protocols have been developed that allow the selection of antibodies against either random, or specific, membrane proteins [52]. Combining these well described methods with the approach described here, should allow the straightforward selection of antibodies against many different transmembrane proteins.",

Regardless of the limited number of donors and the limited library size (our library possesses 2.8 x 10 7 clones, while other libraries are in the range 10 8 to 10 10 clones 29,30,37 ), we were able to isolate phages binders to all tested antigens (Table 2).

The frequency of positive clones observed in the second panning was in agreement with previous results using different assembly methods, including SOE-PCR. 29,30,37 Moreover, we were able to identify different scFv sequences of binding phages obtained from the proteins TNF\u03b1, ErbB3 and MICA (Table 2 and Fig. 6). \n\nThe results obtained from random clone sequencing and phage binders isolations suggest that the ISA-PCR method is efficient in generating antibody diversity. \n\nThe success in the use of antibodies as therapeutic agents 43 and the advent of antibodies in high-throughput research have dramatically increased their demand. 44 Antibody phage display technology appears to be a suitable source of candidates. According to our experience, the use of ISA-PCR method would facilitate the development of antibody phage display libraries. It is noteworthy that the simplicity and the minimal equipment required for the ISA-PCR method could facilitate the construction of scFv The products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% w/v agarose gels and purified as previously using QIAQuick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN).",

            "text": "Antibody display libraries derived from human PBMCs or hybridomas immortalized from B cell populations have been successfully used in recent decades to isolate binders against a wide range of targets, despite a lack of detailed knowledge of the repertoires (34,35). With the advent of NGS, analysis of the natural na\u00efve repertoires from which libraries have been constructed has become possible. \n\nIn an early paper, the diversity of a phage displayed combinatorial library generated from the IgM repertoire of 654 healthy human donors was precisely quantified by deep sequencing preand post-selection using long-read pyrosequencing (12). Variable domain PCR amplicon and rolling circle amplified shotgun methods allowed an efficient assessment of diversity, as well as the correct assignment of heavy and light chain pairing. A novel application of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) accurately identified CDR regions. The sequencing results revealed that all germline families were present and a high degree of somatic mutations in CDR1 and CDR2 provided additional complexity to a library that was estimated to be similar in diversity to the number of transformants (3.5 \u00d7 10 10 ). The library was subjected to panning against 16 targets and pairing preferences were observed for heavy and light chains. This information was used to produce combinatorial libraries that mimic the natural repertoire both in length and sequence diversity. A synthetic Fab library was fabricated in which all six CDRs are diversified by synthetic enzymatic codon addition method allowing precise control of amino acid additions at each position in the CDRs, to recapitulate those found in nature. The library was subjected to panning against a diverse panel of receptors, growth factors, antigens, enzymes, and peptides. Binders were isolated for all antigens with nanomolar affinities measured for 6 out of 10 antigens (36). \n\nLarman et al. (37) describe an interesting synthetic approach where CDR sequences were designed using a HMM model of \"contact\" and\"non-contact\" states for amino acid positions based upon known antibody-antigen complexes.",

            "text": "such long loops tend to generate less stable antibodies and thus, the resultant antibodies are less developable than those with short HCDR3 loops. \n\nFinally, one can argue that potent neutralizing antibodies, e.g., IgG-A7, were obtained from the immune library with a lesser effort, i.e., a fewer number of clones were screened and characterized, when compared to ALTHEA Gold Plus Libraries\u2122. Therefore, the immune library seemed to be a more efficient means to discover V regions for diagnostic and/or antibody-based drug development. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that although we characterized the outcome of each step in the stepwise discovery and optimization strategy, VH and VL RAM are amenable to automation without the need of intermediate characterization nor design of new libraries-we used the PLs as source of diversity in the RAM approach, which should speed-up the optimization process of antibodies selected during the discovery phase. In comparison, making immune libraries requires: (1) the identification of a donor with high titers of specific antibodies, (2) the collection of B-cells, (3) the RT-PCR repertoire of V regions, (4) to synthesize the libraries in a scFv or Fab format by PCR or molecular cloning, (5) cloning and electroporation of the libraries, and (6) library rescue and quality control. In our experience, these tasks may take, depending on the laboratory expertise, 4-6 weeks, whereas na\u00efve libraries are \"ready-to-use\" and, hence, bypass all the above steps. \n\nOf note, potent neutralizing anti-SASR-CoV-2 antibodies from na\u00efve libraries with similar or even higher potency than those obtained from immune libraries have recently been reported [6]. The authors performed two rounds of selection from a semisynthetic phage display na\u00efve library first, followed by yeast display sorting. This strategy combined the advantages of large and diverse na\u00efve phage display libraries with a precise subsequent yeast display selection using flow cytometry. Importantly, few developability liabilities were identified in the selected antibodies, emphasizing the value of well-designed na\u00efve libraries to accelerate the discovery, manufacturing and clinical testing of antibodies isolated from this type of libraries.",

They reported that foreign peptides could be successfully expressed on the surface of bacteriophage particles by integrating a gene of interest into a phage genome upstream of its coat protein open reading frame (Smith, 1985). It is noteworthy that a conceptually similar study was independently conducted by a Russian scientific group led by A.A. Ilyichev, who incorporated a peptide-coding sequence into the pVIII protein gene of M13 phage (Ilyichev et al., 1992;Minenkova et al., 1993). Later, G. Smith and colleagues proposed a selection strategy for the enrichment of population of recombinant phage clones that specifically bind to the target ligand, using affinity enrichment process (Smith, 1985). Since there is a direct physical link between the genotype of the recombinant phage particle and the phenotype of the fusion protein, this method allows the identification of DNA sequences encoding selected molecules. \n\nSubsequently, G. Smith and colleagues described the crea tion of combinatorial phage libraries that contain a large number of phage particles, each carrying a unique protein or peptide on its surface. Currently, one the most common types of phage libraries used for studying various proteinto-protein, receptor-ligand interactions or protein engineering are antibody phage libraries displaying single-stranded (scFv) and antigen-binding (Fab) fragments of IgG molecules (McCafferty et al., 1990;Winter et al., 1994). There are also alternative antibody formats used for the construction of antibody phage libraries, such as variable domains of antibodies from the heavy chains of camelids (VHH, or nanobodies) and sharks (vNAR) (Davies, Riechmann, 1995;Greenberg et al., 1995). \n\nIn order to create phage antibody library, antibody fragments to be exposed are usually fused to the N-terminus of the pIII phage coat protein.",

            "text": "Display technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process. Phage library diversity can be derived from na\u00efve human B cells, 2 synthetic engineered antibody sequences 3 or from B cell-rich tissue of immunized animals; 4 libraries generated by the latter method are often referred to as immune phage display libraries. Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

            "text": "Phage display libraries can be categorized into various types, depending on their origin and complexity, allowing for the presentation of peptides, proteins, or analogous molecules that mimic antigens. The prevailing varieties of phage display libraries employed in epitope mapping include random phage display peptide libraries (RPL) and gene or genome fragment libraries (GFL) [27]. These libraries possess distinct attributes and play a crucial role as valuable tools in unraveling epitopes. \n\nRPLs are generated by introducing random nucleotide sequences into the phage display vector, offering versatility in identifying both linear and conformational epitopes. This includes the discovery of novel epitopes that may not naturally occur in proteins. The two main types of RPLs are linear peptide libraries and restricted peptide libraries. In linear peptide libraries, the amino acid sequences of the peptides can vary widely, without The length and linear/cyclic nature of displayed peptides in phage display have a significant impact on the selection outcome. Shorter peptides offer increased flexibility but may have lower affinities and more nonspecific interactions [34], while longer peptides provide more interaction potential but may face constraints and hindrances. Cyclic peptides exhibit enhanced stability and rigidity [35], leading to improved affinities and resistance to degradation, whereas linear peptides offer flexibility and conformational diversity. Optimal peptide length and conformation vary based on the target and experimental conditions. Researchers must carefully consider these factors during library design to enhance the chances of identifying peptides with desired binding properties in phage display selections. \n\nWhile phage display is a powerful technique for identifying epitopes, there are some disadvantages to consider. One potential issue is the risk of false positives or false negatives due to the complexity of the screening process [36]. This can occur if the phage library is not sufficiently diverse or if the screening conditions are not optimized for the specific antibody or epitope of interest. Additionally, the size of the phage library and the number of potential epitopes to screen can be a limitation, as large libraries may require extensive sequencing and analysis, and the screening process may miss rare or low-affinity epitopes.",

A large repertoire of functional antibodies with similar properties was produced by appending short variable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) onto the two antibody germ line segments most frequently found in human antibodies. With this strategy we concentrated sequence diversity in regions of the antibody structure that are centrally located in the antigen binding site, while leaving residues in more peripheral positions available for further mutagenesis aimed at improving the affinity of the selected antibodies. In addition, the library was tested by selecting antibodies against six biologically relevant antigens. Using only 0.3 \u03bcg of antigen eluted from a two-dimensional gel spot, we isolated binders specific for the ED-B domain of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis. These antibodies recognize the native antigen with affinities in the 107\u2013108 m \u22121 range, and perform well in immunosorbent assays, in two-dimensional Western blotting and in immunohistochemistry. The affinity of one anti-ED-B antibody was improved by 27-fold by combinatorially mutating six strategically selected residues in the heavy chain variable domain. A further 28-fold affinity improvement could be achieved by mutating residues 32 and 50 of the light chain. The resulting antibody, L19, bound to the ED-B domain of fibronectin with very high affinity (K d = 54 pm), as determined by real-time interaction analysis with surface plasmon resonance detection, band shift analysis, and by competition experiments with electrochemiluminescent detection.",

Two immune bLinS V HH phage display libraries were constructed following immunization of a llama with purified S. clavuligerus bLinS. A \"Bleed 1\" library and a \"Bleed 2\" library, constructed using genetic material isolated following the third and fifth injections were of size 1 and 5 \u00d7 10 7 , respectively. Both libraries were enriched using biopanning utilizing two varying wash conditions, in an effort to capture a wider spectrum of bLinS binding affinities. Following the first round of biopanning for each library and wash condition, 95 colonies from each were screened to determine the efficacy of enrichment. Of the 380 total colonies screened, 93% were identified as bLinS binders by ELISA. Sequencing of these clones yielded 261 unique V HH sequences and 158 unique CDR3 sequences within the enriched populations (Supplementary Figure 1). DoE Optimization of Cytoplasmic V HH Production. To utilize the resultant anti-bLinS V HH for synthetic biology applications, a platform that facilitated functional production of correctly folded antibodies within the cytoplasm of E. coli was required. Given the large number of bLinS binders obtained following library enrichment, a series of optimized conditions for a single V HH were first identified. Two of these platforms were subsequently tested on a wider subset of V HH in order to determine the efficacy of each. As the most commonly occurring clone within the sequenced population of the enriched libraries, the anti-bLinS V HH B2D C10 was chosen for the initial development of the production system. \n\nWhen considering the optimization of protein production, traditional experimental approaches such as the sequential alteration of individual factors do not always prove time and resource effective. Furthermore, in large multifactor systems key interactions between factors may be missed, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the system in question. This is especially true within biological systems in which complex interactions, such as those between environmental and genetic factors, may have significant effects on a chosen response. Design of Experiments (DoE) is a structured method of experimental design that provides statistical insights to better understand and subsequently optimize complex, multifactor systems.",

            "text": "Next, we applied a homolog-scan strategy to investigate the functional contributions of individual side chains involved in antigen-antibody interactions in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of GC058. Homolog-scan combinatorial mutagenesis introduces subtle mutations in the CDR sequences of the parental antibody, providing the potential for fine-tuning the existing interactions at the antigen-antibody interface. As a result, antibodies with higher binding affinities or specificities could potentially be obtained under conditions with controlled stringency during selection. \n\nIn library F, from which GC058 was isolated, diversity was only introduced into the 3 heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDR3. 22 Thus, for the homolog-scan analysis we constructed a single library that targeted a total of 30 residues in these 4 CDRs (Fig. 2). We replaced the wild type codon in each scanned position with a binary codon that encodes only the wild type and a similar amino acid, as described previously. 23 The library  39 Residues in specificity-tuned clones that are different from the parental clone GC058 are shown in white with black background. The signal ratios of Fab-phage bound to L55F vs. WT in phage ELISA (L55/WT) were determined as the mean values from 3 independent measurements. contained 5.8 \u00a3 10 9 unique members, which exceeded the number of all possible theoretical combinations encoded by the binary degenerate codons (1.1 \u00a3 10 9 ) by approximately five-fold, thus providing good sampling of the theoretical diversity. \n\nPhage pools from the homolog-scan library were subjected to 2 parallel selections. Display selection against the anti-FLAG antibody M2 was performed to quantify display biases, since a FLAG tag was fused to the C terminus of the phage-displayed Fab light chain. Statistical analysis of the clones identified from this selection can reveal amino acid preferences at each position for Fab display on phage particles. Following four rounds of selection for binding to anti-FLAG antibody M2, 40 unique binding clones were sequenced. Functional selection was performed to isolate GC058 variants capable of binding to L55F with higher specificity.",

            "text": "Phage display is the first and still the most widely used technology for in vitro antibody selection. The strategy was developed based on the excellent work of George P. Smith in 1985 [14], who used recombinant DNA techniques to fuse foreign peptides with a coat protein (pIII) of bacteriophage M13 in order to display peptides on the bacteriophage surface. He then created \"antibody-selectable phage vectors\" and described an in vitro method that enabled affinity selection of antigen-specific phagedisplayed antibodies from 10 8 -fold excess phage pools [92]. It was later discovered that scFv, small antibody formats, can be expressed on phage filaments. At the time, there were three different research institutions independently establishing phage-displayed scFv or Fab antibody libraries: the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the UK [13,93,94], the German Cancer Research Center in Germany [95], and Scripps Research Institute in the USA [96]. Since then, these phagedisplayed antibody libraries have proven to be a reliable discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human mAbs [97].\n\nThe process of identifying mAbs from a phagedisplayed library begins with antibody-library construction (Fig. 4a). The variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, representing the Ig gene-encoding repertoire, are ligated into a phage display vector (phagemid). High quality mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The different V H and V L chain-region gene families are then amplified using specific primers to amplify all transcribed variable regions within the Ig repertoire [98,99]. The format of antibodies in a phage-displayed library can be either scFv or Fab fragments (Fig. 4b); scFvs are composed of the V H and V L domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100,101",

            "text": "Here, we introduced a new robust and high-throughput platform, TrueRepertoire\u2122, for the identification and retrieval of clones in a phage display library. TrueRepertoire\u2122 is composed of two systems designed for clone isolation and clone identification. In the clone isolation system, microcolonies of clones in the library can be formed in high density using the micro biochip SSICLE, and the microcolonies can be extracted from the chip in high throughput without contact by laser. The isolated colonies can be analyzed by the clone identification system of the platform to compute highly accurate consensus sequence of the clones while preserving the linkage information between heavy and light chains of the clone. By using these novel systems, TrueRepertoire\u2122 can identify and retrieve a massive number of clones, including rare clones, from a phage display library. We identified and retrieved 955 unique clones from the phage-displayed scFv library targeting hHGF by using TrueRepertoire\u2122. In addition, as shown in the application of TrueRepertoire\u2122 section, while the linkage information between heavy and light chains is preserved in TrueRepertoire\u2122, the linkage information is lost in NGS. Thus, TrueRepertoire\u2122 saves substantial effort and time by preserving the real linkage between heavy and light chains of clones. In the study discussed here, we validated that the consensus sequences have high accuracy and there is no platform specific bias in TrueRepertoire\u2122. Also, we succeeded in identifying and retrieving many rare clones by applying the platform to the phage-displayed scFv library targeting hHGF. The retrieved clones were confirmed to have binding activity to the target antigen, hHGF. In addition, the functional diversity of the identified clones in the library was shown by analyzing the HCDR3 region of the clones. The clones had heterogeneous HCDR3 in the aspect of sequence length and amino acid composition. Considering the heterogeneity, the clones are expected to bind to different epitopes of hHGF, as reported previously. 33 TrueRepertoire TM can identify and retrieve clones from antibody libraries at a much lower cost compared to the existing two methods, in vitro screening and NGS-based method.

PuLSE runs on a collection of sequence reads in the fastq file format and generates tables profiling the library in terms of unique DNA sequence counts and positions, translated peptide sequences, and normalized \u2018expected\u2019 occurrences from base to residue codon frequencies. The output allows at-a-glance quantitative quality control of a phage library in terms of sequence coverage both at the DNA base and translated protein residue level, which has been missing from toolsets and literature.

            "text": "All these researchers pursued the creation of phage-displayed combinatorial antibodies libraries, which were further improved by several other laboratories in the following years [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. As recognition of the phage display contribution to scientific advances in chemistry and pharmaceutics, George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for phage visualization of peptides and antibodies\" [21]. More recently, the phage display has been useful for the mapping of antibody binding epitope and the screening of combinatorial peptide libraries in drugs discovery [22][23][24]. A timeline of phage display development is shown in Figure 1. Nowadays, the phage display allows the production of vast libraries of peptides displayed on the surface of phage particles, which can differ for quantities and length of peptides, allowing the selection of binding partners for several applications in medicine, biotechnology, and pharmacology [25]. Among the enormous diversity of peptide or protein variants shown in a phage library (10 9 -10 10 different phages), those with high affinity and specificity for the target are isolated through affinity selection loops [26]. In this way, large amounts of peptide ligands can be quickly identified and amplified by an in vitro selection process called \"panning\". Phage clones selected for high affinity binding to the bait can be easily sequenced at the genomic level in order to determine the amino acid sequence of the peptide insert required for the binding [27]. The high flexibility of phages to display proteins with various sizes and properties without prior knowledge of their structure and sequence has led to new applications. Hence, a modern era in drug discovery has emerged concurrently with the development of phage display technology.",

            "text": "The libraries can therefore be more simply cloned, expanded, and controlled than phage libraries. \n\nBy infecting \"helper\" phage (based on M13) into a growing culture of E. coli harboring a phagemid library, the phage propagation machinery is provided, but due to a mutation introduced in the origin of replication on the helper phage genome, preferential packaging of the phagemid DNA and p3 fusion occurs during phage replication (7). Phage production is thereby induced, genotype-to-phenotype linkage is created, and the expressed phage particles are interrogated for the presence of useful protein sequences via target binding. This selective step may be performed by simply immobilizing the target protein on, for example, a protein-binding plastic surface such as an ELISA plate, adding phage, and allowing binding to occur via the antibody-p3 fusion proteins. Nonbinding phage are removed by washing the immobilized surface, and the remaining bound phage are eluted. The eluted phage is then reinfected back into a fresh culture of E. coli to retrieve the selected gene sequences. This process is not perfect, however, and two to four rounds of selection/reexpression/ selection are normally performed iteratively to remove all unwanted clones and enrich the binding population from the background of the library. Nonetheless, this process can be spectacularly powerful, massively enriching specific antibodies in a single selection round (8). Furthermore, the use of multiple forms of the target antigen in sequential selection rounds and the inclusion of competitor proteins can drive the selected pool toward a highly specific set of epitopes. \n\nMuch of the evolution and progression of phage display technology has been driven by the remarkable discovery that this method can be used to mine large libraries of combinatorial human antibody diversity, theoretically removing the need for animals in antibody production (9). By random recombination of V H and V L sequences from human lymphocyte cDNA (9), or, by using degenerate oligonucleotides to create diversity of DNA sequence in the loops associated with target binding (10), several groups have created very large libraries of antibody gene sequences for phage display.",

It is based on the fusion of each antibody sequence to the sequence of the pIII surface protein of the filamentous bacteriophage M13, a natural virus of the bacterium Escherichia coli with the shape of a 1-\u03bcm-long and 10-nm-wide cylinder (17). The engineered phage encapsulates the DNA sequence of an antibody and displays the corresponding polypeptide at its surface. Populations of up to 10 14 phages displaying a total diversity of up to 10 10 different antibodies can, thus, be manipulated. A round of selection consists of retrieving the phages bound to either the bottom of a plate, where the PVP target is attached, or magnetic beads, where the DNA target is coated. It is followed by a round of amplification achieved by infecting bacteria with the selected phages. We performed experiments where each sequence is initially present in at least 10 4 copies and where targets are provided in at least a 100-fold excess. Starting either from a single library (single framework) or a mixture of different libraries, three rounds of selection/amplification were performed. Although the enrichment of some of the sequences is intended to reflect binding to the specified targets, other factors may contribute, such as sequence-specific differences in amplification. In our experiments, such nontarget-specific selective factors can be detected but are nondominant (SI Appendix). Our analysis and its interpretation, however, do not rely on the precise nature of the selective pressure.\n\nHigh-Throughput Sequencing. We sequenced samples of 10 6 \u2212 10 7 sequences at different rounds of selection by Illumina Miseq paired-end high-throughput sequencing (18).

            "text": "Display of foreign peptide on the bacteriophage surface without affecting phage infection was first described by George P. Smith in 1985. 37 Since then, phage display technology has been extensively applied to various applications, e.g., protein evolution (also known as directed evolution), epitope determination, identification of enzyme substrates, and drug discovery. 38 Since phenotype and genotype are physically linked in a phage display system, protein variants with desired properties can be rapidly selected through panning and the genetic information can be readily extracted. In a phage display system, a library in which diversified peptide or protein variants are displayed on phage surface is constructed (typically 10 10 \u2212 10 12 diversity). Variants with favored properties are enriched during iterative selection cycles. Unique sequences can then be screened for further applications. While the success of phage display has been demonstrated in a wide variety of areas, this review will focus on its application in therapeutic antibody discovery.\n\nAntibody phage display was originally developed in three institutes: Institute of Cell and Tumor Biology at German Cancer Research Center (Germany), 39 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (United Kingdom), 40,41 and Scripps Research Institute (United States). 42,43 Since then, various antibody fragment formats have been commonly used for phage display, such as single chain variable fragment (scFv), 44,45 antigen binding fragment (Fab), 24,46 single-domain antibody (VHH), 47,48 and bispecific antibody fragment. [49][50][51] Although display of full-length IgG on phage was also reported, 52,53 this platform was not widely used, likely due to unstable display, low display level, and bias on phage propagation, which resulted in limited functional diversity of the library. However, strategies for functional screening in fulllength IgG format after phage panning have been reported, e.g., dual host vector, 54 donor-acceptor system, 55 highthroughput reformatting, and mammalian expression of phage-derived antibodies. 56,57 Nevertheless, the display of full-length antibody can be readily achieved by eukaryotic display platforms, such as yeast and mammalian cell display.

            "text": "Various methods have been developed for the isolation of antibodies from humans including B-cell immortalization and single-cell expression cloning [15]. Among these approaches, high-throughput screening of phage-displayed antibody libraries has become one of the leading technologies for generating human therapeutic antibodies (Figure 1) [16]. Nowadays, very large phage display libraries from naive (IgM) B-cell repertoires (>10 10 independent clones) are widely used for the selection of human antibodies against a broad panel of targets including human self-antigens to identify high-affinity binders. However, these antibodies are not affinity-matured by the human immune system. Hence, the preparation of combinatorial immune libraries from immunized or infection cured donors can deliver a broader range of highly functional antibodies, even from smaller libraries (i.e., potent antiviral antibodies with broadly neutralizing efficacies). For instance, the selection of combinatorial immune repertoires (>10 8 independent clones) from HSV seropositive donors resulted in a broad panel of various high-affinity binders with partly HSV-neutralizing properties [17,18]. \n\nAlthough various other in vitro selection platforms have been developed during the last decades (e.g., ribosome display and yeast display), phage display using filamentous phages is predominantly used for library generation since it is robust, inexpensive, and allows the automation of the selection and screening process. Due to the limitation in the production of fulllength IgG antibodies in Escherichia coli, only smaller antibody fragments (e.g., scFvs or Fabs) can be efficiently expressed within the E. coli periplasm as functional proteins.

This technique recently has been further refined to screen and sort in a single round high-affinity phage-displayed antibodies against virus glycoproteins by undertaking electrophoresis under two alternating electrical fields (lateral and vertical) through an agarose gel 'functionalized' with the respective antigen, where the antigen of interest is linked to agarose gel via a heterobifunctional photo-crosslinker. Antigen-specific antibodies are captured at several outlet channels with high affinity phage antibodies concentrated at the channels nearest to the inlet port and lower affinity phage antibodies separated at channels furthest from the application site [288]. Such sample handling capacity will vastly increase the number of selection campaigns that can be undertaken in parallel in a rapid and cost-effective fashion, such as the 'multiplex' approach adopted to identify functional VHHs directed to the FSH receptor by encompassing a variety of antigen formats [289]. Consequently, high throughput methods have been devised for conversion to full length IgG to solve the reformatting bottleneck [290], as well as Fc-fusion generation and purification [291]. \n\nFinally, several limitations and resolutions created to mitigate against drawbacks not previously discussed elsewhere in this review are outlined, as follows. While phage display has several advantages over other platforms, such as providing a fast and cheap route to the discovery of biologics and being able to generate large library repertoires, there have been several challenges that have been solved to optimize this display methodology, such as employing bioinformatic methods (and more recently, AI/ML methods) to avoid base bias, amino acids at 'unnatural' positions, sequence liability, and good expression profiles. Expression bias and folding errors can be problematic as the E. coli bacterial host shows a preference in expressing proteins rich in certain amino acids (methionine and lysine) and is not able to fold complex immunoglobulins nor provide critical post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bonds.",

This discovery was combined with the phage display process to make an effi cient method of isolating antibodies and their corresponding gene sequences simultaneously [ 7 ]. In the antibody phage display process, libraries of diverse V-gene sequences are cloned into an appropriate expression vector in E. coli , creating an in-frame fusion with the p3 protein or, as favored in most recently described libraries, a truncated form of p3. \n\nThe phage display of protein libraries was originally performed using \"phage\" vectors (i.e., built upon the phage genome itself), but due to practical diffi culties in handling these libraries, more recent phage methods have mostly used so-called phagemid expression vectors. In this case, the DNA backbone is a stable, small plasmid such as pUC, and the p3 gene plus f1 phage packaging origin are the only phage-derived DNA sequences [ 8 ]. These phagemid libraries are more easily handled and more stable than phage libraries, as the plasmid is incapable of causing phage production by itself. The libraries can therefore be more simply cloned, expanded, and controlled than phage libraries. \n\nBy infecting \"helper\" phage (based on M13) into a growing culture of E. coli harboring a phagemid library, the phage propagation machinery is provided, but due to a mutation introduced in the origin of replication on the helper phage genome, preferential packaging of the phagemid DNA and p3 fusion occurs during phage replication [ 8 ].

            "text": "Library:library screening technologies hold substantial promise for paired antibody:antigen discovery, but challenges have persisted. In this issue of Cell Reports Methods, Wagner et al. introduce a method that combines antibody-ribosome-mRNA complexes, antigen cell surface display, and single-cell RNA sequencing to successfully screen diverse antibody gene libraries against a library of viral receptor proteins. \n\nAffinity-based screening technologies are firmly established as effective tools to discover lifesaving medicines and reveal fundamental features of natural immune responses. Most high-throughput affinitybased antibody discovery techniques use protein display of a diverse library of antibody genes expressed on a phage, cell, or ribosome. Several rounds of panning against a target antigen are used to select or enrich for binding molecules. Success rates can vary depending on the platform, antigen, and the performance requirements for the desired antibody. 1,2 ommon techniques screen for antibody binding to just a single antigen, often incorporating a large antibody gene library that can exceed 10 10 variants in phage display. However, panning a library against a single target selects for specificity only to that antigen, at the potential expense of recognizing other antigens, and many applications also require understanding or selecting for binding diversity against a panel of multiple antigens. A few examples include the need to evaluate cross-reactivity against related proteins (e.g., highly evolved viral families like SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and HIV-1), engineering antibodies for multi-species recognition, and identifying drug polyspecificity risks early in therapeutic development. More complex technologies to screen antibody and antigen libraries against each other at the same time (a library:library screen) offer the ability to track and/or select for antibody recognition against multiple antigens at the same time. \n\nSeveral notable technologies have been developed for library:library screening. \n\nHere, we will highlight a few developments, although due to space limitations, we unfortunately cannot list all the relevant advances.",

This schematic depicts the different types of phage antibody libraries that can be constructed (top panel) and the iterative process of phage panning (bottom panel), which is equally applicable to the phage display of alternative scaffolds. The immune repertoire can be sourced from natural, semisynthetic, or fully synthetic variable genes and cloned into a phagemid vector. The resulting cloned repertoire is linked to gene3 for phage display, where E. coli is transformed with the phagemid library and then transfected with helper phage to produce the phage display library. This library is then incubated with the target antigen format to enrich for specific binders, where several washing steps are used to eliminate nonspecific binders and background. The remaining pool of phage binders are then eluted using a variety of methods (such as acidic pH or enzymatic cleavage of the linker between pIII and the antibody fragment) and used to transform E. coli for overnight amplification. This cycle is known as a round of selection. After three to five rounds of selection, single phage clones are evaluated for the specificity of their binding for the initial hit analysis and undergo DNA sequencing in parallel to determine the diversity of the positive phage antibody clone hits.

Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.",

In addition, vectors have been developed that can express antibodies both on phage as well as in mammalian cell culture as full length IgG through the use of intron-mediated differential splicing without any need for sub-cloning, which enables rapid highthroughput expression analysis of the full length antibody (104).

            "text": "Abstract Peptide-expressing phage display libraries are widely used for the interrogation of antibodies. Affinity selected peptides are then analyzed to discover epitope mimetics, or are subjected to computational algorithms for epitope prediction. A critical assumption for these applications is the random representation of amino acids in the initial na\u00efve peptide library. In a previous study, we implemented next generation sequencing to evaluate a na\u00efve library and discovered severe deviations from randomness in UAG codon over-representation as well as in high G phosphoramidite abundance causing amino acid distribution biases. In this study, we demonstrate that the UAG over-representation can be attributed to the burden imposed on the phage upon the assembly of the recombinant Protein 8 subunits. This was corrected by constructing the libraries using supE44-containing bacteria which suppress the UAG driven abortive termination. We also demonstrate that the overabundance of G stems from variant synthesis-efficiency and can be corrected using compensating oligonucleotide-mixtures calibrated by mass spectroscopy. Construction of libraries implementing these correctives results in markedly improved libraries that display random distribution of amino acids, thus ensuring that enriched peptides obtained in biopanning represent a genuine selection event, a fundamental assumption for phage display applications.",

            "text": "After the introduction of target-based drug discovery approaches, time consuming trial-and-error processes were replaced with high throughput library screenings to identify highly specific drug molecules [33]. Due to its simplicity, cost effectiveness, and speed, phage display has been one of the most widely used screening methods and has led to small peptide and antibody drugs discovery [34]. The technology involves the fusion of peptides/proteins into the genome of bacteriophages (phages) to be expressed on the phage surface as fusions to the coat proteins [35,36]. The physical link between the displayed peptides/proteins and their encoded DNA sequence enables identification of high-affinity binders through DNA sequencing after the phage display combinatorial library screening against the target of interest [37][38][39]. After the first description of phage display peptide libraries in 1985 by George Smith [40], the technique was used for the construction of antibody libraries by Gregory Winter and his colleagues, who pioneered the development of antibody drugs by phage display technology [41,42]. Phage display technology as well as the different phage display platforms used in drug discovery have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be further discussed herein [43][44][45]. In this review, we summarize the most common protein scaffolds used in construction of phage display libraries and their current applications in antiviral discovery. In addition, we discuss the present status of various developed antivirals in clinical research and the challenges they face in penetrating the clinic.",

            "text": "Phage display (88,89) has been widely used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for research and therapeutic purposes (90)(91)(92)(93)(94). While the first HIV-1 bNAbs were isolated from phage libraries (95), single-cell approaches have contributed most of the new bNAbs (96). Nonetheless, both scFvs and fragment antigen binding regions can be displayed on the phage surface and subjected to a selection process known as biopanning. Although NGS has been used to estimate the diversity of antibody phage libraries (97,98), its broader application has been restricted by the insufficient read length to cover both HC and LC in a scFv sequence (>800 bp). It was recently proposed that once this technical barrier is overcome, NGS can be used to directly select functional mAbs from a scFv library (99, 100), rendering a quantitative method for antibody discovery. \n\nHere, we addressed this technical challenge in a case study of the PGT121 lineage. We first characterized three types of antibody libraries constructed from PBMCs of donor-17 using gel electrophoresis (Figure 2A). Two antibody libraries were generated using different PCR methods-multiplex PCR (with gene-specific primers) and 5\u2032-RACE PCR (with single 3\u2032-reverse primers)-and showed bands around 500 and 600 bp, respectively (15). By contrast, the scFv library generated using H/L-overlapping PCR and a large primer set (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), as well as four post-panning libraries, yielded distinctive bands around 900 bp. This comparison highlights the difficulty in sequencing full-length scFv libraries. Previously, we demonstrated an extended read length of 600-700 bp in the unbiased NGS analysis of antibody repertoires using the Ion Torrent PGM and a modified protocol with 1,200 nucleotide flows (15,17,46,101). Can this NGS platform be adapted for sequencing scFvs? To test this possibility, we sequenced the donor-17 scFv libraries on the PGM using an Ion 314v2 chip and 1,500 nucleotide flows (Figure 2B).",

We have constructed a large size (10^11) human antibody VH domain library based on thermo-stable, aggregation-resistant scaffolds. This diversity was obtained by grafting naturally occurring CDR2s and CDR3s from healthy donors with optimized primers into the VH library. This phage-displayed library was used for bio-panning against various antigens. So far, panels of binders have been isolated against different viral and tumor targets, including the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, HIV-1 ENV protein, mesothelin and FLT3. In the present study, we discuss domain library construction, characterize novel VH binders against human CD22 and PD-L1, and define our design process for antibody domain drug conjugation (DDC) as tumoricidal reagents. Our study provides examples for the potential applications of antibody domains derived from library screens in therapeutics and provides key information for large size human antibody domain library construction.",

Among all currently available techniques, phage display remains one of the most popular approaches. Despite being a fairly old method, phage display is still widely used for studying protein-protein, peptide-protein and DNA-protein interactions due to its relative simplicity and versatility. Phage display allows highly representative libraries of peptides, proteins or their fragments to be created. Each phage particle in a library displays peptides or proteins fused to its coat protein and simultaneously carries the DNA sequence encoding the displayed peptide/protein in its genome. The biopanning procedure allows isolation of specif ic clones for almost any target, and due to the physical link between the genotype and the phenotype of recombinant phage particles it is possible to determine the structure of selected molecules. Phage display technology continues to play an important role in HIV research. A major obstacle to the development of an effective HIV vaccine is an extensive genetic and antigenic variability of the virus. According to recent data, in order to provide protection against HIV infection, the so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies that are cross-reactive against multiple viral strains of HIV must be induced, which makes the identif ication of such antibodies a key area of HIV vaccinology. In this review, we discuss the use of phage display as a tool for identif ication of HIV-specif ic antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. We provide an outline of phage display technology, brief ly describe the design of antibody phage libraries and the affinity selection procedure, and discuss the biology of HIV-1-specif ic broadly neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we summarize the studies aimed at identif ication of broadly neutralizing antibodies using various types of phage libraries.",

            "text": "mammalian cell-surface display, mRNA display, and DNA display have been used for antibody discovery [132]. Among these, phage display is the most widely used for antibody selection [133]. Its use has resulted in the discovery of over 80 mAbs that have entered clinical trials [134]. In 2002, adalimumab became the first phage display-derived mAb to have been granted market approval, and was also the first approved human mAb [131]. Small recombinant antibody fragments (e.g., scFv) [135,136] or fragment antigen-binding (Fab) [137,138] are also commonly selected by phage display, in addition to full antibodies [139]. A selection of FDA-approved phage display-derived antibody therapeutics are summarized in Table 2. Four exceptions in this table are the non-antibody peptides ecallantide (Kalbitor \u00ae ), Romiplostim (Nplate \u00ae ), albigutide (Tanzeum \u00ae ), and Xyntha purification peptide. Antibody libraries are huge collections (>10 10 ) of antibody genes encoding antibodies with unknown properties. These are an essential resource for antibody discovery by phage display and other in vitro selection technologies [133]. Depending on their source of origin, antibody libraries are classified as immune libraries and universal libraries. Immune libraries containing affinity-matured antibodies [133] are constructed using donors (humans or animals) who have received immunization, have been infected or a chronically-diseased, or those suffering from cancer [140]. Affinity maturation is achieved by mutation and clonal selection in which mutated antibodies with higher antigen-binding affinity are enriched [141]. However, extensive or hypermutation may increase the risk of immunogenicity [133]. Of course, it is not possible to construct immune libraries for each disease due to ethical issues, high cost, and laborious procedures. One solution to this problem is to use universal libraries that are generated by a source for which the immune system had not been activated to recognize a specific antigen (na\u00efve) [132]. Moreover, due to the lack of affinity maturation, these universal libraries have low risk of immunogenicity [133]. In principle, a universal library can be applicable to mAb selection",

            "text": "Therefore, when using whole cells as target, the output phage pool becomes even more complex than when using a single target antigen, as antibodies are potentially enriched against hundreds of receptors present at different levels on the cell surface. Traditional immunochemical screening, where a few thousand randomly selected antibodies from such an extremely complex output pool are tested, in this study denoted \"direct screening, \" will primarily identify the most frequent antibodies and specificities, since only a small subset of the antibody diversity will be covered (Figure 1). \n\nTo fully utilize the size and thereby the potential of phage display libraries, there is a need to develop deep mining methods that allow discovery of antibodies of low abundance. To set up such deep mining methods, we have used a phage pool that has previously been generated using our antibody library, n-CoDeR \u00ae , (Soderlind et al., 2000) subjected to differential cell panning on CLL cells as target, using B-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as non-target for negative selection pressure (Ljungars et al., 2018). Screening of clones from this pool has identified antibodies targeting six cell surface receptors, CD21, CD23, CD32, CD72, CD200, and HLA-DR. \n\nIn this study, we show that there are indeed additional antibodies to be found in the anti-CLL phage pool, targeting additional receptors as well as new epitopes on antigens for which binders had already been discovered in the past. Several deep mining strategies for discovery of low-abundant clones are evaluated with respect to mining efficiency.",

Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library.

This method was used to clone a diverse panel of human mAbs in Fab format to tetanus toxoid after generating an antibody library from peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from human donors who had received a booster vaccination. 73,74 A major drawback of this method is its limitation to screening as opposed to selecting antibody libraries. The number of independent clones, i.e., lysis plaques, that can be screened, even if the antigen of interest is in unlimited supply, is practically confined to 10 6 . \n\nSubsequent combinatorial strategies, e.g., phage, yeast and mammalian cell display, replaced screening with selection, allowing the mining of much larger antibody libraries approaching 10 11 independent clones. Selection is facilitated by display technologies that physically link a displayed antibody fragment to its cDNA in a defined particle such as a filamentous phage, a ribosome, or a cell. Millions to billions to, theoretically, trillions of independent particles constitute an antibody library that can be mined with antigens of interest. Particles that display antibody fragments with high affinity to the antigen are isolated. Because of the simultaneous isolation of their cDNA, the displayed antibody fragments can be copied, enabling multiple rounds of selection. In other words, the physical linkage of phenotype and genotype effectively links recognition and replication.

            "text": "Phage display is an antibody discovery tool that screens bacteriophage presenting a library of variable antibody domains against a target antigen. Through multiple rounds of incubation with the target, washing away unbound phage, and amplifying bound phage, the library is reduced to those clones with affinity and specificity to the antigen. 1,2 Individual clones can be selected or screened from this sublibrary and converted into an IgG format for use as diagnostic or therapeutic reagents.\n\nThough effective, traditional phage display suffers from key limitations. Conventionally, >5 rounds of selection are required to generate clones with high affinity to the target. The cost and time requirements of repeat rounds (approximately 6\u22128 weeks and $8,000\u221210,000 USD in total) are a bottleneck in the discovery of new therapeutics. 3,4 The difficulty in controlling stringency during binding causes many candidates from the enriched phage pools to represent false positives that fail in vitro validation. 5,6 An inability to recapitulate the low relative concentration and morphology of targets in vitro may also lead to candidates failing later during in vivo testing. 7 The stochastic nature of selection results in thousands of nonspecific clones, requiring further screening for elimination. Further, variations in the efficiency of bacterial amplification result in candidates being missed due to low representation. 8, 9 To address these issues, variations of the phage display approach have been developed. These include performing selection with antigens presented on a cell surface 10 and with mixed cell types, 11 incorporating microfluidics to control the binding dynamics, 12,13 and using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics analysis to choose clones for validation, to further library design, 14 or to eliminate nonspecific clones. 15 Although the feasibility of these approaches has been explored, a comprehensive platform combining these novel features to produce high-performing antibodies in a reduced number of rounds against a challenging therapeutic target has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nIn this paper, we present such a platform: \u03bcCellect.

Interestingly, further mutational studies on the DE loop of one particular high-affinity 10 Fn3 variant revealed that this loop can be either engineered to improve affinity or stability to a considerable degree. These results underline once more that library design for scaffolds based on immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains must undergo adjustments based both on the systematic evaluation of na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries and selection outputs in order to efficiently approach an optimum balance of stability and affinity of relevant variant proteins.\n\nThe degree of CDR sequence diversification in combinatorial libraries of antibody-based alternative scaffolds, i.e. the usage of the amino acid repertoire, follows various different strategies. While na\u20ac \u0131ve libraries provide natural diversity by combination of functional V-gene segments isolated from the lymphoid tissues of non-immunized donors [e.g. CAT 1.0 and CAT 2.0 libraries of Cambridge Antibody Technology (108,109)], synthetic libraries such as the HuCALs (Morphosys) offer any desired amino acid compositions in the CDRs (110,111). In general, it was observed that, despite the hypervariability of CDR sequences, there is a bias of functional CDRs to certain amino acid types, most of all tyrosine, glycine, and serine (112). Fellouse et al. showed that while scFv variants binding to some antigens at nanomolar affinities were selected from phage display libraries providing only a binary amino acid repertoire (i.e. tyrosine and serine), selections of binders from the same libraries to other antigens yielded affinities only in the micromolar range (113)(114)(115). Modifications of these libraries included an increased chemical diversity in CDR-H3 and the consideration of non-paratope residues potentially important for CDR conformation (116).\n\nAs mentioned above, Morphosys' HuCAL Fab",

            "text": "Phages are viruses that use their host bacterial cells as factories for their own replication and have the ability to display peptides or proteins on their surfaces. This technology is called phage display. Phage display can be used as a powerful tool to screen for affinity reagents for all kind of targets, ranging from small molecules to proteins and even cells. This selection can be performed by using phage libraries consisting of a high number of different phages (10 8 -10 10 ), each displaying a different peptide or protein on its surface. Among the huge number of phages in these phage libraries, the ones with high affinity and specificity for a target can be isolated in an affinity selection procedure (Fig. 1). Moreover, the proteins and peptides displayed on these selected phages can be identified by sequencing the gene coding for the displayed protein or peptide. This coding gene can be found in the singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) inside the selected phage. The target specific phages can be used as affinity reagents in diagnostic tests. Besides the target specific phages, the soluble peptides or proteins, released from the phage coat, can also be used as affinity reagents. These peptides or proteins are then produced synthetically or by recombinant expression in bacterial cells. Different types of phage libraries exist, displaying different types of peptides or proteins: peptides, cellular proteins (from cDNA libraries) or antibody fragments, like single chain variable fragments (scFv) and antigen binding fragment (Fab). Antibody fragment phage libraries are used commonly in immunology (Hoogenboom et al. 1998). Their wide diversity enables them to imitate the natural immune system. Phage display enables the production of sizeable amounts of the affinity reagents, avoiding the batch to batch variations which occur with classical antibodies. Moreover, there is no immune response required to produce affinity reagents for a target, making the selection of affinity reagents for poorly immunogenic targets possible. Peptide phage libraries can also be used to select affinity reagents, since the binding site, or epitope, only involves a few amino acids. Besides the monovalent phages that display one peptide on the phage surface, so-called landscape phages are also used as affinity reagents",

            "text": "The size and quality of diversity design and functional clones of the antibody library are crucial for the success of isolating potential therapeutic antibodies (20)(21)(22). A number of strategies have been undertaken to design and construct large antibody libraries with high functional diversity, which are comprised of the number of correctly assembled clones without frameshift or stop codons (23-25), such as by synthesizing CDR sequences employing the trinucleotide mutagenesis (TRIM) technology or selecting inframe antibody clones by antibiotic selection systems (15,19). The TRIM approach uses a set of pre-synthesized trinucleotide codon units instead of single nucleotides, thereby has the ability to synthesize desired compositions at each CDR found in natural human antibodies and avoid frameshifts or stop codons (26). To rapidly isolate human antibodies with therapeutic potential, we designed and constructed a highly diverse synthetic human scFv library with greater than a giga in size named DSyn-1. The library design was based on high stability scaffolds and six CDRs that were tailored to mimic natural human compositions for a lower risk of immunogenicity. In addition, to maximize the number of in-frame clones with high expression levels, the antibody sequences were codon-optimized and the six CDRs with various CDR-H3 lengths were subjected to b-lactamase selection. To evaluate the Dsyn-1 library, phage panning was performed against five therapeutically relevant antigens including one peptide. Furthermore, to evaluate the library's potential for biomedical research applications, we generated antibodies targeting the T cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3), which is a type I trans-membrane protein expressed on both adaptive and innate immune cells such as effector T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes (27,28). TIM-3 acts as an immune checkpoint inhibitor associated with anti-tumor immunity, and blockade of TIM-3 by antibodies has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment (29-31). In our library system, 204 unique antibodies recognizing TIM-3 were isolated and 25 were characterized via binding assays and in vitro analyses for inhibition ability.",

            "text": "Phage libraries derived from rearranged V-gene repertoires are created using mRNA or RNA isolated from B cells obtained from either immunized or na\u00efve donors. The construction process entails initially preparing the cDNA template through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, the repertoire of variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain genes is amplified via PCR before being cloned into the phagemid vector [22]. While phage display technology has been widely used for novel antibody development, it is noteworthy that there are different types of phage display libraries after many years of development. \n\nAs one of the first libraries constructed, scFv libraries are commonly used for antibody selection. They consist of antibody fragments that include the VH and VL chains linked by a flexible peptide linker. This format allows the expression of functional antigen-binding sites in a single polypeptide chain. For instance, the Tomlinson I and J libraries are wellknown scFv libraries derived from human germline sequences. They offer a diverse source of antibody fragments for various applications. Another well-known application is the selection of scFv antibodies against specific tumor antigens using phage display, as demonstrated by Lee et al. [23]. In contrast, Fab libraries display antibody fragments that consist of the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains, along with the constant regions of the heavy chain. Fabs maintain the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies while providing additional structural stability. The HuCAL (Human Combinatorial Antibody Library) Fab library is a widely used human-derived library for the generation of Fab fragments with therapeutic potential [24]. In addition, a study by Gram et al. utilized a Fab phage display library to isolate antibodies specific to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [25]. \n\nIn addition to the libraries from human and mice, single-domain antibody (nanobody) libraries have been derived from the variable domains of the heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids, such as llamas and camels. Renowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27].",

The construction of a high-quality antibody library, with larger and more diverse antibody repertoires, is essential for the successful development of phage display-derived mAbs. In this study, a large human combinatorial single-chain variable fragment library (1.5 \u00d7 1011 colonies) was constructed from Epstein\u2013Barr virus-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with a combination of two of the activators of human B cells, the Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist R848 and interleukin-2. Next-generation sequencing analysis with approximately 1.9 \u00d7 106 and 2.7 \u00d7 106 full-length sequences of heavy chain variable (VH) and \u03ba light chain variable (V\u03ba) domains, respectively, revealed that the library consists of unique VH (approximately 94%) and V\u03ba (approximately 91%) sequences with greater diversity than germline sequences. Lastly, multiple unique mAbs with high affinity and broad cross-species reactivity could be isolated from the library against two therapeutically relevant target antigens, validating the library quality. These findings suggest that the novel antibody library we have developed may be useful for the rapid development of target-specific phage display-derived recombinant human mAbs for use in therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

            "text": "The phage display technique consists of the expression of peptides, proteins, or antibody fragments on the surface of phage particles (56). The nucleotide sequence encoding the target protein is found in the phage genome fused to the gene sequence of a coat protein. This fusion ensures that during phage assembly, the target protein will be exposed on the surface of the mature phage while the sequence encoding it is contained in the same phage particle. Using phage display, the analysis of a library of nucleotide sequences with a diversity of millions or billions becomes the study of the corresponding population of exposed protein sequences that can be selected according to the desired properties. \n\nAnalysis of phage display libraries typically includes a panning selection step in which phage populations are exposed to the targets of interest to selectively capture the phages that have bound to them. Through successive rounds of binding, washing, elution, and amplification, the initial population made up of a great diversity of phages are enriched in those that can bind to the target in question. Since the phenotype of each protein carries its genotype inside the phage particle, once the proteins of interest have been isolated, the sequence encoding them can be easily determined and altered to manipulate or refine their binding properties. Currently, natural and synthetic peptides, proteins, and protein domains, as well as recombinant antibodies, are routinely expressed by phage display (56). The phage display technique constitutes a good system for the selection of antibodies or peptides with specific binding properties among a wide number of variants. \n\nNovel biomarkers can be identified by screening phage-display peptide libraries with sera from autoimmune disease patients. A complementary strategy is to construct a phage display library from B-cells from autoimmune disease patients to identify antibody sequences that recognize human epitopes.",

Theoretical and practical considerations would suggest that functional libraries should provide specific binders at the rate of approximately one binder per ten million clones. However, as libraries have grown exponentially larger, the number of isolated/identified binders has not increased correspondingly. By comparing the diversity of binders obtained from the same original na\u20ac \u0131ve antibody genetic material screened by: 1) phage display; 2) phage combined with yeast display; and 3) phage/yeast display with next-generation sequencing, this talk will illustrate how the diversity of isolated binders depends upon the screening/selection methods used. An alternative approach to traditional display technologies is the use of two hybrid methods, such as yeast two hybrid. Antonino Cattaneo (Scuola Normale Superiore) will describe the further development of this technology to select antibodies recognizing specific targets, particularly how it can be applied to the selection of antibodies against specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). This involves the anchored in vivo site-specific modification of a specific target, followed by the in vivo (yeast) selection of antibodies recognizing that modification. The selection of functional antibodies against acetylated and conformational targets will be described. One important advantage of this technique is that selected antibodies are functional within the cytoplasm. As a result, in addition to being able to inhibit PTM activity, selected antibodies tend to be particularly stable. \n\nThe B cell is the perfect display platform, providing both amplification and simultaneous affinity maturation upon immunization. However, it can be challenging to access the naturally paired genes underlying B cell responses to target. While rodents yield hybridomas relatively easily, this is not the case for humans.",

            "text": "Library design, construction and characterization. To generate a large, stable and highly diverse library of functional antibody fragments with similar physical properties, we cloned a synthetic antibody library in a phagemid vector. Sequence diversity was restricted to the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 loops of the variable heavy (VH) and light chain (VL) domains (Fig. 1A). The scFv format was selected because it provides better expression yields and superior phage display properties compared with the Fab format. The scFv antibody scaffold used for the library was based on the germline VH segment DP47 and either the V\u03ba segment DPK22 or the V\u03bb segment DPL16 (Fig. 1B), which represent 12, 25 and 16%, of the antibody repertoire in humans, respectively. 6 This approach offers a number of advantages, e.g., higher thermodynamic stability, 37 possible use of Protein A for antibody purification and detection. 4 Sequence randomization was limited to the CDR3 loops, which are known to contribute substantially to antigen recognition (Fig. 1). A completely randomized sequence of four, five, six or seven amino acid residues (followed by the conserved Phe-Asp-Tyr sequence) was appended by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the VH germline segment (Table 1), thus forming short CDR3 loops, whereas a partially randomized sequence of six amino acid residues was appended to the VL, forming CDR3 loops that contained at least one proline residue (Table 1). The flexible polypeptide Gly 4 SerGly 4 SerGly 4 , 38 was used to link the VH chain to the VL chain in the scFv fragments. Additionally, residue 52 in the CDR2 loop of the VH domain was allowed to be either two charged amino acids (Asp, Lys in PHILO1 sub-library) or two hydrogen bond-prone amino acids (Asn, Tyr in PHILO2 sub-library). The sub-libraries could be used together by mixing the corresponding phage preparations, resulting in the PHILO library, which contained 3.1 x 10 9 different antibody clones.",

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B.

The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency.",

In the current study, we performed a comparative analysis of the compositional features in different lots of the same na\u00efve phage display library and monitored alterations in their peptide compositions during three rounds of amplification. Methods We conducted three rounds of duplicate serial amplification of two different lots of the Ph.D.\u2122-12 phage display library. DNA from the samples was subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) using an Illumina platform. The NGS datasets underwent a variety of bioinformatic analyses using Python and MATLAB scripts. Results We observed substantial heterogeneity in the sequence composition of the two lots indicated by differences in the enhanced percentage of wildtype clones, reduced diversity (number of unique sequences), and increased enrichment factors (EFs) during amplification as well as by observing no common sequence between lots and decreased number of common sequences between the na\u00efve library and the consecutive rounds of amplification for each lot. We also found potential propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) with the highest EFs in the two lots, which were displayed by the fastest-propagating phage clones. Furthermore, motif analysis of the most enriched subpopulation of amplified libraries led to the identification of some motifs hypothesized to contribute to the increased amplification rates of the respective phage clones. Conclusion Our results highlight tremendous heterogeneity in the peptide composition of different lots of the same type of na\u00efve phage display library, and the divergent evolution of their compositional features during amplification rounds at the amino acid, peptide, and motif levels. Our findings can be instrumental for phage display researchers by bringing fundamental insights into the vast extent of non-uniformity between phage display libraries and by providing a clear picture of how these discrepancies can lead to different evolutionary fates for the peptide composition of phage pools, which can have profound impacts on the outcome of phage display selections through biopanning.

Smith's discovery of a method to engineer and display peptides on bacteriophages in 1985 revolutionized the discovery of bioactive peptides and proteins. 131 Significant progress continues to be made in this field today. 132,133 Since phenotype is directly related to the genotype of peptide, protein, and antibody proteins, the ability to construct and screen vast libraries of these motifs has enabled the rapid identification of active peptide sequences. This is the result of significant advances in antibody research, which have become a necessary prerequisite for antibody discovery. 134,135 Phage display has proven to be a valuable method for the generation and optimization of peptide ligands and is used to discover lead peptides targeting a wide range of biological substrates. 133 Technology is increasing the efficiency of these techniques and their applicability to an increasingly broad range of targets. High-throughput sequencing techniques are being used to significantly impact traditional screening protocols such as panning or searching for peptide binders for a given target. The use of new technologies is creating more effective screening paradigms that allow access to vast amounts of sequence data from just one round of screening or panning. 136 Thanks to this information, a much more efficient screening and library synthesis approach can be applied during affinity maturation, allowing the simultaneous synthesis of much larger structures and potent binders. A collection of early panning activity. By limiting the frequency of phage panning cycles, we can also prevent biased selection of reproducible phage clones. As a result, the number of \"parasitic\" sequences increases rapidly, making it extremely difficult to identify peptides that have a true preference for specific targets. 137 Display systems include mRNA, DNA, ribosome, phage, and yeast displays. They play an important role in modern peptide drug discovery. By integrating phenotype and genotype, affinity selection can be achieved at the peptide level. DNA can then be recovered and amplified by either PCR or phage infection.\n\nPhage display is one of the oldest techniques. 131 Up to 1010 unique peptides can be produced using this system.

            "text": "The first natural naive phage antibody library described 1 was generated from two donors and was successfully used to select antibodies against a number of different targets, albeit with rather poor affinities. Since then, the general tendency has been to try and use as many donors as possible to maximize the library diversity 63 , based on the idea that the immune repertoire, in terms of germline IG loci, varies across human individuals and ethnicities, and this might influence and vary the quality of antibody responses, for instance during exposure to vaccination and disease. For this reason, there has been a tendency to generate libraries from more and more donors, with the idea that such libraries provide both quantitative (more antibodies) and qualitative (antibodies for a wide range of antigen and/or with potential better affinity) advantages. \n\nHere we show that a library carefully crafted from a single donor provides sufficient diversity to select hundreds of antibodies against different targets, notwithstanding the presence of a higher level of clonal dominance when compared to libraries created from multiple donors 22,27 . The disadvantages of such clonal dominance may be offset by a greater percentage of natural IGHV/IGLV and IGHV/IGKV pairings in single-, as compared to multi-, donor libraries, claimed to be advantageous in immune libraries 64 . However, whether the numbers of natively paired antibodies present in a single donor are significant, or indeed relevant, to large naive antibody libraries, remains unclear. \n\nAntibody recognition of a given epitope is mediated by the three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of each of the heavy and light chains (6 CDRs total). IGHV diversity is generated by the sequential random assembly of ~50 IGHV, 23 IGHV-D, and 6 IGHV-J genes [65][66][67][68] , with the IGHV-D forming the central core of the binding site.",

            "text": "This highlights an unmet medical need for identifying novel targets and the development of efficient treatments for MM patients. \n\nPhage display is a valuable technique to isolate antibodies against target structures on cell surface of tumor cells, which might have potential as new immunotherapeutic agents. In this regard, cellular panning approaches were already successfully used to identify novel antibodies targeting so far unknown tumor-associated antigens like the C-type lectin-like molecule-1 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells or tumor-specific peptides of oncogenes (RAS and TP53) presented on human leukocyte antigens (HLA) (8)(9)(10). Using phage display, antibodies can be selected from synthetic, semi-synthetic, na\u00efve or immune libraries. To enable identification of antibodies with desired binding properties, synthetic, semi-synthetic and na\u00efve libraries have to be very large to achieve the required high initial diversity. For instance, the na\u00efve human antibody libraries HAL9/10, the semi-synthetic n-CoDeR and the synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM libraries have theoretical diversities of 1.5 x 10 10 , 2 x 10 9 and 4.5 x 10 10 clones, respectively (11)(12)(13). Although specific binders can be isolated, additional in vitro affinity maturations can become necessary to generate high-affinity binders from these types of libraries (14). Since immune libraries are generated from immunized individuals, the embodied antibodies already passed affinity maturation, increasing the possibility to identify specific and high-affinity antibodies (15)(16)(17). Blood, BM, lymphoid organs or spleens containing plasma or B cells can be used to generate immune libraries. Of note, utilization of spleens from immunized mice for immune phage library generation is thereby as efficient as using mouse BM plasma cells for antibody discovery (18). \n\nToday, the combination of phage display and next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows deep evaluation of newly generated antibody libraries and monitoring of panning processes. By using modern NGS platforms, several millions of variable (V) regions defining the binding specificity of an antibody can be sequenced simultaneously and potentially cover all antibodies present within an antibody library.",

            "text": "Combining cell surface-specific markers of parasitic infections with phage antibody libraries ultimately screens peptide compounds for the development of anti-parasitic drugs (Kuzmicheva & Belyavskaya, 2016). Furthermore, Henry & Debarbieux (2012) suggested that phages will reduce the production of pathogens in food, effectively reducing losses in the food industry. Now, many phage display antibodies have entered the biopharmaceutical market. Phage display technology played an important role in drug discovery and development, and many phage molecules have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and many phage molecules have entered clinical trials. We can expect even greater improvements in the near future, and phage display will bring more contributions to oncology. An ideal scFv library should produce a diverse range of scFvs with high specificity and high affinity. The size of the scFv library capacity determine the ability to screen for scFvs that bind to specific antigens. In general, the larger the library capacity, the higher the likelihood of screening for affinity scFvs will be. Several factors determine scFv library capacity (e.g., the number of scFv genes, the efficiency of ligation, the efficiency of transformation into host bacteria for amplification and the efficiency of using phage infestation). The proportion of open reading frames is increased by reducing base mutations, frame displacement, and so forth to establish a big capacity antibody library (Ling, 2003). Currently phage display technology is one of the most convenient and most general used methods. This method exhibits a short experimental cycle and achieve favorable infiltration results. The capacity of the phage-infested antibody library is approximately twice that of the original antibody library. In general, the capacity of theoretical antibody library is about 1 \u00d7 10 7\u22128 pfu/mL, whereas the phage-infested antibody library can reach 1 \u00d7 10 11-13 pfu/mL (Wang et al., 2021). Indeed, there are some shortcomings in phage display single chain antibody libraries (e.g., the low efficiency of phage infestation, the large number of false positive clones, and the high duplication rate of scFv genes in scFv libraries) (Willats, 2002).",

            "text": "high affinity and specificity, which could be improved to produce new therapeutic molecules [12].\n\nHowever, phage display technology has several potential drawbacks that must be taken into account [2]. Clones may be toxic or may reduce phage infectivity and secretion or bacterial growth. Such clones are unlikely to be selected and are therefore likely to disappear rapidly from the library, regardless of the selection process. In addition, the level of expression of certain peptide sequences in E. coli is variable (depending on codon usage), introducing another potential bias into the selection process [41]. Finally, successive amplifications of the library may rapidly decrease the diversity of the library, because the clones with a growth advantage are likely to increase significantly within the population, at the expense of other clones. It has been shown that lower affinity clones may be isolated more efficiently than high-affinity clones during the selection steps in some cases [42]. This phenomenon has mostly been reported with antibody libraries, but may also operate in the case of antiviral molecules from combinatorial peptide libraries. The factors involved are not yet understood but may be related to the protein/peptide sequences displayed, affecting the efficiency of expression and/or being toxic for E. coli. Thus, selection may be dependent on the production of a less toxic phage-peptide and/or favored expression, rather than just the optimization of phage-peptide affinity for the target [43]. In addition, peptide motifs, such as those rich in hydrophobic residues, may interact non specifically with any molecule or surface present during experimental selection (plastic solid phase, for example) [44]. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the selected peptides, once synthesized as soluble compounds, may not retain their optimal activity outside the microenvironment of the phage and/or in the complicated environment of a living cell or animal [25].",

            "text": "The current study describes a method to rapidly produce phage display libraries using a one-step whole-plasmid PCR method to seamlessly introduce a region of high diversity. This was demonstrated for a 16mer peptide library displayed near the N-terminus of the pVIII protein and also for three VHH libraries where diversity was introduced within the CDR3 region. The method utilises a type IIS restriction enzyme cleavage site for seamless cloning of the insert and so the insertion site is completely adaptable for insertion at any site and within any ligand scaffold. The library diversity was reproducibly ~ 1 \u00d7 10 9 from 10 transformations using ~ 1 \u03bcg of ligated DNA. This is a relatively simple method that produces diversity comparable to other established methods that often rely on multiple PCR steps and multiple restriction enzyme cleavage steps of both inserts and vectors before ligation, and the availability of multiple cloning sites in the vector [10,11]. For antibody diversity, only a single VHH CDR was mutated by this method but iterative mutagenesis of other CDRs could be achieved by the same method. Alternatively, binders could be obtained from a CDR3 mutated library and affinity matured, if required, by the introduction of further diversity into CDR1 and/or CDR2 using the same method and the lead candidate(s) as the template.\n\nThe libraries were characterised by NGS analysis which described the extent of bias for peptide sequences within the The heat map shows the percentage difference in the display fre-quency from the theoretical value (a). Similarly, bias for each amino acid was determined for each position within the areas of diversity (b to e, for the PC89 pVIII-16mer, pSD pIII-VHH_12mer, pSD pIII-VHH_16mer and pSD pIII-VHH_21mer libraries, respectively) region of diversity after propagation in bacteria but before display on phage. All libraries contained overrepresented sequences, as has previously been reported for both peptide and antibody libraries [12,34,35].

            "text": "approach, epitope phage display libraries from specific regions of the human genome were enriched for coding exon sequences that bind to target proteins (i.e., antibodies). The approach was designed to maximize library diversity and the likelihood of exon display, and to minimize sequence space devoted to introns and stop codons. The intron-exon pattern of gene structure dictates that epitopes generated from genomic fragments will encode primarily linear, small exon-specific epitopes. For example, in silico sequence analyses of the 5q31 Interleukin gene region indicate that the majority of the exons within this region range between 100-300 bp (http://www.lbnl.gov/lifesciences). Variables related to genomic sequence, such as size of the target region (kilobase, megabase, etc.), gene location within six reading frames, stop codon frequency and in-frame sequences are important considerations in developing phage display-based coding exon identification. In addition, proper cloning orientation is required for successful pIII phage display. An insert sequence must be in-frame relative to the leader sequence and continue in-frame into the pIII sequence [3]. A stop codon within the insert sequence will cause a premature truncation of the peptide and prevent surface display. We used size selection strategies to optimize exon display from genomic fragments, derived from a 50 kb human P1 artificial chromosome, containing genes from the 5q31 Interleukin gene cluster. An epitope library from breast cancer cell cDNA was also was evaluated for gene specific protein-protein interactions.\n\nThe success and challenges of creating and screening epitope display libraries from large genomic fragments and cDNAs are discussed.",

            "text": "Beyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.",

However, one VH (DP47) and one Vk (DPK22) dominate the functional repertoire (37) and are well represented in binders isolated from synthetic phage libraries (10). Because our purpose was to generate a highly diverse library of functional antibodies with similar expression and performance, we opted to utilize only these two germ line gene segments, whereas randomizing four amino acid residues in the VL CDR3 (positions 91, 93, 94, and 96) and four residues in the VH CDR3 (positions 95-98; Fig. 1), in accordance with their role as common antigen contacts (38). \n\nLike Hoogenboom and Winter (23) we did not randomize the structurally relevant and biologically conserved F-D-Y sequence at the end of the CDR3 VH (Fig. 1; Table I).

            "text": "The shorter CDR-H3s of six amino acid length were fully randomized, whereas for the longer CDR-H3s the design included a stretch of fully randomized amino acid residues flanked by regions of lower diversity resembling human antibody sequences [56]. \n\nWhile specific antibody fragments to both haptens and protein antigens could be selected from the smallest libraries, affinities were very moderate [79]. A strong bias towards the VH3 framework was observed. Using a ten times larger library, scFvs against 18 different antigens were selected [55]. All VH families except VH2 were found, but VH3 was strongly overrepresented. The large semi-synthetic library constructed by Griffiths and coworkers yielded even higher hit-rates of unique, specific clones after selection [62]. The resulting antibodies represented 17/49 VH fragments, 10/26 V_kappa segments and 9/21 V_lambda segments, including all of the major families. Fifty two different heavy/light chain pairings were identified, with several VH genes being promiscuous. Affinities of purified Fabs ranged from 3.8 to 217 nM (antigens: NIP-CAP, fluorescein, HGF/SF, NML1, NML9), showing that high affinities can be achieved with a large library. \n\nAccumulating results from selections done with the early libraries confirm the expectation that larger libraries yield more specific antibodies with higher average affinities. A second observation is that certain frameworks (predominantly VH1 and VH3) are over represented after selection by phage display, often beyond the ratio that can be expected from the input libraries. This observation, together with the desire to increase functional library size led to the development of single acceptor framework libraries. VH and VL frameworks were chosen based on the frequency of use and for their favorable stability and/or expression properties [57,63]. \n\nLibraries that are based on a single framework combination almost exclusively use the heavy chain framework VH3_23, a framework that is frequently found in human antibodies, pairs with almost all light chains, shows a good expression in bacteria and displays well on phages.",

            "text": "The method consists of building a library (left panel) of peptide or protein variants-or in the case of antibodies, an antibody gene repertoire-and affinity selecting (right panel) specific antibody-phage fusions via affinity with the target of interest. An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. Alternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16]. \n\nInitially, the main goal of phage display antibody discovery campaigns was to select for specific and high affinity antibodies [17]. In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials.",

            "text": "Phage display technology is proven to be extremely practical for engineering antibody libraries. It provides a powerful tool for the high-throughput generation of affinity antibodies using an easy procedure. However, the antibody conformation may be altered during the panning process. Thus, constructing a phage library with larger capacity and diversity is necessary for the screening of specific antibodies, which largely depends on the quality of the constructed antibody library [27,28]. \n\nPrevious studies constructed phage libraries directly from PBMCs of patients with HFRS. In our study, we enriched B cells from PBMCs by transforming PBMCs to BLCLs. Although EBV-transformed human BLCLs can secrete some human antibodies, the amount of secreted antibodies is small, and their quality is unstable, which creates difficulties in the preparation and acquisition of antibodies that result in limited clinical application prospects [22]. Unlike the natural phage antibody libraries, which are derived from unimmunized human or animal B lymphocytes, phage immune antibody libraries prepared from B lymphocytes of immunized humans or animals have no requirement for a large library capacity to obtain specific antibodies. Hence, we used BLCLs from 35 Nab-positive patients with HFRS and vaccinated people to construct the human immune antibody library and, thereby, ensure the diversity of antibody gene sources. During the construction of a phage antibody library, the capacity of the antibody library should exceed 10 14 if all highly diverse VH and VL domains are randomly paired. However, it is reported that the capacity of antibody libraries is typically between 10 4 and 10 9 [29]. The next important step is to amplify as many antibody genes as possible to increase the library capacity and maintain diversity. \n\nThe amplified VH, VL, CL and CH1 domains were assembled into Fab fragments, which were cloned into the phage expression vector pHIAT 3 (Figure S2). E. coli TG1 was transformed via electroporation, and the number of clones was calculated to construct a human Fab phage antibody gene library with a library capacity of 1.3 \u00d7 10 9 . The primary phage antibody library had a titer of 1.0 \u00d7 10 13 PFU/mL.",

From analysis of abundant sequences, Rodi and Makowski developed a method that calculated the probability (p) of finding a specific sequences in the original library [98].They hypothesized that peptides of low information, orln(p) are common in the library, and are more likely to be present in the screen due to growth advantage.Those with high information are more likely to be selected due to panning [24].Analysis of the information content of the peptide, hence, can be used to identify phage clones that were selected due to growth preferences [88,99].",

After multiple rounds of binding selection, ELISA analysis confirmed the high affinity and specificity of the isolated clones for ETX. In a recent study, Shadman et al. (131) successfully identified novel single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against the pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A domain I (ExoA-DI) from a human scFv phage library. To achieve this, the recombinant ExoA-DI of pseudomonas aeruginosa was expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified using a Ni-NTA column for the screening process of the human antibody phage library. \n\nThe development of recombinant antibodies against toxins through phage display technology presents a promising avenue for diagnosing and treating infections. The screening of human antibody phage libraries allows for the discovery of antibodies from naive antibody gene banks, which in turn can be utilized to create novel therapeutic agents targeting toxin-related diseases. A new screening procedure has been devised to prevent the elimination of rare specific clones, enabling the identification of highly reactive phage clones. In the case of exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the purified scFv antibodies demonstrated remarkable specificity and reactivity with both the recombinant domain I and the full-length natural exotoxin A. This exciting finding lays the foundation for the potential development of new therapeutic agents to combat pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Altogether, phage display technology represents a powerful tool for the development of recombinant antibodies against toxins, revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases (132,133).",

To extend the technique to the expression and selection of antibody libraries in an eukaryotic environment, we provide here a proof of concept that retroviruses can be engineered for the display and selection of variable single-chain fragment (scFv) libraries. A retroviral library displaying the repertoire obtained after a single round of selection of a human synthetic scFv phage display library on laminin was generated. For selection, antigen-bound virus was efficiently recovered by an overlay with cells permissive for infection. This approach allowed more than 103-fold enrichment of antigen binders in a single selection cycle. After three selection cycles, several scFvs were recovered showing similar laminin-binding activities but improved expression levels in mammalian cells as compared with a laminin-specific scFv selected by the conventional phage display approach. Thus, translational problems that occur when phage-selected antibodies have to be transferred onto mammalian expression systems to exert their therapeutic potential can be avoided by the use of retroviral display libraries.",

            "text": "We have compared the abilities of two types of antibody phage display libraries, synthetic scFv and natural non-immune Fab libraries, to rapidly produce useful diagnostic antibodies. Both libraries have wide diversity estimated at greater than 10 9 individual clones, which in previous instances have been shown to give multiple high affinity antibodies against a variety of antigens (Griffiths et al., 1994;de Haard et al., 1999;Goletz et al., 2002). The polyclonal ELISA demonstrated a clear pattern of enrichment for both scFv and Fab libraries against both target antigens and resulted in a significant percentage of positive clones. \n\nHowever, our screening of the scFv library indicated a high percentage of clones that contained amber stops within the CDRs. The presence of amber stop codons has been reported previously in various studies utilizing the Tomlinson I and J libraries (Hirose et al., 1998;Yan et al., 2004;Martinez-Torrecuadrada et al., 2005;Marcus et al., 2006). While this may be attributed to the use of random base insertion during the construction of the semisynthetic library, the percentage of clones containing the amber stop codon appears disproportionally high. The exact reason for this observation is unclear. However, it has been shown that when using suppressor strains such as TG1, the presence of amber stop codons reduces expression (Oh et al., 2007). If expression of the antibody-gIII fusion protein is toxic to the bacteria, selection for clones with reduced expression of this protein may occur, increasing the likelihood for the selection of clones with amber stop codon as opposed to those with the corresponding classical glutamic acid codon. \n\nWhile this problem is correctable by DNA mutagenesis techniques and suitable for expressing and analyzing a few high affinity antibodies (Marcus et al., 2006), the large number that would have to be processed in order to have a wide range of antibodies targeting different epitopes, as required in this study Signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the absorbance at the particular antigen concentration over the absorbance at 0 ng/ml concentration of antigen. \n\nfor rapid discovery of suitable antibody pairs, render this procedure impractical.",

L3 length varies from four to six residues. In H3, the loop lengths range from 6 and 20 residues (sub library A), 7 and 15 residues (sub library B) or 6 and 17 residues (sub libraries C and D). H3 design in the most complex sub library D (6 to 17 residues) was based on a tailored oligonucleotide synthesis strategy that biased the sequences in favor of Y, S and G but allowed for 19 of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (only C was exclud ed) and potentiated high level of diversity amongst the H3 loops in terms of both length and sequence.

            "text": "When using invitro display, one of the concerns is that the total diversity of antibodies found in these libraries may not be fully tapped during selections. Theoretical 5 and experimental 6,7 assessments indicate that one would expect to recover thousands of different antibodies from a10 8 diversity library, and yet, unless heroic efforts are made, 8 the number of antibodies identified is usually less than 50. This is mainly due to two factors:1) many antibody libraries are not as diverse as indicated by the number of transformants, 9,10 and2) the way potential binders are traditionally screened identifies leads after extensive individual clone screening, an inefficient approach vexed by the redundancy of abundant clones, and sparse, or absent, representation of most clones that occur in lower frequencies within the selected population. Moreover, clones with high binding activity, or with other prominent functional properties, can be found within the lower frequency clone population. Their rarity can be explained by lower expression levels in aprokaryotic system, or by more general biases resulting from the biopanning process. 11 An alternative approach is to use next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has massively increased the capacity to sequence millions of clones in avery fast and inexpensive way, 12 revolutionizing several aspects of biological research, including invitro and invivo antibody selections. 10,13 e routinely use an approach that exploits NGS in invitro display selection analyses. By combining phage display, yeast display, and NGS, we have shown that the number of identified antibodies can exceed 1,000, 10,14,15 reflecting the far deeper sampling that NGS provides: millions of reads, rather than hundreds of microtiter plate wells screened. This is particularly true if there is bias in the selected population, which is often the case. However, unless antibodies identified by NGS can be easily produced as clones for further analysis, their specificities and properties cannot be assessed, leaving uncertain the true breadth of available reactivities, and risking the loss of many potentially valuable antibodies. The greater the number of different antibodies available, the greater the number of different epitopes, and consequently biological activities, that can be targeted. The caveat of NGS sequencing is that after identifying the desired sequences, one does not have the isolated clones in hand.",

            "text": "We report the design, construction, and use of the first very large non-immunized phage antibody library in Fab format, which allows the rapid isolation and affinity analysis of antigen-specific human antibody fragments. Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response. This new phage antibody library is set to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets, and to play a vital role in target discovery and validation in the area of functional genomics.",

            "text": "multidrug-resistant organisms has spurred the need to develop alternate strategies to the standard antibiotics therapy regime. One such strategy is the use of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can function both in a prophylactic and therapeutic manner [1]. The breadth of mAb application in this area has seen a rapid increase of mAb trials over the past decade for a wide range of pathologies including infectious diseases [2]. The development of antibody display technologies such as phage display [3][4][5], yeast display [6], mRNA display [7], ribosome display [8], bacterial display [9][10][11] and mammalian cell surface display [12] have aided the rapid development of new mAbs. The basic principle of these in vitro selection technologies stems from the physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody genes) tethered to the carrier particle [13]. Even with the availability of different display methods, phage display is widely regarded as the preferred approach for antibody display.\n\nThe general requirement for a successful mAb selection process is the existence of a diverse combinatorial repertoire of antibody genes from which to select. This collection of antibody genes is commonly referred to as an antibody library [14]. Antibody libraries can be distinguished by the source of antibody genes used for display. This ranges from na\u00efve (healthy individuals), immune (infected or immunized individuals), synthetic (chemically synthesized) and semi-synthetic (a mixture of natural immune and chemically synthesized genes) libraries [14][15][16]. The development of human antibody libraries requires B-cells obtained from human donors which sometimes represents a bottleneck due to the specific characteristics of the samples needed such as source of the B-cells, and the strict regulation in terms of human biological samples usage in research. Apart from humans, animals are also a valuable source of B-cells for antibody library generation. In the context of infectious diseases, immune libraries are very attractive options as they are designed to mirror the immune response of an infected individual or immunized animal, reflecting the biased repertoire of antibody genes specific to that infection. This is only true in the case where the B-cells can elicit an immune response to the infection. Therefore, the nature of the immune response to",

            "text": "Renowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27]. One remarkable feature of nanobodies is their compact size, comprising only the variable domain without the additional heavy or light chains. This simplicity grants nanobodies several advantages, including enhanced tissue penetration, increased stability, and the ability to recognize cryptic epitopes that might be challenging for larger antibodies. The absence of a light chain also simplifies production and engineering processes. The selection process from nanobody libraries often involves immunizing animals with the target antigen of interest, followed by the generation of the library and subsequent panning against the antigen. Additionally, synthetic or na\u00efve nanobody libraries can be created without prior immunization, providing a valuable resource for discovering binders against a wide range of targets [28]. \n\nIn addition, chimeric phage display libraries are a hybrid class of libraries that incorporate genetic material from multiple sources, combining elements to enhance the diversity and functionality of displayed peptides or proteins. The construction of chimeric libraries involves the fusion of genetic sequences derived from different antibody fragments or protein domains, resulting in a mosaic-like collection of variants presented on the surface of bacteriophages [29]. These libraries aim to harness the strengths of different antibody formats or functional domains to create molecules with optimized properties. One common strategy for constructing chimeric libraries is the fusion of variable regions from human antibodies with constant regions from non-human sources, such as mice. This chimerization process seeks to retain the specificity and affinity of human antibodies while benefiting from the stability and expression advantages offered by non-human constant regions. Chimeric libraries can also be generated by combining variable domains from different antibodies, allowing for the exploration of diverse binding specificities within a single library [30]. \n\nIn another way, phage display antibody libraries can be classified into four distinct types based on the origin of their sequences: naive, immune, semi-synthetic, and synthetic libraries [31,32]. Naive libraries, sourced from natural entities such as primary B-cells of non-immunized donors, harness naturally rearranged variable region genes. With extensive repertoires reaching up to 10 11 members, naive libraries have the capacity to generate antibodies targeting a diverse array of antigens.",

            "text": "The major challenge is isolating target-specific VHH antibodies through conventional screening of phage libraries, using phage ELISA or phage-binding analysis. Conventional screening requires the use of thousands of library clones and generates a monoclonal phage for binding analysis, which is very laborious, time-consuming, and expensive [17]. In addition, hetero-immunized library genes could be stimulated by multiple responses, due to shared antigenic determinants, with multiple VHH antibodies [18]. To isolate mono-specific antibodies, comparative binding analysis is necessary. Therefore, we searched for an alternative antibody screening strategy and found that a high-throughput sequencing-based strategy is an ideal approach for screening antibody candidates from a diverse gene library using machine-learning informatics. High-throughput sequencing via next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for analyzing a large number of DNA sequences with many evolutionary aspects of phage libraries within a short time frame, including the identification of unique and/or low-frequency rare clones that could be missed by conventional isolation techniques [14,19,20]. In principle, NGS-generated reads are used to determine the enrichment folds of each sequence by comparing them before and after panning of the phage library. High amplification folds indicated that the number of identified reads had increased compared to the number in the previous selection rounds. Diversified NGS-generated sequences can be grouped according to evolutionary relationships by a phylogenetic tree that provides a highly homologous cluster of genes derived from one or a group of species [21,22]. The phylogenetic tree-generated cluster would contain homologous character populations that share a recent common ancestor. Based on this principle, we searched monoclonal VHH antibodies from multiple tumor cells immunized phage display library. \n\nIn the current study, we aimed to develop a tumor-specific VHH antibody screening method to screen multiple tumor cell-immunized libraries, using high-throughput sequencing, which will help us to identify antibody candidates.",

            "text": "The fully human scFv phage display library holds great value for the development of antibody-based treatments. The construction of a human scFv library is theoretically simple, but a high-quality library is difficult to obtain. There are three main indexes used to evaluate the quality of a phage display library, including gene diversity, library size and screening ability. In the present study, these three key indexes were used to optimize the construction of the human scFv library. A total of 400 blood, 30 bone marrow and 10 cord blood samples were collected from healthy donors. donors were recruited via different sources to avoid the bias of individual antibody genes, and to ensure the diversity of the scFv gene. The scFv gene was amplified in strict accordance with the proportion of antibody genes of different human germlines, and imitated the human antibody gene repertoire to the maximal extent. The results of randomly sequencing 60 scFvs revealed that the diversity of the constructed phage display library was consistent with the antibody gene distribution of the human germline. \n\nThe simplest way to evaluate the quality of an antibody library is by size. Theoretically, the larger the capacity of the library, the higher the affinity of the screened antibodies. \n\nThe key factors that affect antibody library size are primarily the efficiencies of gene splicing and electrotransformation. Splicing of antibody light and heavy chain genes is generally conducted by overlap PcR. After a long period of investigation, the optimal protocol and conditions for overlap PcR amplification were determined. A primary human scFv library (5x10 7 in size) was constructed from peripheral and cord blood samples, and a primary human scFv library (5x10 7 in size) was  constructed using bone marrow samples. By optimizing the recombinant conditions, the primary library was used to infect the BS1365 E. coli strain, which expresses the cre enzyme. Using cre-LoxP enzyme-mediated heavy and light chain replacement recombination, a recombinant human scFv phage display library with a library size of 1x10 11 was obtained. The most important parameter for antibody library quality is the ability to screen antibodies.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, different surface platforms, e.g., mammalian cell display, ribosome display, yeast display, and phage display, are used for screening recombinant antibody libraries and each has different advantages and disadvantages (48,89). The common method used in different platforms is the same for displaying the libraries and contains several rounds of screening for selecting specific antibodies (48). The main differences in platforms are related to the differences in the diversity of libraries, different efficiencies in screening, and the possibility of antibody maturation (48). In particular, yeast and mammalian displays can increase the affinity maturation of antibodies due to the ability of post-translational modifications in displayed fragments (48,89,125). Moreover, the main advantage of these platforms is their compatibility with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), leading to precise control over screening and selecting high-affinity antibodies, which bind specifically to the targeted antigen (125,126). However, multivalent binding has been reported as a significant drawback of yeast or mammalian cell platforms because of the presence of antibody density on their cell surfaces. This disadvantage allows for isolating antibodies with lower affinity compared to monovalent techniques, e.g., phage display (48). Additionally, the construction of large libraries is challenging in these platforms, as far as the number of unique antibody copies in the yeast or mammalian libraries is several orders of magnitude lower than in phage libraries, leading to the selection of few candidates in the panning process (89,127).\n\nThe phage, ribosome, and bacterial display libraries have been constructed with more than 10 11 clones, allowing for the generation and screening of a huge diversity of clones (48,86,128). Antibody expression in these systems, especially in phage display, is considered a straightforward process with many advantages (95, 96). Moreover, since gene manipulation in these platforms is easy, the generation of antibodies with higher affinity and specificity is more feasible than other recombinant technologies (49,129). Notably, over the past decades, phage display has been the most widely used system for the production of rAbs and was awarded 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Application of phage antibody libraries has been reported for identification of various targets, including haptens, and foreign",

In this report, we analyzed diversity of amplified libraries using Illumina and observed a collapse of diversity in phage-displayed libraries after a single round of growth in bacteria. The collapse of the 10 6 -scale library to a few hundred abundant sequences would not be visible in small-scale Sanger sequencing [17,20,21]; it could also have been difficult to detect with smaller-throughput 454 Sequencing. \n\nCharacterization of sequence diversity is important for phage display technology, which has been used in over 5000 publications and patents in the past 20 years. It has enabled the discovery of ligands for hundreds of targets, yet the literature still contains several poorly-explained observations: (1) identical sequences could emerge from unrelated screens for unrelated target [22,23], and (2) screens that should yield a large number of diverse ligand often yield only one sequence motif (reviewed in [16]). The nearly complete sequence coverage of libraries illuminates the origin of these observations. It highlights that the collapse of diversity in amplification might be one of the major limitations of phage-display technology. Deep-sequencing analysis will make it possible to bypass problems originating from the unwanted collapse of diversity [11]. \n\nLarge-scale analysis could also help developing methods that preserve diversity of peptide libraries [24,25]. It can be used to enable discoveries of ligands that previously have been lost in phage display screens.",

            "text": "In vitro display technology is the selection of DNA-binding proteins or antibodies based on the directed evolution approach [36]. In the field of antibody discovery, it mimics the in vivo process of antibody generation and has four main characteristics: (1) the generation of the genotypic diversity by library construction, (2) the linkage between the genotype and the phenotype, (3) the recovery of the DNA sequence encoding the selected antibody and finally (4) the antibody amplification. The isolated clones can be expressed to be characterized and the best candidates are selected [14] (Figure 1C). Further characterizations can be performed by IgG production in mammalian cells. Antibody libraries can be derived from either non-immunized (na\u00efve and synthetic) or immunized donors. Na\u00efve libraries should have high diversity, but the selected clones may not have high affinity. On the other hand, libraries from immunized donors have a lower diversity with higher affinity candidates [37,38]. \n\nThe main advantage of this technology is the capability to select antibodies against a wide range of targets and epitopes since the selection from a na\u00efve or synthetic antibody repertoire does not rely on an in vivo immune response. Thus, the isolation of antibodies targeting even self-antigens and toxic, unstable, and non-immunogenic antigens is possible using the library from non-immunized donors [14]. \n\nPhage, yeast and mammalian cell surface displays are examples of in vitro display technologies to select antibody fragments such as the single-chain variable fragment (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and single-domain antibody (sdAb) [37][38][39]. \n\nPhage display was the first technology developed to select exogenous peptides on the filamentous M13 bacteriophage (phage) surface with specific binding properties by Smith et al. in 1985 [40]. Antibody phage display was developed by McCafferty and colleagues five years later [41].",

Here, we shall briefly describe the construction of a phagemid-based antibody (scFv and Fab) phage display library from immunized or na\u00efve sources. The basic methodology to build APD library from the V-gene repertoire (Figure 2) is almost the same, starting with the extraction of mRNA from B-cells isolated from blood, spleen, tonsils, and tumor tissue samples. Using oligo (dt) primers or random primers, cDNA is synthesized from mRNA through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Defined PCR primer sets, designed on the basis of species consensus sequence and anneal to the conserved region of V-gene families or constant domain, are used to amplify the heavy chain and light chain corresponding region (V H and V L ; V H , C H , V L and C L , respectively) genes within a given immunoglobulin repertoire from cDNA pools, thus revealing the all antibody specificities in a particular individual [4]. The PCR-amplified V H and V L and V H -C H and V L -C L gene fragments are ligated in a suitable phagemid for single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and Fab library generation, respectively. In the case of synthetic antibody phage libraries, the initial few steps are not needed, and library diversity is increased through the precise introduction of degenerate DNA into CDR encoding regions, thus rivaling or exceeding than that of natural immune repertoire [5]. \n\nAntibodies 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13 fragment (scFv) and Fab library generation, respectively.

            "text": "By the mid 1990s the advent of combinatorial chemistry required pharmaceutical companies to adopt assay miniaturisation, the use of robotics and simple \"mix and measure\" technologies to facilitate cost effective ultra high throughput screening of every individual small molecule contained within libraries in excess of 1 \u00d7 10 6 compounds. \n\nIn contrast, combinatorial human antibody libraries (scFv or Fab) made via phage display in E. coli, are significantly larger, containing as many as 1 \u00d7 10 11 individual compounds [1]. As such, they are too large and diverse to be screened as individual members. Instead, the tremendous power of phage display selection [2] is used to identify a sub-population of antibodies from the 10 11 library which are enriched for binding to the target of interest (Figure 1). These sub-populations are typically 10 4 -10 6  and within the same size range as a small molecule library making them much more amenable to high throughput screening. Two or three iterative cycles lead to an enrichment of binding variants with the desired specificity for the target antigen resulting in selected populations numbering 10,000-100,000. Typically, around 20%-70% of the antibodies in these selected populations recognize and bind their target antigen. \n\nHistorically, the outputs from antibody selections were assessed by simple ELISA [3] based methods in order to identify the strongest binders. These binding \"hits\" identified by ELISA were then profiled for the desired pharmacological characteristics, such as antagonism or agonism, firstly as purified antibody fragments and finally as intact IgG's using cell based functional assays. The techniques available for these ELISAs were manual and in 96-well format only. This severely limited the throughput of the discovery process and would often result in failure to identify those antibodies that may be less common in the selected population but have the desired properties. In addition, detection methods such as HRP and alkaline phosphatase were employed which have limitations in terms of their dynamic range and where the upper limits of detection are dictated by instrument sensitivity. \n\nThe disadvantages of this process were obvious. Only a small number of the possible antibodies from the selection outputs could be sampled and a high binding signal by ELISA did not always indicate a potent functional antibody with the desired properties.",

A key advantage of this system is that monoclonal display can be achieved, which facilitates selection of high affinity clones by avoiding the avidity effect during panning. 63,66 Meanwhile, phage infectivity is maximally retained due to the presence of wild type pIII. One drawback of the system is that wild type pIII is more efficiently assembled in the phage particle, resulting in only a small percentage (<10%) of antibody-displaying phage particles in the population. 74 As . According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library. In a typical phagemid system, variable regions of light and heavy chains, either cloned from a natural immunoglobulin repertoire or designed and synthesized in vitro, are cloned into a phage display vector (phagemid), with one of the chains genetically fused to pIII of phage for display. The library pool is then transformed to E.Coli host cells. By infection with helper phage, which provides all the components for phage production, a phage library is generated. Taking solid-phase panning as an example, the phage library is incubated with immobilized antigen. After washing, nonspecific phages are removed and antigen-specific phages stay with the antigen. The bound phages are then dissociated from the antigen by diverse methods, e.g., low-Ph elution, enzymatic cleavage. Lastly, eluted phages are subjected to propagation in E.Coli host cells. After iterative rounds of panning, antigen-specific clones are enriched. Typically, output phages from middle and late rounds of panning are subjected to sequencing and binding characterization for obtaining both sequence diversity and high affinity, respectively.

            "text": "70mg/ml in only 6 d has enabled the SiPF platform to be used in a wide variety of functional assays. In addition, the conditioned media can be diluted while retaining a high antibody concentration to remove any inhibitory components for sensitive screens. The robustness of the SiPF platform has been demonstrated through multiple quality control experiments and sample parallel campaigns.\n\nInterestingly, our examples of the utility of the SiPF platform have yielded antibodies that meet or exceed the potency of those obtained through the screening of larger numbers of scFv or scFv.Fc. Overall, the SiPF platform does not merely serve to maintain the VH-VL pairings during the conversion, but also provides other benefits such as: the separate amplification of k and \u03bb clones ensures that the severely underrepresented Vk clones would get an increased likelihood of being triaged; the stringent PCR quality control in each of the amplification step determine that only full-length antibody sequences are represented in the final IgG pools; and the mammalian cellexpressed IgG in the protein-free medium enables more relevant cell-based functional screening. However, given the small number of campaigns performed so far this represents only a promising first step in a new direction, and more data comparing SiPF with other screening strategies should be accumulated in the future.\n\nIt should be noted that our current SiPF strategy is generally applicable to essentially all existing scFv-or Fab-based phage display antibody libraries through appropriate design of suitable primers. An alternative IgG screening platform after Fabbased phage library selection was reported previously, but this depends on a specially designed phagemid vector for constructing new libraries. 34 Furthermore, the same principle adopted by the SiPF platform can be used in any setting where pairwise cloning of large number of samples in a library is desired.\n\nFinally, the flexibility in the SiPF's design easily allows the introduction of various mutations to the Fc of the IgG vector, thus accommodating special high throughput screening, such as is needed for antibody-drug conjugate discovery programs. We predict that the SiPF platform will provide an enabling shift in the field of phage display and functional screening for antibody discovery.  (1XPBS, 0.01% (v/v) Tween",

            "text": "In this study, we successfully used a protein depletion step as a deep mining strategy to reduce the fraction of antibodies binding previously discovered targets. Importantly, antibodies against targets that are known to be of low therapeutic interest can be removed by this method (Williams et al., 2016), thereby focusing the output onto other receptors displayed by the cell population used for selection. One should however be careful with which proteins to include in a depletion step of a phenotypic discovery as one advantage of this procedure is to find new mechanisms of action for previously known targets (Fransson et al., 2006;Veitonmaki et al., 2013;Roghanian et al., 2015;Ljungars et al., 2018). Overall, protein depletion can be used to reduce the frequency of antibodies of certain specificity without prior generation of antibodies, as a complement to antibody blocking. \n\nNGS has previously been used for discovery of antibodies from phage display libraries (Ravn et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2011;Ravn et al., 2013;Lopez et al., 2017;Yang et al., 2017;Stutz et al., 2018;Barreto et al., 2019). These studies have shown that compared with traditional screening, NGS enables discovery of more clones (Ravn et al., 2010;Ravn et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2017;Stutz et al., 2018), clones with higher affinity (Barreto et al., 2019), or clones binding functionally more interesting epitopes (Lopez et al., 2017;Stutz et al., 2018;Barreto et al., 2019). In many of these studies, the most enriched antibody sequences, against one or several proteins, although sometimes in a complex context (Zhang et al., 2011), have been recovered and used for downstream analysis. In this study, we expanded the use of NGS for phage display antibody discovery and analyzed complex phage pools generated through cell pannings to evaluate not primarily the most abundant clones that had largely already been discovered by direct screening but instead the low-abundant clones that had been enriched through deep mining strategies.",

            "text": "In this study, we expanded the use of NGS for phage display antibody discovery and analyzed complex phage pools generated through cell pannings to evaluate not primarily the most abundant clones that had largely already been discovered by direct screening but instead the low-abundant clones that had been enriched through deep mining strategies. The majority of these antibodies bound to the target cells with no binding to the non-target cells demonstrating selectivity also of low-abundant clones. NGS is thus very powerful as a deep mining strategy and allowed us to identify clones of very low frequencies. A limitation of pure NGS-based screening is currently the cost of gene synthesis and lack of direct evidence of binding specificity of identified clones. However, a reduced cost of gene synthesis in combination with the capability to synthesize thousands of genes (Kuhn et al., 2017) will likely make this approach even more useful for phage display antibody discovery in the future. \n\nOne challenge in the discovery of antibodies against low expressed cell surface receptors is the sensitivity of the assay used for detection of antibody binding. Antibodies to really low expressed receptors, such as the ones discovered through fishing in this study, would have been missed using a flow cytometry screening on primary cells alone, since the signal is close to background. The number of clones binding to targets with a low expression level on the cells increases in the deep mining strategies (Figure 4C) and is therefore most likely higher than the number of clones selected for sequencing in this study. Using a more sensitive assay (Earnshaw and Osbourn, 1999;Gusev et al., 2001), and/or more allowing criteria in the screening, probably would have resulted in identification of even more clones binding to new, currently unknown, targets. \n\nIn summary, a phage pool generated through a cell panning strategy is usually a selective, complex population of binders, many of which are beyond reach when using a discovery approach based on direct screening alone. We show that the combination of direct screening and deep mining enables discovery of clones of both high and low frequencies, which allows additional targets and epitopes to be found. Our findings have the potential to advance discovery of novel targets, pathways, and antibodies to facilitate development of new treatments for patients with various diseases.",

            "text": "Smith established the heterologous expression of peptides on the surface of filamentous phages [16]. Since then, phage display has become a widely used method for the display of both peptide and protein libraries. Antibody formats that can be displayed on phages are limited by their ability to express efficiently in the periplasm of E. coli. Two types of phage systems can be distinguished: phage vector and phagemid vector based display systems. The phage vector system consists of the entire phage genome with the antibody gene inserted as a fusion to a phage surface protein (in most cases gene III). The phagemid system consists of two components: a phagemid carrying the phage surface protein-antibody fusion and a so called helper phage. \n\nA major advantage of phagemid vectors is their smaller size and ease of cloning, allowing for large library sizes. The main difference between both systems lies in the display level of the antibodies. \n\nWhile every phage produced by a phage vector system carries 3-5 copies of the antibody on its surface (multivalent display), the display on phagemid systems is monovalent with <10% of the phages carrying an antibody on the surface [17]. Sometimes both systems are used sequentially, taking advantage of the avidity effect of multivalent display for the first selection round combined with higher stringency of monovalent display in later selection rounds. To improve antibody display levels in the phagemid system, several groups have generated helper phage carrying different mutations affecting gene III [18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. The hyperphage e.g. carries a gene III deletion which leads to multivalent display in combination with a phagemid [21], allowing an easy switch from multivalent to monovalent display within one system. \n\nSince the initial application of phages for the display of antibody fragments by Winter as well as Burton and Lerner a large variety of different phage antibody libraries has been constructed [25,26]. Similar to cell surface display systems, phage library sizes are limited by the transformation efficiency of the bacterial host.",

            "text": "With extensive repertoires reaching up to 10 11 members, naive libraries have the capacity to generate antibodies targeting a diverse array of antigens. In contrast, immune libraries derive from Bcell antibody repertoires of immunized or immune donors, exhibiting a predisposition to a limited panel of antigens and generally being smaller in size. While adept at addressing specific antigens, immune libraries are less suited for identifying antibody fragments against a broad spectrum of antigens, particularly self-antigens [30]. Synthetic libraries leverage computational design and gene synthesis, affording precise control over the composition of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) [28]. Designed in silico, synthetic antibody libraries enable the creation of highly diverse libraries with predetermined structural features, incorporating non-natural amino acids. For example, MorphoSys's HuCAL PLAT-INUM library is a synthetic antibody library meticulously designed for optimal diversity and human-like antibody properties. Similarly, semi-synthetic libraries amalgamate CDRs from natural sources with in silico-designed elements. Early iterations of semi-synthetic libraries maintained diversity through various framework genes. For example, in 1992, Hoogenboom and Winter introduced semi-synthetic scFv-antibody phage display libraries, integrating 49 germline VH sequences and a single V_lambda 3 light chain sequence. These libraries, with a size of 1 \u00d7 10 7 , employed the PCR-based randomization of five or eight residues in the CDR-H3 to enhance diversity [33]. \n\ngoing pre-clinical development or progressing through clinical trials. This section delves into a comprehensive discussion of the five phage display-derived antibodies that have received approval for cancer treatment, emphasizing the valuable role of antibody phage display technology in shaping the landscape of the biopharmaceutical industry (Table 1). It is noteworthy that nine other approved phage display-derived antibodies have been successfully used for non-cancer treatments. For instance, Abicipar pegol, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody fragment, has been approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.",

            "text": "-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1) [52,53].\n\nAnother application of phage display has been in MAbs development [33,35,36]. Large libraries of natural or synthetic antibodies have been constructed using V gene repertoires of the immune system [33]. In brief, these sequences are displayed on the surface of a phage. Then the interaction affinity and specificity of these MAbs are measured by presenting them to the main pathogenic antigens of interest ( Fig. 1) [35,36]. It is noteworthy that the quality and size of such libraries are crucial in discovery of novel and more potent antibodies. The best approach is to construct large phage libraries using the full repertoire of human antibodies to generate full-length antibodies [54]. Hence, the complementarity determining region (CDR) located on antibodies that determine the binding of antigens demonstrate stronger affinity and ability to act against infectious antigens [55]. Marks and colleagues were the first to introduce a method to generate full-length antibodies using human antibody repertoire [56]. Mazor et al. established E-clonal approach, which enables isolation of full-length IgGs from phage displayed libraries [57]. Phage display antibody libraries can be derived from both immunized (donors who have been exposed to the antigens) and non-immunized donors. The genome of non-immunized libraries can be exploited to generate a wide range of antibodies that will lead to the discovery of novel antibodies for novel antigens. On the other hand, antibodies from immunized libraries have a stronger affinity towards the antigen as they have gone through in vivo affinity maturation process [58]. MedImmune, Raxibacumab and human antibody AT005 are just a few examples of phage display contributed MAbs against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) anthrax and cancer, respectively [59][60][61].\n\nUsing the strategy, different SARS-CoV-2 antigens like N, M and E proteins can be panned and targeted for different MAb libraries. After several affinity steps, the strongest MAbs can be screened against SARS-CoV-2. The rational idea behind this approach has been successfully used in finding MAbs for SARS-CoV (",

            "text": "Phage display is a technology established for generating human monoclonal antibodies. This approach is an in vitro technology that confers the potential for generating antibodies from phage libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size while overcoming limitations of in vivo immunization [5,7] . With full-length purified GPC3 and the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 as antigens, we screened the Tomlinson I and J libraries and obtained specific antibody fragments 42A1 and I4A3, from each respectively. In this study, we successfully optimized affinities by in vitro assaying under different scenarios. Semi-synthetic libraries usually have combinations of natural and synthetic diversity. That is, they are often created to increase natural diversity while maintaining a certain level of functional diversity [20] . Although the semi-synthetic libraries, i.e., Tomlinson I and J libraries are sources of antibodies against a large number of different antigens, those antibodies normally exhibit only moderate affinity due to limited diversity [19][20] . Optimizing the CDR sequence in order to improve affinity has been validated by engineering antibodies against various antigens [22,34,[36][37][38] . Constructing a library of mutant variants in phage format provided a fast and convenient way to identify which potent binders bypass the protein purification process. \n\nThe choice of an affinity maturation strategy is related to both the magnitude of affinity increases and the probability of epitope conservation. Therefore, we first optimized antibody affinity by introducing a single site mutation in CDR. We felt this approach might have less chance of influencing epitope. Our results showed that T57H mutation in CDR-H2 of 42A1 and S98M mutation in CDR-H3 of I4A3 both brought 2-to 3-fold improvement in affinity. This suggests that the strategy implemented is feasible; however, we were unable to obtain the optimized variants from the original phage library. This might be due to the limited diversity in the Tomlinson I and J libraries. Additionally, the initial phage library may or may not contain antibody variants with point mutations for those selected.",

To resolve this issue, we created two small combinatorial human Fab antibody libraries using the DVS-II, and isolation of target-specific antibodies was attempted. Biopanning of one antibody library, termed DVFAB-1L library, which has a 1.3 \u00d7 107 combinatorial antibody complexity, against fluorescein-BSA resulted in successful isolation of human Fab clones specific for the antigen despite the presence of only a single light chain in the library. By using the unique feature of the DVS-II, an antibody library of a larger size, named DVFAB-131L, which has a 1.5 \u00d7 109 combinatorial antibody complexity, was also generated in a rapid manner by combining 1.3 \u00d7 107 heavy chains and 131 light chains and more diverse anti-fluorescein-BSA Fab antibody clones were successfully obtained. Our results demonstrate that the DVS-II can be applied readily in creating phage-displayed antibody libraries with much less effort, and target-specific antibody clones can be isolated reliably via light chain promiscuity of antibody molecule",

            "text": "Since many important therapeutic antibodies are antibodies to self-antigens, which is forbidden by tolerance, in vitro generation allows the by-passing of tolerance and the generation of antibodies to self-antigens such as cell surface proteins, or self-products such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). antigen-specific antibodies by creating combinatorial antibody libraries in filamentous phages [4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. In general, combinatorial antibody libraries are constructed from mRNA or RNA extracted from B cells of immunized or na\u00efve donors. Because the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) representing the immunoglobulin geneencoding repertoire are known, we can use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then specific primers to amplify different VH and VL gene families. These variable regions of antibody repertoires are then ligated to the phage display vector (phagemid), with the net result that the antibody is expressed on the surface of the phage and the gene encoding of the antibody is in the phage genome. The antibody-encoding gene is inserted into a phage coat protein gene causing the antibody fragment to be displayed on the outside of the phage, which results in a connection between genotype and phenotype. Once produced, the antibody library in the phage can be bound to an immobilized antigen. This allows us to use multiple binding and elution cycles for selection of antibodies with high affinity and specificity. Phage binders are screened by ELISA, then DNA sequences are analyzed and cloned into appropriate expression vectors to produce antibodies, or various antibody formats, for functional analysis (Figure 1). The antibody format in the phage display library can be a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or Fab fragments. Due to the small size and high solubility of phage particles (10 13 particles/mL), a library size of up to 10 11 independent clones can be effectively generated, and an extensive antibody diversity can be displayed in a single library. One advantage of combinatorial antibody library technology is the diversity of binders. Another advantage is the ability to directly generate human antibodies in vitro.",

            "title": "Selection of Linkers for a Catalytic Single-chain Antibody Using Phage Display Technology*",
            "text": "Phage display has emerged in recent years as a powerful tool for protein engineering (19). Nowhere is this more evident than in the successful isolation of immunoglobulin-based receptors from large combinatorial libraries displayed on filamentous phage and in the modification of the affinity and selectivity of these molecules through multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection (5,6,20). As shown in the current study, phage display can also greatly facilitate the identification of tailored linkers for single-chain antibodies. Even the largest scFv phage libraries can contain but a tiny fraction of the 2.6 \u03eb 10 23 possible 18-amino-acid linkers. Nevertheless, our experiments show that rather small libraries (\u03f75 \u03eb 10 6 clones) are sufficient for the identification of single-chain proteins that are functional with respect to both hapten recognition and catalysis. These results are consistent with those of Stemmer and co-workers (3) who found that approximately 0.2% of the members of an scFv library derived from a metal chelate binding antibody and containing a 15-amino-acid randomized linker segment were active. There are apparently many viable solutions to the problem of linking individual V H and V L domains. \n\nThe principal advantage of the phage display approach is the rapid identification and amplification of functional gene variants that phenotypic selection makes possible. In our experiments this is illustrated by the increased hapten binding activity associated with the scFv pool obtained after five rounds of selection as compared with the starting library. Nevertheless, the diversity of the final pool is still large. The failure of a single clone to dominate the population of selected scFvs may reflect an incomplete course of selection, but a more likely explanation, as mentioned above, is that successful linkers have relatively few sequence requirements. The selection protocol used in these experiments is probably insufficiently stringent to differentiate between receptors with roughly comparable hapten affinities. \n\nAlthough diverse linker sequences yield scFvs that can be selected on the basis of hapten affinity, the resulting molecules are not equally suited for large scale applications.",

            "text": "Several synthetic antibody phage display libraries have been created and used for the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies. The performance of antibody libraries, which is usually measured in terms of their ability to yield high-affinity binding specificities against target proteins of interest, depends both on technical aspects (such as library size and quality of cloning) and on design features (which influence the percentage of functional clones in the library and their ability to be used for practical applications). Here, we describe the design, construction and characterization of a combinatorial phage display library, comprising over 40 billion human antibody clones in single-chain fragment variable (scFv) format. The library was designed with the aim to obtain highly stable antibody clones, which can be affinity-purified on protein A supports, even when used in scFv format. The library was found to be highly functional, as >90% of randomly selected clones expressed the corresponding antibody. When selected against more than 15 antigens from various sources, the library always yielded specific and potent binders, at a higher frequency compared to previous antibody libraries. To demonstrate library performance in practical biomedical research projects, we isolated the human antibody G5, which reacts both against human and murine forms of the alternatively spliced BCD segment of tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix component frequently over-expressed in cancer and in chronic inflammation. The new library represents a useful source of binding specificities, both for academic research and for the development of antibody-based therapeutics.",

Diverse human immunoglobulin-heavy-chain V (VH) gene segments and light-chain V (VL) gene segments were prepared from peripheralblood lymphocytes of non-immunized donors by PCR, and scFvs genes were made by randomly combining VH and VL gene segments using PCR. The combinatorial library (up to ~10 11 genes) can be cloned for display on the surface of phage and used to identify scFvs that bind target antigens. Further progress in phage-display technology has included display of Fabs and high-throughput screening methods adapted from small-molecule drug discovery. A particular strength of phage-display libraries, in contrast to hybridomas technology, is the direct selection for specific binding properties, such as species crossreactivities. In addition, phage-display technology has a capability to provide very large collections of antibodies, which allows the identification of high potency antibodies or with rare combinations of properties.",

            "text": "There are a number of display technologies (phage, ribosome, mRNA, bacterial, etc.) to select peptides for defined proteins targets. In this review, the discussion of display technologies will be restricted to phage display, the most widely utilized display method. \n\nPhage display technique is based on displaying peptides on the surface of a bacteriophage by expressing the peptides as fusions to capsid proteins [45]. Using either lytic or filamentous phage or phagemid vectors, various phage-displayed libraries have been designed but the most common systems are based on filamentous phages in which peptides are fused to coat proteins. The choice of the coat protein is an important factor in modulating the display valency of the fusion protein on the phage particle which can vary between less than one and several thousand copies per virion on average [44]. The fact that a large number of virions occupy a small volume makes it possible to express billions of peptides on phage particles for constructing libraries of the required diversity. In such libraries, each phage displays a unique random peptide. In cases where the peptides are critically big to disrupt the integrity of the capsid at high copies, they can be constrained by cyclization through incorporating pairs of cysteine residues forming intramolecular disulfide bonds [44,45]. Affinity purification is often used to screen phage displaying peptides of interest. Several rounds of screening might be necessary in order to isolate target specific binders. Finally, the tight binding peptides are identified by rapid sequence analysis [37,45]. Unlike rational design, screening phage displayed libraries for bioactive ligands requires no prior knowledge of the target structure [44]. \n\nMirror image phage display is an elegant approach to obtain peptide ligands in the Dconformation which are resistant to gut and serum proteases. In principle, the selection is carried out against a target protein synthesized in the D-amino acid configuration (the mirror image of the original target) using a phage library of peptides in the naturally occurring L-conformation. For reasons of symmetry, the mirror images of these phagedisplayed peptides interact with the target protein of the natural handedness [46].",

            "text": "In the case of synthetic antibody phage libraries, the initial few steps are not needed, and library diversity is increased through the precise introduction of degenerate DNA into CDR encoding regions, thus rivaling or exceeding than that of natural immune repertoire [5]. The engineered phagemids are transformed into suitable bacteria (e.g., XL1-Blue, TG1, and ER2537), providing a suitable environment for recombination of antibody fragments [6]. For rescuing the recombinant phagemid harboring the gene of inserts like Fab or scFv, the transformed bacteria are infected with helper phages like VCSM13 or M13KO7. These phages belong to the M13 class of bacteriophages and are well-adapted for the exposition of antibody-variable scaffolds (Figure 3). This results in a library of phages, where each phage is expressing a unique antibody fragment on its surface as a phenotype while possessing the vector with specific nucleotide sequences within as respective genotypes [7,8]. Now, this antibody phage library is ready to pan against the antigen of choice. By using this methodology, antibody phage libraries of different antibody formats have been successfully constructed, such as Fab (antigen-binding fragment), Fv (variable fragment), scFv (single-chain variable fragment), and its modifications [9,10] diabodies, and other oligomers [11,12]. The science of selection of high-affinity clones is as important as the generation of large, diverse, and more rational antibody libraries. Antigen-specific clones, phages displaying antibody fragments, are screened and enriched from antibody libraries through an iterative process based on interaction affinity, avidity, and binding kinetics between the expressed antibody fragment and the antigen of interest called biopanning. It includes recursive cycles of pooling of antibody displaying phages, incubation with antigen, removal of unbound phages (washing), elution of bound phages, re-amplification in F + E. coli, and re-selection (Figure 4) [13].",

            "text": "By carrying out 2 rounds of phage display, we capture the antibodies showing some reactivity for the target. This reduces the diversity to 10 5 -10 6 , which is compatible with yeast display cloning, and allows further precise sorting to restrict reactivity to those clones recognizing the target of interest. The diversity of the polyclonals after selection was assessed by deep sequencing, with analysis restricted to the HCDR3 because of read length limitations. The number of different HCDR3s selected against the test antigens ranges from 74 to 460 (Table 3), with the actual number of different antibodies likely to be significantly higher when different V L chains and additional V H mutations are taken into account. \n\nIn the single antigen (ubiquitin) in which we assessed the binding abilities of individual monoclonals, all antibodies tested recognized ubiquitin, even down to the least abundant tested antibody, which was present at only 0.04%. This suggests that the vast majority are specific for the target. This depth of diversity allows the removal of cross-reactive clones without significantly affecting the number of different clones: even when antibodies cross-reactive with CTBP1 (or CTBP2) are eliminated, over 90 HCDR3 clusters remain. This great diversity may reflect the relatively high target concentrations we used for selection and sorting, which are expected to eliminate binding discrimination between, and so equalize binding of, low and high affinity antibodies. This may also explain the unexpected finding that there was no correlation between antibody affinity and abundance rank (Fig. 2C). Although we used high target concentrations to increase antibody variety, the unexpectedly high diversity obtained indicates that we could probably improve mean antibody affinity without compromising functional polyclonality, by reducing target concentrations during selection. In preliminary experiments (data not shown), we find a much closer correlation between antibody affinity and rank abundance when target concentrations are significantly reduced. Within the context of future genome scale projects, this will facilitate the ready isolation of high quality sequence defined monoclonals from these polyclonal pools without the need for extensive screening. \n\nConceptually, our approach is superficially similar to recombinant polyclonal antibodies, 33 created by the cloning of Fabs from selected immune phage libraries into mammalian expression vectors. 34",

            "title": "Depth of Sequencing Plays a Determining Role in the Characterization of Phage Display Peptide Libraries by NGS",
            "text": "Peptide phage display relies on the identification of genuine target binders in the recovered phages obtained from biopanning. Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library. Rodi et al. introduced two concepts to define the library diversity: Technical diversity (completeness) which corresponds to the percentage of possible members of the library existing at any absolute frequency and functional diversity which takes into consideration the absolute frequency of each distinct peptide in the library [24]. Consistent with this, Makowski and Soares proposed an analytical expression of the library diversity in which diversity is not only dependent on the number of peptides but also on the relative abundance of each peptide within the library [32]. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as a measure of library diversity. This definition is commonly used to refer to the observed diversity of phage display peptide libraries [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30]. Our data indicated that sequencing depth has a vital impact on the ability to characterize the diversity of the library (Table 1 and Figure 1). A comparison of the two NGS modalities with LTP (720,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) and HTP (5,470,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) showed that the HTP platform can identify a significantly higher number of unique peptide sequences (unique cleaned reads in Table 1), thus revealing a much larger diversity of the library. It is worth mentioning that detecting the full diversity of phage display peptide libraries exceeds the capacity of current NGS platforms. The theoretical diversity of a 12-mer phage display peptide library can reach 4.1 \u00d7 10 15 .",

            "text": "The plasticity of natural immunoglobulin repertoires can be exploited for the generation of phage display libraries. Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, constitute interesting sources of diversity because they are rich in B cells, part of which can be affinity matured. These organs, however, differ in their anatomical structure, reflecting the different fluids they drain, which affects the B cell repertoires. The CDRH3 repertoires from these organs, extracted from na\u00efve or immunized mice, were compared in the context of phage display libraries using human antibody framework families. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that all libraries displayed different CDRH3 repertoires, but the one derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice was the most diverse. Library performance was assessed by in vitro selection. For both organs, immunization increased substantially the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen. The library derived from lymph nodes from na\u00efve mice, however, was the most effective in generating diverse and high affinity candidates. These results illustrate that the use of a biased CDRH3 repertoire increases the performance of libraries, but reduces the clonal diversity, which may be detrimental for certain strategies.",

In this study, we attempted to explore a novel approach for epitope discovery of TiLV, which is a new virus in fish. ABSTRACT Antigen epitope identification is a critical step in the vaccine development process and is a momentous cornerstone for the development of safe and efficient epitope vaccines. In particular, vaccine design is difficult when the function of the protein encoded by the pathogen is unknown. The genome of Tilapia lake virus (TiLV), an emerging virus from fish, encodes protein functions that have not been elucidated, resulting in a lag and uncertainty in vaccine development. Here, we propose a feasible strategy for emerging viral disease epitope vaccine development using TiLV. We determined the targets of specific antibodies in serum from a TiLV survivor by panning a Ph.D.-12 phage library, and we identified a mimotope, TYTTRMHITLPI, referred to as Pep3, which provided protection against TiLV after prime-boost vaccination; its immune protection rate was 57.6%. Based on amino acid sequence alignment and structure analysis of the target protein from TiLV, we further identified a protective antigenic site (399TYTTRNEDFLPT410) which is located on TiLV segment 1 (S1). The epitope vaccine with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH-S1399\u2013410) corresponding to the mimotope induced the tilapia to produce a durable and effective antibody response after immunization, and the antibody depletion test confirmed that the specific antibody against S1399\u2013410 was necessary to neutralize TiLV. Surprisingly, the challenge studies in tilapia demonstrated that the epitope vaccine elicited a robust protective response against TiLV challenge, and the survival rate reached 81.8%. In conclusion, this study revealed a concept for screening antigen epitopes of emerging viral diseases, providing promising approaches for development and evaluation of protective epitope vaccines against viral diseases. IMPORTANCE Antigen epitope determination is an important cornerstone for developing efficient vaccines. In this study, we attempted to explore a novel approach for epitope discovery of TiLV, which is a new virus in fish. We investigated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of all antigenic sites (mimotopes) identified in serum of primary TiLV survivors by using a Ph.D.-12 phage library. We also recognized and identified the natural epitope of TiLV by bioinformatics, evaluated the immunogenicity and protective effect of this antigenic site by immunization, and revealed 2 amino acid residues that play important roles in this epitope. Both Pep3 and S1399\u2013410 (a natural epitope identified by Pep3) elicited antibody titers in tilapia, but S1399\u2013410 was more prominent. Antibody depletion studies showed that anti-S1399\u2013410-specific antibodies were essential for neutralizing TiLV. Our study demonstrated a model for combining experimental and computational screens to identify antigen epitopes, which is attractive for epitope-based vaccine development.",

Numerous phage display antibody libraries have been created over the years with many different specialized features, and the creation of new libraries continues as knowledge and technology expands [10,15,18,20,[24][25][26]]. In this paper we report the construction of a novel domain antibody library with restricted randomizations at 4 and 7 positions in the CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. This was done by the use of trinucleotide synthesized oligonucleotides and an innovative PCR free annealing strategy designed to avoid clonal bias due to sequence and amplification of non-unique clones caused by the PCR cycling.

In the early days, it was postulated that this technique would eventually replace hybridoma technology and animal immunisations. However, since this technology emerged more than 20 years ago, there have only been a handful reports on the construction and application of phage display antibody libraries world-wide.ResultsHere we report the simplest and highly efficient method for the construction of a highly useful human single chain variable fragment (scFv) library. The least number of oligonucleotide primers, electroporations and ligation reactions were used to generate a library of 1.5 \u00d7 108 individual clones, without generation of sub-libraries. All possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension PCR. The key difference from other similar libraries was the highest diversity of variable gene repertoires, which was derived from 140 non-immunized human donors. A wide variety of antigens were successfully used to affinity select specific binders. These included pure recombinant proteins, a hapten and complex antigens such as viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface antigens. In particular, we were able to use standard bio-panning method to isolate antibody that can bind to soluble Aflatoxin B1, when using BSA-conjugated toxin as a target, as demonstrated by inhibition ELISA.ConclusionThese results suggested that by using an optimized protocol and very high repertoire diversity, a compact and efficient phage antibody library can be generated. This advanced method could be adopted by any molecular biology laboratory to generate both na\u00efve or immunized libraries for particular targets as well as for high-throughput applications.",
                    "[21162832 | Christ et al. | 2007 | Citations: 71]": "We recently described a method for the generation of a large human domain antibody repertoire involving combinatorial assembly of CDR building blocks from a smaller repertoire comprising a high frequency of aggregation-resistant antibody domains. Here we show that the frequency of aggregation-resistant domains in the combinatorial repertoire remained high. Furthermore, one of the antigen-binding domains selected from the combinatorial repertoire retained its binding properties through 25 cycles of thermal denaturation, suggesting that antibody domains can be created that rival the heat-resistance of thermophilic proteins such as Taq polymerase.",
                    "[8003471 | Brockmann et al. | 2011 | Citations: 44]": "Affinity maturation is often applied to improve the properties of antibodies isolated from universal antibody libraries in vitro. A synthetic human scFv antibody library was constructed in single immunoglobulin framework to enable rapid affinity maturation by updated Kunkel's mutagenesis. The initial diversity was generated predominantly in the V(H) domain combined with only 36 V(L) domain variants yielding 3 \u00d7 10(10) unique members in the phage-displayed library. After three rounds of panning the enriched V(H) genes from the primary library selections against lysozyme were incorporated into a ready-made circular single-stranded affinity maturation library containing 7 \u00d7 10(8) V(L) gene variants. Several unique antibodies with 0.8-10 nM (K(d), dissociation constant) affinities against lysozyme were found after panning from the affinity maturation library, contrasted by only one anti-lysozyme scFv clone with K(d) <20 nM among the clones panned from the primary universal library. The presented single-framework strategy provides a way to convey significant amount of functional V(H) domain diversity to affinity maturation without bimolecular ligation leading to a diverse set of antibodies with binding affinities in the low nanomolar range."

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

Phage display technology, using single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) offers a powerful alternative obtaining target-specific, genetically stable reagents. Most of scFv obtained to date have been enriched by panning phage libraries to solid-phase coupled antigens. In the present study, HLA-C-specific scFv were isolated using a synthetic phage library in combination with a Cw*0602 overexpressing cell line. ScFv from this procedure precipitated HLA-Cw*0602 heavy chains from whole cell lysates. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that scFv stained HLA-Cw*0602-positive cells, but not cells expressing HLA alleles Cw*0302, Cw*0802, A*0201, B*2705, or Gm1*01011, indicating the specificity of scFv. Similarly they showed an ability to discriminate Cw*0602-positive from Cw*0602-negative peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The results of our study demonstrate the feasibility to genetically engineer single-chain HLA-class I-specific antibodies, by phage display technology. This approach might be a valuable tool to develop a broad range of novel monospecific antibodies against HLA-class I specificities."

The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage (S\u00e4ll et al., 2016). Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions (Nishi et al., 2014). Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases (Loh et al., 2015)(Levy et al., 2013) as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences (Koerber et al., 2015) can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments (Lee et al., 2004)(Entzminger et al., 2015)(Weber et al., 2014)(Henry et al., 2017). The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy.

The performance of antibody libraries, which is usually measured in terms of their ability to yield high-affinity binding specificities against target proteins of interest, depends both on technical aspects (such as library size and quality of cloning) and on design features (which influence the percentage of functional clones in the library and their ability to be used for practical applications). Here, we describe the design, construction and characterization of a combinatorial phage display library, comprising over 40 billion human antibody clones in single-chain fragment variable (scFv) format. The library was designed with the aim to obtain highly stable antibody clones, which can be affinity-purified on protein A supports, even when used in scFv format. The library was found to be highly functional, as >90% of randomly selected clones expressed the corresponding antibody. When selected against more than 15 antigens from various sources, the library always yielded specific and potent binders, at a higher frequency compared to previous antibody libraries. To demonstrate library performance in practical biomedical research projects, we isolated the human antibody G5, which reacts both against human and murine forms of the alternatively spliced BCD segment of tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix component frequently over-expressed in cancer and in chronic inflammation. The new library represents a useful source of binding specificities, both for academic research and for the development of antibody-based therapeutics.",

Most commonly, human sdAbs have been isolated from in vitro display libraries constructed via synthetic randomization of rearranged VH/VL domains. Here, we describe the design and characterization of three novel human VH/VL sdAb libraries through a process of: (i) exhaustive biophysical characterization of 20 potential VH/VL sdAb library scaffolds, including assessment of expression yield, aggregation resistance, thermostability and tolerance to complementarity-determining region (CDR) substitutions; (ii) in vitro randomization of the CDRs of three VH/VL sdAb scaffolds, with tailored amino acid representation designed to promote solubility and expressibility; and (iii) systematic benchmarking of the three VH/VL libraries by panning against five model antigens. We isolated \u22651 antigen-specific human sdAb against four of five targets (13 VHs and 7 VLs in total); these were predominantly monomeric, had antigen-binding affinities ranging from 5\u2009nM to 12\u2009\u00b5M (average: 2\u20133\u2009\u00b5M), but had highly variable expression yields (range: 0.1\u201319\u2009mg/L). Despite our efforts to identify the most stable VH/VL scaffolds, selection of antigen-specific binders from these libraries was unpredictable (overall success rate for all library-target screens: ~53%) with a high attrition rate of sdAbs exhibiting false positive binding by ELISA. By analyzing VH/VL sdAb library sequence composition following selection for monomeric antibody expression (binding to protein A/L followed by amplification in bacterial cells), we found that some VH/VL sdAbs had marked growth advantages over others, and that the amino acid composition of the CDRs of this set of sdAbs was dramatically restricted (bias toward Asp and His and away from aromatic and hydrophobic residues). Thus, CDR sequence clearly dramatically impacts the stability of human autonomous VH/VL immunoglobulin domain folds, and sequence-stability tradeoffs must be taken into account during the design of such libraries.",

By the use of phage display technology, in total 466 unique scFv antibodies specific for 114 different antigens were generated. The specificities of these antibodies were analyzed in a variety of immunochemical assays and a subset was further evaluated for functionality in protein microarray applications. This high-throughput approach demonstrates the ability to rapidly generate a wealth of reagents not only for proteome research, but potentially also for diagnostics and therapeutics. In addition, this work provides a great example on how a synthetic approach can be used to optimize library designs.

Aggregation-resistant antibodies could offset these risks; accordingly, we have developed a directed evolution strategy to improve Fab stability. A Fab-phage display vector was constructed and the VH domain targeted for mutagenesis by error-prone PCR. To enrich for thermoresistant clones, the resulting phage library was transiently heated, followed by selection for binding to an anti-light chain constant domain antibody. Five unique variants were identified, each possessing one to three amino acid substitutions. Each engineered Fab possessed higher, Escherichia coli expression yield, a 2-3\u00b0C increase in apparent melting temperature and improved aggregation resistance upon heating at high concentration. Select mutations were combined and shown to confer additive improvements to these biophysical characteristics. Finally, the wild-type and most stable triple variant Fab variant were converted into a human IgG1 and expressed in mammalian cells. Both expression level and aggregation resistance were similarly improved in the engineered IgG1. Analysis of the wild-type Fab crystal structure provided a structural rationale for the selected residues changes. This approach can help guide future Fab stabilization efforts."

The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage (S\u00e4ll et al., 2016). Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions (Nishi et al., 2014). Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases (Loh et al., 2015)(Levy et al., 2013) as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences (Koerber et al., 2015) can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments (Lee et al., 2004)(Entzminger et al., 2015)(Weber et al., 2014)(Henry et al., 2017). The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy. They should also produce more useful reagents."

These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies.",

Therefore, strategies to predict at the early phases of antibody development the risk of late-stage failure of antibody candidates are highly valuable. In this work, we employ the in silico solubility predictor CamSol to design a library of 17 variants of a humanized mAb predicted to span a broad range of solubility values, and we examine their developability potential with a battery of commonly used in vitro and in silico assays. Our results demonstrate the ability of CamSol to rationally enhance mAb developability, and provide a quantitative comparison of in vitro developability measurements with each other and with more resource-intensive solubility measurements, as well as with in silico predictors that offer a potentially faster and cheaper alternative. We observed a strong correlation between predicted and experimentally determined solubility values, as well as with measurements obtained using a panel of in vitro developability assays that probe non-specific interactions. These results indicate that computational methods have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need of carrying out laborious in vitro quality controls for large numbers of lead candidates. Overall, our study provides support to the emerging view that the implementation of in silico tools in antibody discovery campaigns can ensure rapid and early selection of antibodies with optimal developability potential.",

Early identification of these negative characteristics is essential. Akin to the Lipinski guidelines, which measure druglikeness in small molecules, our Therapeutic Antibody Profiler highlights antibodies that possess characteristics that are rare/unseen in clinical-stage mAb therapeutics. The only required input is the variable domain sequence. We show examples where our approach would have advised against manufacturing antibodies that were found to aggregate or have poor expression. Therapeutic mAbs must not only bind to their target but must also be free from \u201cdevelopability issues\u201d such as poor stability or high levels of aggregation. While small-molecule drug discovery benefits from Lipinski\u2019s rule of five to guide the selection of molecules with appropriate biophysical properties, there is currently no in silico analog for antibody design. Here, we model the variable domain structures of a large set of post-phase-I clinical-stage antibody therapeutics (CSTs) and calculate in silico metrics to estimate their typical properties. In each case, we contextualize the CST distribution against a snapshot of the human antibody gene repertoire. We describe guideline values for five metrics thought to be implicated in poor developability: the total length of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), the extent and magnitude of surface hydrophobicity, positive charge and negative charge in the CDRs, and asymmetry in the net heavy- and light-chain surface charges. The guideline cutoffs for each property were derived from the values seen in CSTs, and a flagging system is proposed to identify nonconforming candidates. On two mAb drug discovery sets, we were able to selectively highlight sequences with developability issues. We make available the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP), a computational tool that builds downloadable homology models of variable domain sequences, tests them against our five developability guidelines, and reports potential sequence liabilities and canonical forms.

Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient (Knappik et al., 2000)75,(Tiller et al., 2013); however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified (Yang et al., 2009)(Rothe et al., 2008)(Bai et al., 2017). Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire (Fellouse et al., 2007)(Fellouse et al., 2005). Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens.",

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

In this study, a fully synthetic human scFv library with six diversified CDRs was constructed by polymerase chain reaction assembly of overlapping oligonucleotides. In order to maximize the functional diversity of the library, a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy was employed in which the assembled scFv gene repertoire was fused to the 5\u2032-end of the \u03b2-lactamase gene, and in-frame scFv clones were enriched by carbenicillin selection.

The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs.

Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens."

In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability.

One potential issue is the risk of false positives or false negatives due to the complexity of the screening process (Sell et al., 2022). This can occur if the phage library is not sufficiently diverse or if the screening conditions are not optimized for the specific antibody or epitope of interest. Additionally, the size of the phage library and the number of potential epitopes to screen can be a limitation, as large libraries may require extensive sequencing and analysis, and the screening process may miss rare or low-affinity epitopes.",

The commercial Ph.D.TM-7 phage display library is used extensively for peptide discovery. This library is based on the M13KE vector, which carries the lacZ\u03b1 sequence, leading to the formation of blue plaques on IPTG-X-gal agar plates. In the current study, we report the isolation of a fast-propagating white clone (displaying WSLGYTG peptide) identified through screening against a recombinant protein. Sanger sequencing demonstrated that white plaques are not contamination from environmental M13-like phages, but derive from the library itself. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the white color of the plaques results from a large 827-nucleotide genomic deletion. The phenotypic characterization of propagation capacity through plaque count- and NGS-based competitive propagation assay supported the higher propagation rate of Ph-WSLGYTG clone compared with the library. According to our data, white plaques are likely to arise endogenously in Ph.D. libraries due to mutations in the M13KE genome and should not always be viewed as exogenous contamination. Our findings also led to the conclusion that the deletion observed here might be an ancestral mutation already present in the na\u00efve library, which causes target-unrelated nonspecific enrichment of white clone during biopanning due to propagation advantage.",

One potential issue is the risk of false positives or false negatives due to the complexity of the screening process (Sell et al., 2022). This can occur if the phage library is not sufficiently diverse or if the screening conditions are not optimized for the specific antibody or epitope of interest. Additionally, the size of the phage library and the number of potential epitopes to screen can be a limitation, as large libraries may require extensive sequencing and analysis, and the screening process may miss rare or low-affinity epitopes."

This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 (Jones et al., 2016). This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) (Parmley et al., 1988)...Constructing a phage display library involves several key steps aimed at generating a diverse repertoire of displayed peptides or proteins for subsequent screening against target molecules. Initially, a source of genetic material encoding the desired peptides or proteins is obtained, which can include synthetic DNA sequences, cDNA libraries, or genomic DNA. Next, this genetic material is ligated into a phagemid vector, which contains the genetic elements necessary for phage display, including a phage coat protein gene fused to the peptide or protein of interest. The ligated DNA is then introduced into competent Escherichia coli cells via transformation, where it undergoes replication and amplification. Following transformation, the bacterial cells are infected with helper phage, which provides the necessary components for packaging the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The infected cells are then cultured to allow for phage production, and the resulting phage display library is harvested by collecting the culture supernatant or lysing the bacterial cells to release the phage particles. The library can be further characterized by sequencing a subset of clones to assess diversity and by performing binding assays to confirm the display of the desired peptides or proteins (Figure 2) [12].",

While this is relatively simple for soluble proteins which can be purified and immobilized onto a plastic surface, membrane proteins offer significant challenges for antibody discovery. Whole cell panning allows presentation of the membrane protein in its native conformation, but is complicated by a low target antigen density, high background of irrelevant antigens and non-specific binding of phage particles to cell surfaces. The method described here uses transient transfection of alternating host cell lines and stringent washing steps to address each of these limitations. The successful isolation of antibodies from a naive scFv library is described for three membrane bound proteins; human CD83, canine CD117 and bat CD11b."

Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32](Azzazy et al., 2002)(McCafferty et al., 1990). It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery (Kumar et al., 2019). The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology...For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes (Wang et al., 2016)(Erasmus et al., 2021). Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies.",

Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes (Wang et al., 2016)(Erasmus et al., 2021). Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies."

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

In this study, to overcome these difficulties, we devised a \u2018pattern enrichment analysis.\u2019 In this method, two samples (one obtained by affinity selection, the other simply amplified without selection) are prepared, and the two sequence datasets read on next-generation sequencer are compared to find the three-residue pattern most enriched in the selected sample. This allows us to compare two sequence datasets with high coverage and facilitates the identification of peptide sequences and the key residues for binding. We also demonstrated that this approach in the combination with structured peptide libraries allowed spatial mapping of the enriched sequence patterns. Here, we prepared a phage library displaying chemically stapled helical peptides with the X1C2X3X4X5X6X7X8C9X10 sequence, where X is any amino acid. To validate our method, we performed screening against the HDM2 protein. The results showed that the hydrophobic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp and Leu) that are key to interactions with HDM2 were clearly identified by the pattern enrichment analysis.

Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response.

The amino acid sequences of the peptides displayed on the phage are then determined by sequencing the corresponding coding region in the viral DNA's.

This will help readers understand the subsequent sections.\n\n2. Library Size and Diversity: This appears to be one of the most critical factors mentioned across multiple quotes. It relates to the number of unique antibody variants in a library and how this impacts the probability of finding high-affinity antibodies.\n\n3. Sources of Diversity: Several quotes discuss different types of libraries (na\u00efve, immunized, synthetic, semisynthetic) and their respective advantages. This dimension will explain where the diversity comes from.\n\n4. CDR Design Strategies: Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are mentioned frequently as key elements for antibody binding. Their design, length, and amino acid composition significantly impact library performance.\n\n5. Framework Selection: Several quotes mention the importance of choosing appropriate antibody frameworks for optimal stability, expression, and developability.\n\n6. Technical Considerations in Library Construction: Many quotes discuss specific technical aspects of library creation, including vector preparation, transformation efficiency, and other practical considerations.\n\n7. Factors Affecting Selection and Screening: Beyond library design, quotes mention factors that influence the success of phage display campaigns, including selection conditions and amplification biases.\n\nFor each dimension, I'll decide on the appropriate format:\n\n1. Introduction/Background: This should be a synthesis to provide coherent context.\n\n2. Library Size and Diversity: Synthesis format would be best to explain the relationship between library size, diversity, and antibody discovery success.\n\n3. Sources of Diversity: A list format would work well to clearly distinguish between different sources.\n\n4. CDR Design Strategies: Synthesis format to explain the complex interplay of CDR design considerations.\n\n5. Framework Selection: A synthesis format to explain the rationale and considerations for framework selection.\n\n6. Technical Considerations in Library Construction: List format to clearly outline the various technical factors.\n\n7. Factors Affecting Selection and Screening: Synthesis format to explain how these factors interact.\n\nThis organization covers all the critical factors mentioned in the quotes while presenting the information in a logical and accessible manner.",

                "tldr": "Phage display is a powerful technology that enables the selection of antibodies with specific binding properties from large libraries displayed on bacteriophage surfaces. This technique leverages the connection between genotype and phenotype, allowing researchers to isolate antibodies with desired characteristics through iterative rounds of selection. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nPhage display is a robust platform for antibody discovery that connects a protein's phenotype (binding properties) with its genotype (encoding DNA). The technology works by genetically fusing antibody fragments to bacteriophage coat proteins, causing the antibody to be \"displayed\" on the phage surface while its genetic information is safely packaged inside the phage particle. This physical linkage between an antibody and its gene enables researchers to isolate specific antibodies based on their binding properties and then recover their genetic information for further study and development. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe most common phage display format uses filamentous phage (such as M13, fd, or f1), where antibody fragments\u2014typically single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) or antigen-binding fragments (Fabs)\u2014are fused to coat proteins like pIII or pVIII. The power of phage display lies in its ability to screen billions of different antibody variants simultaneously through a process called biopanning, where phage-displayed antibodies are exposed to an immobilized target antigen, unbound phage are washed away, and specifically bound phage are eluted and amplified for subsequent rounds of selection. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe success of antibody discovery via phage display hinges critically on two main factors: the quality and diversity of the initial antibody library, and the effectiveness of the selection strategy. Libraries can be constructed from immunized or na\u00efve sources, or through synthetic approaches that introduce designed diversity. After multiple rounds of selection, enriched antibodies can be characterized for binding affinity, specificity, stability, and other desirable properties, making phage display an invaluable tool for therapeutic antibody development. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "tldr": "The size and diversity of a phage display library are critical factors that directly correlate with the probability of isolating high-affinity antibodies. Larger libraries (typically 10^9-10^11 members) with functional diversity across multiple frameworks and CDRs provide the best chance of discovering antibodies with desirable binding and biophysical properties.

                "text": "\nLibrary size and diversity represent the cornerstone parameters that determine the success of antibody discovery using phage display technology. The quality of an antibody library is fundamentally dependent on its complexity or diversity, which directly reflects the probability of finding high-affinity antibodies against any given target <Paper corpusId=\"219399137\" paperTitle=\"(Bashir et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258334472\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Multiple studies have demonstrated a linear correlation between library size and the highest obtainable antibody affinity, indicating that larger libraries significantly enhance the chances of isolating high-quality binders <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nModern phage display libraries typically aim for a diversity of 10^9 to 10^11 independent clones <Paper corpusId=\"14583194\" paperTitle=\"(Kugler et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22982240\" paperTitle=\"(Leow et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Due to technical limitations, particularly during bacterial transformation, achieving libraries larger than 10^11 variants remains challenging even with optimization <Paper corpusId=\"221342908\" paperTitle=\"(Alfaleh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. The phage display format enables high density of particles (10^13 particles/mL), allowing for effective representation of extensive antibody diversity in a single library <Paper corpusId=\"233424160\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile library size is crucial, functional diversity\u2014the proportion of displayed antibodies that are correctly folded and capable of binding\u2014is equally important. Issues such as stop codons, reading frame shifts, and poor expression can reduce functional diversity <Paper corpusId=\"221342908\" paperTitle=\"(Alfaleh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. An effective library should not only be large but also display antibody variants as functional fragments with proper folding and minimal biophysical liabilities <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe source of diversity significantly impacts library quality. Libraries can be categorized as:\n\n1. Natural libraries (na\u00efve or immunized) - derived from B cells of donors\n2. Synthetic libraries - constructed using designed diversity in CDRs\n3. Semi-synthetic libraries - combining natural and synthetic elements\n\n <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe number of donors has traditionally been considered important for maximizing diversity, with some libraries using B cells from numerous individuals <Paper corpusId=\"14583194\" paperTitle=\"(Kugler et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, recent research suggests that the total number of lymphocytes, rather than the number of donors, may be the critical factor, with evidence that a single donor with sufficient lymphocytes can produce a highly functional library <Paper corpusId=\"232296539\" paperTitle=\"(Erasmus et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269574517\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe design of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) is another crucial consideration. Libraries may diversify all six CDRs or focus primarily on the most variable regions (CDR-H3 and CDR-L3) <Paper corpusId=\"246433314\" paperTitle=\"(Davydova, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The amino acid diversity and distribution in CDRs, particularly in CDR-H3, plays a vital role in library functionality <Paper corpusId=\"14583194\" paperTitle=\"(Kugler et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFramework selection also impacts library quality. While some successful libraries use a single framework pair, libraries incorporating multiple frameworks generally provide better structural diversity to accommodate various epitopes <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Frameworks are typically selected based on their frequency in natural repertoires, stability, expression levels, and display efficiency.\n\nThe evolution of library design has shifted from focusing solely on size and affinity to also considering developability factors such as expression, stability, and production characteristics <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This holistic approach aims to generate not just high-affinity binders but antibodies with favorable biophysical properties suitable for therapeutic development <Paper corpusId=\"221342908\" paperTitle=\"(Alfaleh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"54630768\" paperTitle=\"(Perez et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn summary, the construction of a high-quality phage display library with optimal size and diversity remains fundamental to successful antibody discovery <Paper corpusId=\"257725782\" paperTitle=\"(Choi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The continuous evolution of library design approaches reflects the industry's growing understanding of the complex relationship between library characteristics and the ability to isolate antibodies with desired therapeutic properties.",

Theoretically, the probability of finding a functional antibody against a given antigen is higher in large complex or more diverse libraries than in a less complex or diverse library. It is approximated by the transformation efficiency of the bacteria used to amplify the library.

In the subsequent thirty plus years practicing phage display, it has been well established that the size and functionality of a library are critical parameters for success in isolating specific and high affinity antibodies from said library. Early selections from antibody phage-displayed libraries of 10 7 members generated ~90 nM antibody fragments to diverse proteins. (Marks et al., 1991) Further studies using larger libraries, e.g., >10 10 members, (Haard et al., 1999)(Vaughan et al., 1996) produced antibody fragments with single-digit nM or sub-nM affinities. Similarly, a synthetic library called the Griffiths' library 9 of >10 10 members produced sub-nM binders, whereas antibody fragments of >100 nM were obtained when a small portion of the library containing only 10 7 clones was used in the selection process."

The bacterial transformation step during library construction; however, is a main practical bottleneck that limits the size of the library from exceeding 10 11 antibody variants, even after optimization and performing numerous electroporation steps.\n\nIdeally, antibody phage display libraries should not only be large and diverse, but also should display antibody variants as functional fragments. Issues related to the nucleotide sequences, such as the presence of stop codons, or the addition/deletion of nucleotides can occur during the library construction (135)(136)(137).

These variable regions of antibody repertoires are then ligated to the phage display vector (phagemid), with the net result that the antibody is expressed on the surface of the phage and the gene encoding of the antibody is in the phage genome. The antibody-encoding gene is inserted into a phage coat protein gene causing the antibody fragment to be displayed on the outside of the phage, which results in a connection between genotype and phenotype. Once produced, the antibody library in the phage can be bound to an immobilized antigen. This allows us to use multiple binding and elution cycles for selection of antibodies with high affinity and specificity",
                            "Due to the small size and high solubility of phage particles (10 13 particles/mL), a library size of up to 10 11 independent clones can be effectively generated, and an extensive antibody diversity can be displayed in a single library. One advantage of combinatorial antibody library technology is the diversity of binders. Another advantage is the ability to directly generate human antibodies in vitro. Since many important therapeutic antibodies are antibodies to self-antigens, which is forbidden by tolerance, in vitro generation allows the by-passing of tolerance and the generation of antibodies to self-antigens such as cell surface proteins, or self-products such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)."

                            "However, library design is highly variable and plays a central role in phage display-based antibody discovery.\n\nAccording to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies.\n\nRegarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design."

Generally, the greater the antibody library diversity, the greater the probability of selecting a diverse array of high affinity leads. According to this paradigm, the primary means of elevating library diversity has been by increasing the number of donors. In the present study we explored the possibility of creating an in vitro antibody library from a single healthy individual, showing that the number of lymphocytes, rather than the number of donors, is the key criterion in the production of a diverse and functional antibody library. We describe the construction of a high-quality phage display library comprising 5 \u00d7 10 9 human antibodies by applying an efficient B cell extraction protocol from a single donor and a targeted V-gene amplification strategy favoring specific antibody families for their improved developability profiles."

Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32](Azzazy et al., 2002)(McCafferty et al., 1990). It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery (Kumar et al., 2019). The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology",
                            "For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes (Wang et al., 2016)(Erasmus et al., 2021). Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies."

                            "Aiming for the library size \u226410 10 unique CDR combinations can significantly improve the clone coverage and sampling power of the phage display. \n\nAs was stated above, theoretical size of the library depends on its design: the number of CDRs touched, the length range of the CDR loops and quality, and quantity of the codon randomization events in each CDR. Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient (Knappik et al., 2000)75,(Tiller et al., 2013); however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified (Yang et al., 2009)(Rothe et al., 2008)(Bai et al., 2017). Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire (Fellouse et al., 2007)(Fellouse et al., 2005). Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens."

                            "ABSTRACT Despite major advances in antibody discovery technologies, the successful development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) into effective therapeutic and diagnostic agents can often be impeded by developability liabilities, such as poor expression, low solubility, high viscosity and aggregation. Therefore, strategies to predict at the early phases of antibody development the risk of late-stage failure of antibody candidates are highly valuable. In this work, we employ the in silico solubility predictor CamSol to design a library of 17 variants of a humanized mAb predicted to span a broad range of solubility values, and we examine their developability potential with a battery of commonly used in vitro and in silico assays. Our results demonstrate the ability of CamSol to rationally enhance mAb developability, and provide a quantitative comparison of in vitro developability measurements with each other and with more resource-intensive solubility measurements, as well as with in silico predictors that offer a potentially faster and cheaper alternative. We observed a strong correlation between predicted and experimentally determined solubility values, as well as with measurements obtained using a panel of in vitro developability assays that probe non-specific interactions. These results indicate that computational methods have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need of carrying out laborious in vitro quality controls for large numbers of lead candidates. Overall, our study provides support to the emerging view that the implementation of in silico tools in antibody discovery campaigns can ensure rapid and early selection of antibodies with optimal developability potential."

                            "However, library design is highly variable and plays a central role in phage display-based antibody discovery.\n\nAccording to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies.\n\nRegarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design."

Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32](Azzazy et al., 2002)(McCafferty et al., 1990). It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery (Kumar et al., 2019). The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology",

Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes (Wang et al., 2016)(Erasmus et al., 2021). Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies."

Generally, the greater the antibody library diversity, the greater the probability of selecting a diverse array of high affinity leads. According to this paradigm, the primary means of elevating library diversity has been by increasing the number of donors. In the present study we explored the possibility of creating an in vitro antibody library from a single healthy individual, showing that the number of lymphocytes, rather than the number of donors, is the key criterion in the production of a diverse and functional antibody library. We describe the construction of a high-quality phage display library comprising 5 \u00d7 10 9 human antibodies by applying an efficient B cell extraction protocol from a single donor and a targeted V-gene amplification strategy favoring specific antibody families for their improved developability profiles."

These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function.\n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3",
                            "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance",
                            "Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55].\n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

Following the natural antibody tendency favoring the highest variability and paratope involvement in L3 and H3 CDRs, most sAB libraries that have only H3 and L3 diversified and just one of the canonical natural sequences incorporated in place of each of other four CDRs, proved to be very efficient (Knappik et al., 2000)75,(Tiller et al., 2013); however, some high quality libraries have all six CDRs diversified (Yang et al., 2009)(Rothe et al., 2008)(Bai et al., 2017). Surprisingly, the minimalist libraries, con taining sequences of only two residues, Tyr and Ser, in their CDRs, were proven highly effective in generating specific antibodies against a wide array of antigens pro viding a rationale for high abundance of these two residues in the CDRs of the natural immune reper toire (Fellouse et al., 2007)(Fellouse et al., 2005). Due to the simpler design, these libraries are relatively easy to construct, and, due to the smaller theoretical size, they possess higher sampling power. Involvement of more of CDRs and CDR positions into deeper diversification, while producing an exponentially increasing number of possible variants, allows to build more enhanced and sterically extended paratopes with higher conformational diversity, thus, facilitating efficient recognition of various epitopes of different types of anti gens."

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

Antibody clones from synthetic libraries with optimized design features have several distinct advantages that include high stability, high levels of expression, and ease of downstream optimization and engineering. In this study, a fully synthetic human scFv library with six diversified CDRs was constructed by polymerase chain reaction assembly of overlapping oligonucleotides. In order to maximize the functional diversity of the library, a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy was employed in which the assembled scFv gene repertoire was fused to the 5\u2032-end of the \u03b2-lactamase gene, and in-frame scFv clones were enriched by carbenicillin selection. A final library with an estimated total diversity of 7.6 \u00d7 109, greater than 70% functional diversity, and diversification of all six CDRs was obtained after insertion of fully randomized CDR-H3 sequences into this proofread repertoire. The performance of the library was validated using a number of target antigens, against which multiple unique scFv sequences with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range were isolated."

These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function.\n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3",
                            "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance",
                            "Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55].\n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity."

In this paper we report the construction of a novel domain antibody library with restricted randomizations at 4 and 7 positions in the CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. This was done by the use of trinucleotide synthesized oligonucleotides and an innovative PCR free annealing strategy designed to avoid clonal bias due to sequence and amplification of non-unique clones caused by the PCR cycling.

                            "Based on the notion that antibody paratopes are enriched with aromatic residues, noticeable upon solving the first structures of antibody-antigen complexes 11 and surveys of antibody structures and sequences thereafter, [12][13][14] the fundamental role of the tyrosyl side chains in antibodyantigen recognition has been demonstrated [46][47][48][49] with the functional antibodies selected and screened from the minimalist designs of antibody CDR libraries with only a small subset of amino acid types (Tyr, Ala, Asp, Ser) 49 or with binary code (Tyr and Ser). 48 Synthetic antibody libraries based on the observed distributions of amino acid type in antibodies have also been demonstrated to be productive tools in antibody discoveries. 50 The antibody libraries developed in this study are different from the previously developed synthetic antibody libraries in that our antibody libraries have been constructed with antibody-antigen (proteins and peptides) interaction propensity predictions as guidance. We used the computational methodology to assess antibody library designs to ensure that the antibody variants in the synthetic antibody libraries have substantial antibody-antigen interaction propensities, rather than just to imitate antibody sequences in nature or limit to the minimalist designs for antibody library constructions."

Ylanthia comprises 36 fixed immunoglobulin (Ig) variable heavy (VH)/variable light (VL) chain pairs, which cover a broad range of canonical complementarity-determining region (CDR) structures. The variable Ig heavy and Ig light (VH/VL) chain pairs were selected for biophysical characteristics favorable to manufacturing and development. The selection process included multiple parameters, e.g., assessment of protein expression yield, thermal stability and aggregation propensity in fragment antigen binding (Fab) and IgG1 formats, and relative Fab display rate on phage. The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs. Phage selection was performed against various antigens and unique antibodies with excellent biophysical properties were isolated. Our results confirm that quality can be built into an antibody library by prudent selection of unmodified, fully human VH/VL pairs as scaffolds."

A large repertoire of functional antibodies with similar properties was produced by appending short variable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) onto the two antibody germ line segments most frequently found in human antibodies. With this strategy we concentrated sequence diversity in regions of the antibody structure that are centrally located in the antigen binding site, while leaving residues in more peripheral positions available for further mutagenesis aimed at improving the affinity of the selected antibodies."

                            "Phage display technology has been widely used for antibody affinity maturation for decades. The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions."

                            "However, library design is highly variable and plays a central role in phage display-based antibody discovery.\n\nAccording to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies.\n\nRegarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design."

                "text": "\nFramework selection represents a critical aspect of phage display library design that significantly impacts antibody discovery outcomes. Early phage display libraries often utilized single framework pairs, but modern approaches recognize that libraries incorporating multiple frameworks generally provide superior structural diversity to accommodate various epitope topologies <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This evolution reflects a growing understanding that structural diversity from different frameworks complements sequence diversity within CDRs.\n\nThe most advanced synthetic libraries typically incorporate seven VH and seven VL (four V\u03ba and three V\u03bb) germline families that collectively cover more than 95% of natural human antibody diversity <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. These frameworks are carefully selected based on several key parameters, including their frequency in natural repertoires, structural stability, expression efficiency, and display levels on phage surfaces <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFramework selection has evolved significantly from early approaches that focused primarily on maximizing diversity and affinity to more sophisticated strategies that balance these factors with developability considerations <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. Modern libraries prioritize frameworks with favorable biophysical properties that minimize aggregation, improve expression, and enhance manufacturing characteristics <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nImportantly, frameworks known to be associated with developability issues are deliberately excluded from modern library designs. For example, certain IGHV4 family genes have been observed to be deselected during phage panning, and VH4-34 has been associated with B cell cytotoxicity, making these germlines poor candidates for inclusion in therapeutic antibody libraries <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe modular design of frameworks has become increasingly important in library construction. By introducing unique restriction sites flanking CDR regions, modern libraries enable rapid optimization through CDR shuffling or targeted mutagenesis without requiring detailed knowledge of the particular sequence <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. This modular approach greatly facilitates subsequent affinity maturation campaigns.\n\nRecent advanced library designs have taken framework optimization a step further by focusing on residues outside the traditional CDR regions that may still influence binding. For example, some libraries incorporate diversification in positions that bind both protein and peptide targets based on analysis of antibody-antigen complexes of known structure <Paper corpusId=\"273402071\" paperTitle=\"(Almagro et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These approaches use amino acid frequencies found in human antibody sequences while deliberately avoiding residues that may lead to developability liabilities.\n\nSome minimalist library designs have successfully employed a single framework with diversity limited primarily to CDR-H3, demonstrating that framework diversity is not always essential for successful antibody discovery <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, these approaches typically require careful selection of the framework and strategic diversity introduction to compensate for the limited structural variation.\n\nThe evolution of framework selection and optimization reflects the industry's growing understanding that successful antibody discovery requires not just high-affinity binders but molecules with favorable developability characteristics suitable for therapeutic applications <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

                            "In the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression. These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function.\n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3",
                            "It was observed that loop length and CDR-H3 stem composition (potentially stabilizing the loop) played a key role in the functional output, whereas diversification of CDR-L3 was not essential for library performance",
                            "Broadening the diversity by the inclusion of nonparatope residues not only enhances affinity but is necessary for target specificity, as well as CDR-H3 loop length [52] and the CDR-L3 loop length influences VH antigen interactions [55].\n\nThus, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries incorporate design features such as a germline framework known to have favorable developability features. The most important aspect of diversity in any phage antibody library is that of the complementarity determining regions or CDRs, which confer antigen recognition and specificity."

                            "With potential application to all recombinant antibody library types are the recent improvement in library design and display efficiency. The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage (S\u00e4ll et al., 2016). Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions (Nishi et al., 2014). Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases (Loh et al., 2015)(Levy et al., 2013) as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences (Koerber et al., 2015) can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments (Lee et al., 2004)(Entzminger et al., 2015)(Weber et al., 2014)(Henry et al., 2017). The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy. They should also produce more useful reagents."

The bacterial transformation step during library construction; however, is a main practical bottleneck that limits the size of the library from exceeding 10 11 antibody variants, even after optimization and performing numerous electroporation steps.\n\nIdeally, antibody phage display libraries should not only be large and diverse, but also should display antibody variants as functional fragments. Issues related to the nucleotide sequences, such as the presence of stop codons, or the addition/deletion of nucleotides can occur during the library construction (135)(136)(137).

                            "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 (Jones et al., 2016). This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) (Parmley et al., 1988)",
                            "Constructing a phage display library involves several key steps aimed at generating a diverse repertoire of displayed peptides or proteins for subsequent screening against target molecules. Initially, a source of genetic material encoding the desired peptides or proteins is obtained, which can include synthetic DNA sequences, cDNA libraries, or genomic DNA. Next, this genetic material is ligated into a phagemid vector, which contains the genetic elements necessary for phage display, including a phage coat protein gene fused to the peptide or protein of interest. The ligated DNA is then introduced into competent Escherichia coli cells via transformation, where it undergoes replication and amplification. Following transformation, the bacterial cells are infected with helper phage, which provides the necessary components for packaging the phagemid DNA into phage particles. The infected cells are then cultured to allow for phage production, and the resulting phage display library is harvested by collecting the culture supernatant or lysing the bacterial cells to release the phage particles. The library can be further characterized by sequencing a subset of clones to assess diversity and by performing binding assays to confirm the display of the desired peptides or proteins (Figure 2) [12]."

However, its large-scale implementation requires tools and technologies that allow development of suitable antibody or antibody fragments in a high-throughput manner. To address this we designed and constructed two human synthetic antibody fragment (scFv) libraries denoted HelL-11 and HelL-13. By the use of phage display technology, in total 466 unique scFv antibodies specific for 114 different antigens were generated. The specificities of these antibodies were analyzed in a variety of immunochemical assays and a subset was further evaluated for functionality in protein microarray applications. This high-throughput approach demonstrates the ability to rapidly generate a wealth of reagents not only for proteome research, but potentially also for diagnostics and therapeutics. In addition, this work provides a great example on how a synthetic approach can be used to optimize library designs. By having precise control of the diversity introduced into the antigen-binding sites, synthetic libraries offer increased understanding of how different diversity contributes to antibody binding reactivity and stability, thereby providing the key to future library optimization."

Because the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) representing the immunoglobulin geneencoding repertoire are known, we can use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then specific primers to amplify different VH and VL gene families. These variable regions of antibody repertoires are then ligated to the phage display vector (phagemid), with the net result that the antibody is expressed on the surface of the phage and the gene encoding of the antibody is in the phage genome. The antibody-encoding gene is inserted into a phage coat protein gene causing the antibody fragment to be displayed on the outside of the phage, which results in a connection between genotype and phenotype. Once produced, the antibody library in the phage can be bound to an immobilized antigen. This allows us to use multiple binding and elution cycles for selection of antibodies with high affinity and specificity",

One advantage of combinatorial antibody library technology is the diversity of binders. Another advantage is the ability to directly generate human antibodies in vitro. Since many important therapeutic antibodies are antibodies to self-antigens, which is forbidden by tolerance, in vitro generation allows the by-passing of tolerance and the generation of antibodies to self-antigens such as cell surface proteins, or self-products such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)."

Cyclic peptides exhibit enhanced stability and rigidity (Joo, 2012), leading to improved affinities and resistance to degradation, whereas linear peptides offer flexibility and conformational diversity. Optimal peptide length and conformation vary based on the target and experimental conditions.

One potential issue is the risk of false positives or false negatives due to the complexity of the screening process (Sell et al., 2022). This can occur if the phage library is not sufficiently diverse or if the screening conditions are not optimized for the specific antibody or epitope of interest. Additionally, the size of the phage library and the number of potential epitopes to screen can be a limitation, as large libraries may require extensive sequencing and analysis, and the screening process may miss rare or low-affinity epitopes."

The commercial Ph.D.TM-7 phage display library is used extensively for peptide discovery. This library is based on the M13KE vector, which carries the lacZ\u03b1 sequence, leading to the formation of blue plaques on IPTG-X-gal agar plates. In the current study, we report the isolation of a fast-propagating white clone (displaying WSLGYTG peptide) identified through screening against a recombinant protein. Sanger sequencing demonstrated that white plaques are not contamination from environmental M13-like phages, but derive from the library itself. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the white color of the plaques results from a large 827-nucleotide genomic deletion. The phenotypic characterization of propagation capacity through plaque count- and NGS-based competitive propagation assay supported the higher propagation rate of Ph-WSLGYTG clone compared with the library. According to our data, white plaques are likely to arise endogenously in Ph.D. libraries due to mutations in the M13KE genome and should not always be viewed as exogenous contamination. Our findings also led to the conclusion that the deletion observed here might be an ancestral mutation already present in the na\u00efve library, which causes target-unrelated nonspecific enrichment of white clone during biopanning due to propagation advantage."

                "tldr": "The success of phage display antibody discovery is influenced by multiple factors during selection and screening phases, including binding conditions, amplification bias, target complexity, and screening methodology. Addressing these challenges through optimized selection strategies and advanced screening technologies is critical for isolating antibodies with both desired binding properties and favorable developability characteristics. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe effectiveness of phage display antibody discovery is significantly impacted by factors that influence both the selection (binding) and amplification phases of the biopanning process. Ideally, selection would be dominated by binding affinity, with all retrieved clones amplifying equally during propagation. However, in reality, amplification efficiency varies widely among different antibody sequences, and after multiple rounds of panning, the output repertoire often includes rapidly amplified sequences with low or no binding activity, significantly diminishing discovery efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"249328057\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis amplification bias represents a major challenge in phage display, as fast-propagating clones can become overrepresented during library amplification, leading to target-unrelated enrichment <Paper corpusId=\"259311093\" paperTitle=\"(Palma, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"247606549\" paperTitle=\"(Sell et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to use the original phage from the library generation rather than reamplified phage for repeated selection campaigns, as reamplification biases the library toward clones with higher expression rates <Paper corpusId=\"273373241\" paperTitle=\"(Peng et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTarget complexity presents another significant challenge, particularly when using whole cells for phenotypic discovery. In these cases, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies binding potentially hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the enrichment process results in extremely complex output pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant while the majority are very rare. This creates a substantial challenge during screening, as only a fraction of antibodies can be tested using conventional binding analysis, typically identifying only the most abundant clones binding to one or a few targets <Paper corpusId=\"198963158\" paperTitle=\"(Ljungars et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe evolution of selection and screening strategies reflects a significant shift in priorities. While early phage display campaigns focused primarily on selecting antibodies with high specificity and affinity, the field has recognized that additional properties significantly impact therapeutic success. These \"developability\" properties include cross-reactivity against human targets and orthologs from relevant toxicology species, solubility, expression yield, and thermal and long-term stability <Paper corpusId=\"202024685\" paperTitle=\"(Almagro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdvanced screening methods have been developed to address these challenges. Deep sequencing of unselected and selected phage libraries using next-generation sequencing platforms allows for in-depth evaluation of enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions <Paper corpusId=\"3155125\" paperTitle=\"(Hu et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach enables more efficient identification of beneficial mutations during affinity maturation campaigns and helps overcome the limitations of traditional screening methods.\n\nThe complexity of screening is further influenced by library design factors such as the length and nature (linear versus cyclic) of displayed peptides, which significantly impact selection outcomes. Shorter peptides offer increased flexibility but may have lower affinities and more nonspecific interactions, while longer peptides provide more interaction potential but may face structural constraints <Paper corpusId=\"259311093\" paperTitle=\"(Palma, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these challenges, continuing innovations are improving phage display selection and screening. These include creating more diverse phage libraries, optimizing selection methods, and integrating advanced screening techniques to target complex biological environments <Paper corpusId=\"272630189\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214187873\" paperTitle=\"(Simonetti et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252893100\" paperTitle=\"(Miki et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259844290\" paperTitle=\"(Guerlavais et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Pattern enrichment analysis, for instance, allows comparison of selected versus unselected sequence datasets with high coverage, facilitating identification of key binding residues <Paper corpusId=\"252893100\" paperTitle=\"(Miki et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSpecialized approaches have also been developed for particular applications, such as membrane protein targeting. These involve selecting \"specialized\" libraries containing phage-displayed antibodies that bind to membrane proteins, followed by efficient differential screening using minimal amounts of biological samples <Paper corpusId=\"8071794\" paperTitle=\"(Monaci et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>. Such targeted approaches help overcome the inherent challenges of selecting against complex targets in competitive environments.",

                            "The length and linear/cyclic nature of displayed peptides in phage display have a significant impact on the selection outcome. Shorter peptides offer increased flexibility but may have lower affinities and more nonspecific interactions [34], while longer peptides provide more interaction potential but may face constraints and hindrances. Cyclic peptides exhibit enhanced stability and rigidity (Joo, 2012), leading to improved affinities and resistance to degradation, whereas linear peptides offer flexibility and conformational diversity. Optimal peptide length and conformation vary based on the target and experimental conditions. Researchers must carefully consider these factors during library design to enhance the chances of identifying peptides with desired binding properties in phage display selections",
                            "While phage display is a powerful technique for identifying epitopes, there are some disadvantages to consider. One potential issue is the risk of false positives or false negatives due to the complexity of the screening process (Sell et al., 2022). This can occur if the phage library is not sufficiently diverse or if the screening conditions are not optimized for the specific antibody or epitope of interest. Additionally, the size of the phage library and the number of potential epitopes to screen can be a limitation, as large libraries may require extensive sequencing and analysis, and the screening process may miss rare or low-affinity epitopes."

                            "The nonspecific enrichment of target-unrelated peptides during biopanning remains a major drawback for phage display technology. The commercial Ph.D.TM-7 phage display library is used extensively for peptide discovery. This library is based on the M13KE vector, which carries the lacZ\u03b1 sequence, leading to the formation of blue plaques on IPTG-X-gal agar plates. In the current study, we report the isolation of a fast-propagating white clone (displaying WSLGYTG peptide) identified through screening against a recombinant protein. Sanger sequencing demonstrated that white plaques are not contamination from environmental M13-like phages, but derive from the library itself. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the white color of the plaques results from a large 827-nucleotide genomic deletion. The phenotypic characterization of propagation capacity through plaque count- and NGS-based competitive propagation assay supported the higher propagation rate of Ph-WSLGYTG clone compared with the library. According to our data, white plaques are likely to arise endogenously in Ph.D. libraries due to mutations in the M13KE genome and should not always be viewed as exogenous contamination. Our findings also led to the conclusion that the deletion observed here might be an ancestral mutation already present in the na\u00efve library, which causes target-unrelated nonspecific enrichment of white clone during biopanning due to propagation advantage."

                            "Initially, the main goal of phage display antibody discovery campaigns was to select for specific and high affinity antibodies [17]. In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18]19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable."

                            "Phage display technology has been widely used for antibody affinity maturation for decades. The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions."

                            "Phage display is the most widely used technique to discover de novo peptides that bind to target proteins. However, it is associated with some challenges such as compositional bias. In this study, to overcome these difficulties, we devised a \u2018pattern enrichment analysis.\u2019 In this method, two samples (one obtained by affinity selection, the other simply amplified without selection) are prepared, and the two sequence datasets read on next-generation sequencer are compared to find the three-residue pattern most enriched in the selected sample. This allows us to compare two sequence datasets with high coverage and facilitates the identification of peptide sequences and the key residues for binding. We also demonstrated that this approach in the combination with structured peptide libraries allowed spatial mapping of the enriched sequence patterns. Here, we prepared a phage library displaying chemically stapled helical peptides with the X1C2X3X4X5X6X7X8C9X10 sequence, where X is any amino acid. To validate our method, we performed screening against the HDM2 protein. The results showed that the hydrophobic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp and Leu) that are key to interactions with HDM2 were clearly identified by the pattern enrichment analysis. We also performed selection targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in the same manner. The results showed that similar patterns were enriched among the hit peptides that inhibited the protein\u2013protein interaction."

                            "We report the discovery of sulanemadlin (ALRN-6924), the first cell-permeating, stabilized \u03b1-helical peptide to enter clinical trials. ALRN-6924 is a \"stapled peptide\" that mimics the N-terminal domain of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. It binds with high affinity to both MDM2 and MDMX (also known as MDM4), the endogenous inhibitors of p53, to activate p53 signaling in cells having a non-mutant, or wild-type TP53 genotype (TP53-WT). Iterative structure-activity optimization endowed ALRN-6924 with favorable cell permeability, solubility, and pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Intracellular proteolysis of ALRN-6924 forms a long-acting active metabolite with potent MDM2 and MDMX binding affinity and slow dissociation kinetics. At high doses, ALRN-6924 exhibits on-mechanism anticancer activity in TP53-WT tumor models. At lower doses, ALRN-6924 transiently arrests the cell cycle in healthy tissues to protect them from chemotherapy without protecting the TP53-mutant cancer cells. These results support the continued clinical evaluation of ALRN-6924 as an anticancer and chemoprotection agent."

The second critical element is the development of a technology that enables an efficient differential screening of phage clones, using minimal amounts of biological samples.\n\nWe generated the Membranome collection by panning a phage-Ab library on cultured cells This process simultaneously selects ligands for several cell surface receptors. The complexity of the library, the display level of the target receptor on the cell surface and the affinity of the interaction between phage-Ab and the target receptor strongly affect this process. All these factors interact in a competitive environment where biological viability of the phage-Ab also plays a major role.\n\nThe amino acid sequence of VH3-CDR3, the hypervariable region which in most cases acts as a major binding determinant [6][7][8], is a unique and distinctive feature of each member of the repository. The Membranome phage-Ab collection hosts VH-CDR3 sequences ranging from 3 to 25 residues, with the frequency peaking around 10 residues, and analysis of the complete scFv region reveals a broad set of germline families. Together these two findings indicate that a wide variety of binding motifs are present in the collection."
