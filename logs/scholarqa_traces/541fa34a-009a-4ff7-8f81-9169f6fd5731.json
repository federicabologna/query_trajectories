The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.",

                    "text": "Production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins. One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation [25][26][27]. The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies [10,26,28,29]. The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding [30]. Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins [31]. It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32].",

                    "text": "E. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.\n## Plasmids carrying molecular chaperones for optimization of protein folding\nProduction of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins. One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation [25][26][27]. The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies [10,26,28,29]. The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding [30]. Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins [31]. It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32].\n\n## Future perspectives\nE. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

This occurrence is attributed to the rapid rate of protein expression in E. coli which surpasses the availability of chaperone proteins and reduced cytoplasmic conditions. The formation of inclusion bodies can reduce the recovery of soluble protein. A combination of GroEL/ES and trigger factor chaperone co-expression was used to overcome this deficiency.

Consequently, intracellular protein expression is often employed as a method to enhance recombinant protein production. However, intracellular protein expression in E. coli is subject to certain limitations, such as the formation of inclusion bodies. Multiple factors influence the formation of these inclusion bodies, including misfolding of proteins, low levels of chaperones, which impede proper protein conformation under reduced cytoplasmic conditions, and susceptibility to degradation by proteases [14]. To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19]. \n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24].",

Maksum, Dian Utami, Sriwidodo Sriwidodo, Ryan Adibagus Haryanto, R. D. Pratiwi\n## Abstract\nThe Thermus thermophilus (Tth) DNA polymerase enzyme, originating from the thermophilic bacterium T. thermophilus, exhibits bifunctionally as both a DNA polymerase and a reverse transcriptase. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the T. thermophilus DNA polymerase enzyme frequently results in the formation of inclusion bodies. This occurrence is attributed to the rapid rate of protein expression in E. coli which surpasses the availability of chaperone proteins and reduced cytoplasmic conditions. The formation of inclusion bodies can reduce the recovery of soluble protein. A combination of GroEL/ES and trigger factor chaperone co-expression was used to overcome this deficiency. Thermus thermophilus gene DNA Pol/pG-Tf3 was transformed into the host E. coli BL21(DE3) and expressed with and without chaperone co-expression. Utilizing co-expression of the chaperone combination GroEL/ ES and trigger factor can reduce the formation of inclusion bodies or decrease the insoluble fraction in the expression of the T. thermophilus DNA polymerase enzyme, resulting in a co-expression total protein content of 3.9258 mg/ml.\n## RESULT AND DISCUSSION [pG-TF3] plasmid transformation into host E. coli BL21(DE3) [pD861-His Tth DNA Pol] using heat shock method\nIn this research, the heat shock method was used due to its advantages, which include not requiring specialized expression. Consequently, intracellular protein expression is often employed as a method to enhance recombinant protein production. However, intracellular protein expression in E. coli is subject to certain limitations, such as the formation of inclusion bodies. Multiple factors influence the formation of these inclusion bodies, including misfolding of proteins, low levels of chaperones, which impede proper protein conformation under reduced cytoplasmic conditions, and susceptibility to degradation by proteases [14]. To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19]. \n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24].",

A strategy was explored to overcome inclusion-body formation observed when expressing an aggregation-prone fungal xylanase in Escherichia coli. pHsh is an expression plasmid that uses a synthetic heat-shock (Hsh) promoter, in which gene expression is regulated by an alternative sigma factor (\u03c332). A derivative of pHsh was constructed by fusing a signal peptide to xynA2 gene to facilitate export of the recombinant protein to the periplasm. The xylanase was produced in a soluble form. Three factors were essential to achieving such soluble expression of the xylanase: 1) the target gene was under the control of the Hsh promoter, 2) the gene product was exported into the periplasm, and 3) gene expression was induced by a temperature upshift. For the first time we report the expression of periplasmic proteins under the control of an Hsh promoter regulated by \u03c332. One unique feature of this approach was that over 200 copies of the Hsh promoter in an E. coli cell significantly increased the concentration of \u03c332. The growth inhibition of the recombinant cells corresponded to an increase in the levels of soluble periplasmic protein. Therefore, an alternative protocol was designed to induce gene expression from pHsh-ex to obtain high levels of active soluble enzymes.",

Shao\n## Abstract\nThe development of new procedures and protocols that allow researchers to obtain recombinant proteins is of fundamental importance in the biotechnology field. A strategy was explored to overcome inclusion-body formation observed when expressing an aggregation-prone fungal xylanase in Escherichia coli. pHsh is an expression plasmid that uses a synthetic heat-shock (Hsh) promoter, in which gene expression is regulated by an alternative sigma factor (\u03c332). A derivative of pHsh was constructed by fusing a signal peptide to xynA2 gene to facilitate export of the recombinant protein to the periplasm. The xylanase was produced in a soluble form. Three factors were essential to achieving such soluble expression of the xylanase: 1) the target gene was under the control of the Hsh promoter, 2) the gene product was exported into the periplasm, and 3) gene expression was induced by a temperature upshift. For the first time we report the expression of periplasmic proteins under the control of an Hsh promoter regulated by \u03c332. One unique feature of this approach was that over 200 copies of the Hsh promoter in an E. coli cell significantly increased the concentration of \u03c332. The growth inhibition of the recombinant cells corresponded to an increase in the levels of soluble periplasmic protein. Therefore, an alternative protocol was designed to induce gene expression from pHsh-ex to obtain high levels of active soluble enzymes.\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1].

A high-throughput (HTP) strategy was used to isolate and clone 1476 genes obtained from a diverse library of recombinant CAZymes covering a variety of sequence-based families, enzyme classes, and source organisms. All genes were successfully isolated by either PCR (61%) or gene synthesis (GS) (39%) and were subsequently cloned into Escherichia coli expression vectors. Most proteins (79%) were obtained at a good yield during recombinant expression. A significantly lower number (p < 0.01) of proteins from eukaryotic (57.7%) and archaeal (53.3%) origin were soluble compared to bacteria (79.7%). Genes obtained by GS gave a significantly lower number (p = 0.04) of soluble proteins while the green fluorescent protein tag improved protein solubility (p = 0.05). Finally, a relationship between the amino acid composition and protein solubility was observed. Thus, a lower percentage of non-polar and higher percentage of negatively charged amino acids in a protein may be a good predictor for higher protein solubility in E. coli. The HTP approach presented here is a powerful tool for producing recombinant CAZymes that can be used for future studies of plant cell wall degradation. Successful production and expression of soluble recombinant proteins at a high rate opens new possibilities for the high-throughput production of targets from limitless sources.",

                    "text": "Many studies have focused on optimizing the production processes for recombinant proteins, with the aim of reducing the accumulation of insoluble inclusion bodies. In contrast, solubilization and refolding of protein from inclusion bodies is a common strategy although it requires denaturing conditions and a subsequent renaturing step, usually resulting in poor soluble protein recoveries [32,33]. Different approaches have been developed to prevent the accumulation of inclusion bodies in E. coli, such as the optimization of culture conditions, co-expression with molecular chaperones [34,35], lower growth temperature during gene induction [35,36], induction expression in early-log phase culture [37], and induction with lower levels of inducer concentration, such as Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [38]. In addition, several fusion tags have been developed to increase the solubility of overexpressed proteins, although with variable degrees of success. Currently, available fusion systems include maltose-binding polypeptide (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ubiquitin (SUMO), thioredoxin (TrxA), and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) [39]. The use of a fusion partner may increase the solubility of the protein and may significantly contribute to an increase in the expression yields under different conditions. The data presented here revealed a higher number (p = 0.05) of proteins obtained in the soluble form when fused with GFP tag (pHTP9) (Figure 3C) compared with proteins that only included a histidine tag (pHTP1). Although this suggests higher solubility through the expression with the GFP fusion, only a controlled study in which the same proteins are expressed in the fusion with the two different fusion tags would allow a more insightful elucidation of the impact of GFP on protein solubility.",

Cardoso, J. Br\u00e1s, In\u00eas F. Costa, L. Ferreira, L. T. Gama, R. Vincentelli, B. Henrissat, C. Fontes\n## Abstract\nIn nature, the deconstruction of plant carbohydrates is carried out by carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). A high-throughput (HTP) strategy was used to isolate and clone 1476 genes obtained from a diverse library of recombinant CAZymes covering a variety of sequence-based families, enzyme classes, and source organisms. All genes were successfully isolated by either PCR (61%) or gene synthesis (GS) (39%) and were subsequently cloned into Escherichia coli expression vectors. Most proteins (79%) were obtained at a good yield during recombinant expression. A significantly lower number (p < 0.01) of proteins from eukaryotic (57.7%) and archaeal (53.3%) origin were soluble compared to bacteria (79.7%). Genes obtained by GS gave a significantly lower number (p = 0.04) of soluble proteins while the green fluorescent protein tag improved protein solubility (p = 0.05). Finally, a relationship between the amino acid composition and protein solubility was observed. Thus, a lower percentage of non-polar and higher percentage of negatively charged amino acids in a protein may be a good predictor for higher protein solubility in E. coli. The HTP approach presented here is a powerful tool for producing recombinant CAZymes that can be used for future studies of plant cell wall degradation. Successful production and expression of soluble recombinant proteins at a high rate opens new possibilities for the high-throughput production of targets from limitless sources.\n## Does the GFP Tag Promote Protein Production?\nMany studies have focused on optimizing the production processes for recombinant proteins, with the aim of reducing the accumulation of insoluble inclusion bodies. In contrast, solubilization and refolding of protein from inclusion bodies is a common strategy although it requires denaturing conditions and a subsequent renaturing step, usually resulting in poor soluble protein recoveries [32,33]. Different approaches have been developed to prevent the accumulation of inclusion bodies in E. coli, such as the optimization of culture conditions, co-expression with molecular chaperones [34,35], lower growth temperature during gene induction [35,36], induction expression in early-log phase culture [37], and induction with lower levels of inducer concentration, such as Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [38]. In addition, several fusion tags have been developed to increase the solubility of overexpressed proteins, although with variable degrees of success. Currently, available fusion systems include maltose-binding polypeptide (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ubiquitin (SUMO), thioredoxin (TrxA), and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) [39]. The use of a fusion partner may increase the solubility of the protein and may significantly contribute to an increase in the expression yields under different conditions. The data presented here revealed a higher number (p = 0.05) of proteins obtained in the soluble form when fused with GFP tag (pHTP9) (Figure 3C) compared with proteins that only included a histidine tag (pHTP1). Although this suggests higher solubility through the expression with the GFP fusion, only a controlled study in which the same proteins are expressed in the fusion with the two different fusion tags would allow a more insightful elucidation of the impact of GFP on protein solubility.",

Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO).ResultsWe have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191\u2013345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively.ConclusionThe refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.",

Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO).ResultsWe have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191\u2013345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively.ConclusionThe refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.",

However, some key enzymes involved in biotransformation processes are unstable and cannot be easily expressed in the functional form. In this study, we describe a versatile platform for enzyme stabilization inside the cell: Intracellularly Immobilized Enzyme System (IIES). A 1,2-fucosyltransferase from Pedobactor saltans (PsFL) and a 1,3-fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori (HpFL), chosen as model proteins, were fused with Oct-1 DNA-binding domain, which mediated the formation of a plasmid\u2013protein complex. Oct-1 fusion enabled both soluble and stable expression of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm because the fusion proteins were stabilized on the plasmid like immobilized enzymes bound to solid surface. As a result, Oct-1-fusion proteins exhibited significantly greater product titer and yield than non-fusion proteins. Use of fusion proteins PsFL-Oct-1 with C-terminal Oct-1 and Oct-1-PsFL with N-terminal Oct-1 resulted in ~3- and ~2-fold higher 2\u2032-fucosyllactose titers, respectively, than with the use of PsFL alone. When Oct-1 was fused to HpFL, which requires dimerization through heptad repeats, almost two times more 3-fucosyllactose was produced. Fucosyllactose has been used as a food additive because it has various beneficial effects on human health. We anticipate that IIES using Oct-1 fusion protein developed in this study can be applied to stabilize other unstable enzymes.",

Jeong, Sun-Ki Kim, Dae-Hyuk Kweon\n## Abstract\nRecombinant whole-cell biocatalysts are widely used for biotransformation of valuable products. However, some key enzymes involved in biotransformation processes are unstable and cannot be easily expressed in the functional form. In this study, we describe a versatile platform for enzyme stabilization inside the cell: Intracellularly Immobilized Enzyme System (IIES). A 1,2-fucosyltransferase from Pedobactor saltans (PsFL) and a 1,3-fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori (HpFL), chosen as model proteins, were fused with Oct-1 DNA-binding domain, which mediated the formation of a plasmid\u2013protein complex. Oct-1 fusion enabled both soluble and stable expression of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm because the fusion proteins were stabilized on the plasmid like immobilized enzymes bound to solid surface. As a result, Oct-1-fusion proteins exhibited significantly greater product titer and yield than non-fusion proteins. Use of fusion proteins PsFL-Oct-1 with C-terminal Oct-1 and Oct-1-PsFL with N-terminal Oct-1 resulted in ~3- and ~2-fold higher 2\u2032-fucosyllactose titers, respectively, than with the use of PsFL alone. When Oct-1 was fused to HpFL, which requires dimerization through heptad repeats, almost two times more 3-fucosyllactose was produced. Fucosyllactose has been used as a food additive because it has various beneficial effects on human health. We anticipate that IIES using Oct-1 fusion protein developed in this study can be applied to stabilize other unstable enzymes.\n## INTRODUCTION\nEscherichia coli is generally the first choice of host for the production of proteins and chemicals, because of its fast growth rate, a well-established expression system, high production yield, and low manufacturing cost.

In an attempt to minimize IB formation and thus shift production towards soluble protein versions, many strategies have been proposed, including genetic approaches (e.g., reduction of gene dosage or gene expression rates), physical methods (e.g., lowering the culture temperature), physiological methodologies (e.g., co-producing chaperones and folding modulators) and nutrient availability (e.g., carbon source limitation) [2,3]. The success in the application of these procedures is not predictable, since being variable and product-linked they have not led into a universally established protocol applicable to all IB-forming proteins. On the other hand, IBs are mechanically stable protein deposits. They can be easily isolated upon cell disruption by simple physical means and used as a relatively pure source of recombinant protein which can be transformed into the active soluble form by solubilisation and subsequent refolding. For example, the first recombinant protein approved by the FDA for human application was insulin, the two chains produced in separate E. coli strains as fusion proteins forming IBs. Still today, human insulin is produced using two major routes. One route involves the production of a precursor in form of IBs using E. coli as production host with subsequent solubilization and refolding [4].",

In an attempt to minimize IB formation and thus shift production towards soluble protein versions, many strategies have been proposed, including genetic approaches (e.g., reduction of gene dosage or gene expression rates), physical methods (e.g., lowering the culture temperature), physiological methodologies (e.g., co-producing chaperones and folding modulators) and nutrient availability (e.g., carbon source limitation) [2,3]. The success in the application of these procedures is not predictable, since being variable and product-linked they have not led into a universally established protocol applicable to all IB-forming proteins. On the other hand, IBs are mechanically stable protein deposits. They can be easily isolated upon cell disruption by simple physical means and used as a relatively pure source of recombinant protein which can be transformed into the active soluble form by solubilisation and subsequent refolding. For example, the first recombinant protein approved by the FDA for human application was insulin, the two chains produced in separate E. coli strains as fusion proteins forming IBs. Still today, human insulin is produced using two major routes. One route involves the production of a precursor in form of IBs using E. coli as production host with subsequent solubilization and refolding [4].",

For expressed cases, the models further predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant protein production core facility, where six different vectors were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.ConclusionIn this paper, we show that a machine learning approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a target protein in a recombinant protein production system is promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study of the efficacy.

Until recently, significant efforts have been made to improve the recovery of active hGH from inclusion bodies. Here, we developed an efficient procedure for the production of completely soluble hGH by minimizing the formation of inclusion bodies and optimizing protein purification conditions. Under the newly established conditions we were able to obtain most of the total hGH in the soluble fraction. We show that the soluble protein can be efficiently purified in high yield by a series of chromatographic procedures. We analyzed the resulting hGH using various analytical techniques such as reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism (CD). These multiple analyses support the conclusion that we obtained highly pure hGH with the expected molecular mass and intact secondary structure. The biological activity of purified hGH was also confirmed by evaluating its growth-promoting effect using a cell proliferation assay. Taken together, we describe a straightforward strategy for the production of completely soluble and biologically active hGH in E. coli.",

We observed that most of the hGH was found in the insoluble fraction (lane P; pellet fraction), and there was a very small amount of soluble hGH (lane S; soluble fraction). To increase the yield of soluble protein, the protein expression conditions can be optimized by varying induction temperatures, inducer concentrations and media compositions [21]. In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins [22]. Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies. We observed efficient expression of hGH with a 5-fold increase in solubility upon induction at 16uC for 16 h (Figure 1B), and thus those conditions were used in subsequent experiments. We also determined whether the formation of inclusion bodies could be reduced by lowering IPTG concentration (to 0.1 mM). The results indicate that reducing IPTG concentration is not as effective as lowering induction temperature at preventing the formation of inclusion bodies under our conditions (Figure S1). \n\nAs a substantial amount of hGH was still found in the insoluble fraction, we examined whether the pelleted hGH could be recovered by optimizing protein extraction. Although the formation of inclusion bodies may be further reduced by optimizing environmental factors such as culture media [21] or genetic engineering [23,24], we reasoned that the observed protein aggregation may involve some other factors such as non-specific protein interactions. To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented [25]. We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure. As shown in Figure 2A, the use of Triton X-100 significantly increased the solubility of hGH expressed at low temperature.",

Park, K. Seo, Hyo-Jin Yang, Sook\u2010Kyung Kim, Jun-Hyuk Choi\n## Abstract\nHigh-level expression of recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates as inclusion bodies devoid of biological activity. Until recently, significant efforts have been made to improve the recovery of active hGH from inclusion bodies. Here, we developed an efficient procedure for the production of completely soluble hGH by minimizing the formation of inclusion bodies and optimizing protein purification conditions. Under the newly established conditions we were able to obtain most of the total hGH in the soluble fraction. We show that the soluble protein can be efficiently purified in high yield by a series of chromatographic procedures. We analyzed the resulting hGH using various analytical techniques such as reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and circular dichroism (CD). These multiple analyses support the conclusion that we obtained highly pure hGH with the expected molecular mass and intact secondary structure. The biological activity of purified hGH was also confirmed by evaluating its growth-promoting effect using a cell proliferation assay. Taken together, we describe a straightforward strategy for the production of completely soluble and biologically active hGH in E. coli.\n## Solubilization of recombinant hGH under various conditions\nIn agreement with previous studies, we confirmed significant accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates as inclusion bodies upon high-level expression of hGH in E. coli (Figure 1). We observed that most of the hGH was found in the insoluble fraction (lane P; pellet fraction), and there was a very small amount of soluble hGH (lane S; soluble fraction). To increase the yield of soluble protein, the protein expression conditions can be optimized by varying induction temperatures, inducer concentrations and media compositions [21]. In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins [22]. Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies. We observed efficient expression of hGH with a 5-fold increase in solubility upon induction at 16uC for 16 h (Figure 1B), and thus those conditions were used in subsequent experiments. We also determined whether the formation of inclusion bodies could be reduced by lowering IPTG concentration (to 0.1 mM). The results indicate that reducing IPTG concentration is not as effective as lowering induction temperature at preventing the formation of inclusion bodies under our conditions (Figure S1). \n\nAs a substantial amount of hGH was still found in the insoluble fraction, we examined whether the pelleted hGH could be recovered by optimizing protein extraction. Although the formation of inclusion bodies may be further reduced by optimizing environmental factors such as culture media [21] or genetic engineering [23,24], we reasoned that the observed protein aggregation may involve some other factors such as non-specific protein interactions. To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented [25]. We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure. As shown in Figure 2A, the use of Triton X-100 significantly increased the solubility of hGH expressed at low temperature.\n\n## Discussion\nE. coli has been efficiently used for the high-yield production of many recombinant proteins. However, high-level expression often leads to insoluble protein aggregates such as inclusion bodies, and  thus requires additional steps including solubilization and refolding prior to purification. Although the formation of inclusion bodies has certain advantages such as convenient isolation and protection from proteolysis, the recovery of biological activity has often been unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the resolubilization of protein aggregates can be problematic, requires the use of high concentrations of denaturants, and the subsequent refolding process generally requires extensive optimization. \n\nIn this study, we demonstrated the efficient preparation of soluble hGH directly from the E. coli cytoplasmic space under optimized conditions where protein aggregation was minimized.

While formation of inclusion bodies is beneficial in protein isolation from other cellular components, most of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies are misfolded which have lost their biological activity. Protein refolding allows misfolded protein to rearrange into their native conformation which exhibit its biological activity, thus protein refolding become a pivotal step to recover active protein. However, protein refolding was affected by various factors; hence, screening of refolding condition was required to meet the optimal result. As a consequence, rapid and efficient characterization method is required to monitor the refolding performance. In this review, we will briefly give an overview about protein refolding method, chemical additives in protein refolding, and also provide insight in structural characterization to evaluate refolding performance.",

Maksum\n## Abstract\nAmong bacterial expression system, Escherichia coli was the popular and widely used expression host due to its high rate expression trait. However, overexpression of recombinant protein in E. coli often found as inclusion bodies. While formation of inclusion bodies is beneficial in protein isolation from other cellular components, most of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies are misfolded which have lost their biological activity. Protein refolding allows misfolded protein to rearrange into their native conformation which exhibit its biological activity, thus protein refolding become a pivotal step to recover active protein. However, protein refolding was affected by various factors; hence, screening of refolding condition was required to meet the optimal result. As a consequence, rapid and efficient characterization method is required to monitor the refolding performance. In this review, we will briefly give an overview about protein refolding method, chemical additives in protein refolding, and also provide insight in structural characterization to evaluate refolding performance.\n## CONCLUSION\nExpression of recombinant protein in E. coli is favored due to its high-yield product. However, its nature to form inclusion bodies during the process becomes a challenge, since inclusion bodies are mostly biologically inactive. Solubilizing the insoluble inclusion bodies and further refolding processes are required to obtain an active protein. The method for protein refolding is vary, such as dilution, dialysis, chromatography-based method, usage of immobilization folding catalyst, and artificial chaperones, and also enzyme-assisted refolding is among the available methods which offer different and unique advantages and disadvantages. Chemical additives also play role to improve the refolding process. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield, while oxo-shuffling agents such as GSH/GSSG, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT sometimes used to promote disulfide shuffling to obtain proper disulfide bridge pairs. Monitoring the refolding process was conducted by characterizing the protein structure. However, performing a rapid and accurate characterization sometimes become a challenge, in fact, both criteria are occasionally exchanging each other. Therefore, in this review, we briefly discussed protein refolding along with its structural characterization method.",

Traditional markets include the food and feed industry, but enzymatic processes are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as fine chemical production and pharmaceutical industries [1]. Cost-efficient high-yield production of the biocatalysts, usually by heterologous expression in bacterial or yeast systems, is critical for the economic viability of such processes. The choice of the production host depends on several properties of the target protein itself. If posttranslational modifications are not required, prokaryotic systems like E. coli are most attractive due to high productivity, low cost and easy handling. However, overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria can cause problems like the production of insoluble aggregates of misfolded and inactive proteins called inclusion bodies (IB). Inclusion bodies consist of the overproduced polypeptide aggregated with small amounts of foreign proteins and nucleic acids [2]. Strategies for resolving this problem and for optimizing expression levels in E. coli have already been reported [3][4][5][6][7] and include the application of well-characterized expression systems under the control of tightly regulated promoters as well as the application of different expression conditions. In general, reduced cell growth, caused by lowered temperatures or oxygen limitation, promotes the expression of complex heterologous proteins in an active and soluble form and reduces IB formation [8][9][10][11]. Overdrive of inducer, on the other hand, results in IB formation and cell damage, whereas limited induction is favorable for native enzyme production [12]. Refolding of IB is widely discussed in literature [13,14], but is not possible for every given protein. \n\nIn this study we analyzed different expression systems for the production of recombinant pyranose 2-oxidase (POx; pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase; glucose 2-oxidase; EC 1.1.3.10) from Trametes multicolor in the prokaryotic host E. coli.",

However, overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria can cause problems like the production of insoluble aggregates of misfolded and inactive proteins called inclusion bodies (IB). Inclusion bodies consist of the overproduced polypeptide aggregated with small amounts of foreign proteins and nucleic acids [2]. Strategies for resolving this problem and for optimizing expression levels in E. coli have already been reported [3][4][5][6][7] and include the application of well-characterized expression systems under the control of tightly regulated promoters as well as the application of different expression conditions. In general, reduced cell growth, caused by lowered temperatures or oxygen limitation, promotes the expression of complex heterologous proteins in an active and soluble form and reduces IB formation [8][9][10][11]. Overdrive of inducer, on the other hand, results in IB formation and cell damage, whereas limited induction is favorable for native enzyme production [12]. Refolding of IB is widely discussed in literature [13,14], but is not possible for every given protein. \n\nIn this study we analyzed different expression systems for the production of recombinant pyranose 2-oxidase (POx; pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase; glucose 2-oxidase; EC 1.1.3.10) from Trametes multicolor in the prokaryotic host E. coli.",

RMPs usually consisting of linear, immunodominant, and phylogenetically conserved epitopes, has been applied in the experimental diagnosis of various human and animal diseases, such as leishmaniasis, brucellosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, hepatitis, leptospirosis, leprosy, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and COVID-19. The synthetic genes for these epitopes are joined to code a single RMP, either with spacers or fused, with different biochemical properties. The epitopes\u2019 high density within the RMPs contributes to a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The RMPs can also sidestep the need for multiple peptide synthesis or multiple recombinant proteins, reducing costs and enhancing the standardization conditions for immunoassays. Methods such as bioinformatics and circular dichroism have been widely applied in the development of new RMPs, helping to guide their construction and better understand their structure. Several RMPs have been expressed, mainly using the Escherichia coli expression system, highlighting the importance of these cells in the biotechnological field. In fact, technological advances in this area, offering a wide range of different strains to be used, make these cells the most widely used expression platform. RMPs have been experimentally used to diagnose a broad range of illnesses in the laboratory, suggesting they could also be useful for accurate diagnoses commercially. On this point, the RMP method offers a tempting substitute for the production of promising antigens used to assemble commercial diagnostic kits.",

RMPs usually consisting of linear, immunodominant, and phylogenetically conserved epitopes, has been applied in the experimental diagnosis of various human and animal diseases, such as leishmaniasis, brucellosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, hepatitis, leptospirosis, leprosy, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and COVID-19. The synthetic genes for these epitopes are joined to code a single RMP, either with spacers or fused, with different biochemical properties. The epitopes\u2019 high density within the RMPs contributes to a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The RMPs can also sidestep the need for multiple peptide synthesis or multiple recombinant proteins, reducing costs and enhancing the standardization conditions for immunoassays. Methods such as bioinformatics and circular dichroism have been widely applied in the development of new RMPs, helping to guide their construction and better understand their structure. Several RMPs have been expressed, mainly using the Escherichia coli expression system, highlighting the importance of these cells in the biotechnological field. In fact, technological advances in this area, offering a wide range of different strains to be used, make these cells the most widely used expression platform. RMPs have been experimentally used to diagnose a broad range of illnesses in the laboratory, suggesting they could also be useful for accurate diagnoses commercially. On this point, the RMP method offers a tempting substitute for the production of promising antigens used to assemble commercial diagnostic kits.\n## Escherichia coli: the platform of choice for RMP production\nThese examples demonstrate the ability to address codon usage issues by selecting suitable lineages without entirely replacing the gene codons planning.\n\nA problem with folding errors that is routinely described in the literature is the inclusion bodies occurrence due to misfolded recombinant proteins.Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143].The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144].As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies.Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains.For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145].The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources.This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids.The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148].Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149].These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31,40].",

Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. As inclusion bodies contain relatively pure and intact proteins, protein refolding is an important process to obtain active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, conventional refolding methods, such as dialysis and dilution, are time consuming and, often, recovered yields of active proteins are low, and a trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. Recently, several approaches have been reported to refold these aggregated proteins into an active form. The strategies largely aim at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This review focuses on protein refolding techniques using chemical additives and laminar flow in microfluidic chips for the efficient recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies.",

Yamaguchi, M. Miyazaki\n## Abstract\nBiologically active proteins are useful for studying the biological functions of genes and for the development of therapeutic drugs and biomaterials in a biotechnology industry. Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. As inclusion bodies contain relatively pure and intact proteins, protein refolding is an important process to obtain active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, conventional refolding methods, such as dialysis and dilution, are time consuming and, often, recovered yields of active proteins are low, and a trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. Recently, several approaches have been reported to refold these aggregated proteins into an active form. The strategies largely aim at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This review focuses on protein refolding techniques using chemical additives and laminar flow in microfluidic chips for the efficient recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies.\n## Introduction\nThe expression of recombinant proteins is important for the study of the biological functions of genes, the development of therapeutic drugs [1], and for industrial processes [2].There are several protein expression systems to produce the target proteins, such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems.Expression in mammalian cells and insect cells produces biologically active proteins that contain post-translational modification(s), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation.However, expression using these systems gives low yields of the recombinant proteins, and the cost of these systems is generally expensive for industrial-scale protein production.Cell-free systems also give low yields of the recombinant proteins.Among the cell-free systems, the Escherichia coli (E.coli) overexpression system is the most convenient and frequently used to produce recombinant proteins [1,3].\n\nRecombinant proteins often require the assistance of folding modulators, such as chaperone proteins, during expression in E. coli.In the overexpression system, the rate of protein aggregation is often much greater than that of proper folding and chaperone proteins are rapidly used up [4].These protein aggregates are called inclusion bodies.As the target proteins are usually purified from soluble fractions in bacteria cell lysates, the formation of inclusion bodies is often a drawback in the use of E. coli expression systems [2].Changing the growth conditions, such as growth temperature, concentration of inducer, and induction time, can often help in decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies (insoluble fraction of the proteins).Recently, it has been reported that recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the soluble form in the expression system by adding compatible solutes (chemical additives) in the expression medium [5].Instead of forming inclusion bodies, the target protein could be expressed as a soluble protein in the presence of sorbitol, arginine, and trehalose in the expression medium [5].It is expected that appropriate additives can suppress the formation of inclusion bodies and, thus, increase the solubility of target proteins in E. coli overexpression systems.",

Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within the producing bacteria. We evaluated how the initial culture density, temperature and duration of the expression stage affect the production of some eukaryotic enzymes in E. coli.FindingsA high yield of active soluble proteins was obtained by combining early-log phase cultures and low temperatures for protein induction. When IPTG was added at OD600\u2009=\u20090.1 and cultures were maintained at 4\u00b0C for 48-72\u00a0h, the soluble protein yield was 3 fold higher than that obtained in the mid-log phase (OD600\u2009=\u20090.6). Besides, the target protein expression increased and the endogenous bacterial proteins reduced, thus making the protein purification process easier and more efficient.ConclusionsThe protocol can be widely applied to proteins with a heterologous expression which was limited by loss of activity at high temperatures or by low soluble recombinant protein yield.",

Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within producing bacteria. The production of soluble proteins under native conditions is essential for functional and structural analyses.

San-Miguel, P. P\u00e9rez-Berm\u00fadez, I. Gavidia\n## Abstract\nBackgroundProducing recombinant plant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli produce in high yields and in a soluble and functional form can be difficult. Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within the producing bacteria. We evaluated how the initial culture density, temperature and duration of the expression stage affect the production of some eukaryotic enzymes in E. coli.FindingsA high yield of active soluble proteins was obtained by combining early-log phase cultures and low temperatures for protein induction. When IPTG was added at OD600\u2009=\u20090.1 and cultures were maintained at 4\u00b0C for 48-72\u00a0h, the soluble protein yield was 3 fold higher than that obtained in the mid-log phase (OD600\u2009=\u20090.6). Besides, the target protein expression increased and the endogenous bacterial proteins reduced, thus making the protein purification process easier and more efficient.ConclusionsThe protocol can be widely applied to proteins with a heterologous expression which was limited by loss of activity at high temperatures or by low soluble recombinant protein yield.\n## Background\nOne important limitation for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli is obtaining large amounts of soluble and functional proteins. Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within producing bacteria. The production of soluble proteins under native conditions is essential for functional and structural analyses. Therefore, many studies have focused on optimising processes in protein expression (see Peti and Page 2007). One possibility is the solubilisation of proteins from inclusion bodies, but it usually requires denaturing conditions, and the subsequent renaturing step can prove difficult. Several experimental approaches have been developed to prevent these aggregates from forming, which include the use of cold inducible expression systems (Qing et al. 2004, Thuy Le andSchumann 2007), to increase the intracellular concentration of molecular chaperones (Mogk et al. 2002), to reduce the IPTG concentration for induction (Winograd et al. 1993), to induce the expression in a late log phase culture (Galloway et al. 2003), and to lower the growth temperature of induced cultures (Schein andNoteborn 1988, Vera et al. 2007).\n\nIn previous works, we reported the isolation and biochemical characterisation of genes P5\u03b2R (Gavidia et al. 2007) and P5\u03b2R2 (P\u00e9rez-Berm\u00fadez et al. 2010), which encode progesterone 5\u03b2-reductase (P5\u03b2R).

In the case of both rGALNSopt and rGALNSoptGly, the highest specific activities in the intra and extracellular fractions were obtained with 0.1 mM of IPTG and 37 \u2022 C (Fig. 2A-D), and only low enzyme activities were observed in the inclusion bodies fraction derived from cultures expressing rGALNSopt (Fig. 2E).It should be noted that rGALNSoptGly activity levels were lower than rGALNSopt regardless of the culture conditions, which was likely due to differences in the E. coli strains used for the production of each protein (i.e., MC4100 gmdkan \u0394waaL and BL21(DE3), respectively).",

In the case of both rGALNSopt and rGALNSoptGly, the highest specific activities in the intra and extracellular fractions were obtained with 0.1 mM of IPTG and 37 \u2022 C (Fig. 2A-D), and only low enzyme activities were observed in the inclusion bodies fraction derived from cultures expressing rGALNSopt (Fig. 2E).It should be noted that rGALNSoptGly activity levels were lower than rGALNSopt regardless of the culture conditions, which was likely due to differences in the E. coli strains used for the production of each protein (i.e., MC4100 gmdkan \u0394waaL and BL21(DE3), respectively).",

COLI, ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED GENE EXPRESSION SYSTEMS\nFor example, a commonly used method is the addition of solubility-enhancing fusion tags to the protein of interest. 23 Often, slowing down the rate of gene expression by using low-copy plasmids and/or low induction temperatures improves solubility as well. Alternatively, co-expression of molecular chaperones can result in proper folding in E. coli. 24 Auto-induction media 20 may also improve yields of soluble protein in E. coli. \n\nAnother option is the engineering of protein sequences to increase their solubility in E. coli, for which easy-to-use and validated open-access algorithms are available. 25 In some cases, aggregation of the recombinantly produced proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies can also be exploited to purify relatively homogeneous target proteins and refold them. 26 However, it must be stressed that the refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies 27 requires time-consuming protocol optimization, and the yields are often low and the recovery of the native structure must be carefully verified. \n\nMany useful general papers [28][29][30][31][32] and protocols to start approaching protein production in E. coli are available.",

Wrong selection of chaperones will negatively affect the host cells physiology and the production of heterologous proteins. Due to this reason, type and combination of chaperone molecules are crucial to produce more soluble and active form of target protein. In the current study, the cooverproduction of five different combinations of 6 chaperones, comprising \"DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/GroES/ GroEL\", \"GroES/GroEL\", \"DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE\", \"GroES/GroEL/TF\" and \"TF\" along with recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (rhbFGF) were studied. As a result, we proved that none of these combinations was able to completely prevent the formation of inclusion bodies, but co-overexpression of the bacterial chaperone system TF along with rhbFGF could significantly enhance the yield of soluble protein. Recombinant soluble hbFGF that co-expressed with TF was then purified from the cells and was found to be identical to the active rhbFGF expressed alone with respect to size and spectral properties.",

The aggregated proteins lose their correct conformations and are deposited to inclusion bodies known to be in the inactive form of the protein (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). \n\nAlthough inclusion body formation can greatly simplify and Sambrook, 1992). During over-expression of proteins in Escherichia coli, the bacterial chaperones might get titrated out and thus fail to meet the demand of an overload of nascent polypeptides (Schweder et al., 2002). \n\nIn this regard, increasing the chaperone supply seems a noticeable solution to the problems arising from formation of inclusion bodies during over-production of recombinant proteins (Schlieker et al., 2002). Goloubinoff et al. (1989) first demonstrated that chaperone co-overexpression is a powerful tool to improving the folding of heterologous proteins by showing that the yield of active Aspergillus nidulanse RUBISCO was increased 10-folds in the cells harboring groELS operon. Subsequently, lots of attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded and soluble recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of chaperones combination in producing cells. \n\nIt is still a trial and error process to find a compatible chaperone system to increase the solubility of the target protein. For instance, GroELS or DnaKJ were effective for some proteins such as RUBISCO, human procollagenase, E. coli glutamate racemase but along with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, yeast N-myristoyl transferase and \u03b2-galactosidase-bovine somatotropin fusion protein both chaperone systems demonstrate the lack of effect (Goloubinoff et al., 1989;Lee and Olins, 1992;Ferreyra et al., 1993).

Sardari\n## Abstract\nManipulating the cytoplasmic folding environment by increasing the intracellular concentration of folding modulators, such as chaperone molecules, causes the convenient production of heterologous proteins. Wrong selection of chaperones will negatively affect the host cells physiology and the production of heterologous proteins. Due to this reason, type and combination of chaperone molecules are crucial to produce more soluble and active form of target protein. In the current study, the cooverproduction of five different combinations of 6 chaperones, comprising \"DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/GroES/ GroEL\", \"GroES/GroEL\", \"DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE\", \"GroES/GroEL/TF\" and \"TF\" along with recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (rhbFGF) were studied. As a result, we proved that none of these combinations was able to completely prevent the formation of inclusion bodies, but co-overexpression of the bacterial chaperone system TF along with rhbFGF could significantly enhance the yield of soluble protein. Recombinant soluble hbFGF that co-expressed with TF was then purified from the cells and was found to be identical to the active rhbFGF expressed alone with respect to size and spectral properties.\n## INTRODUCTION\nOver-expression of heterologous proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli is often accompanied by their accumulation into insoluble aggregates. The aggregated proteins lose their correct conformations and are deposited to inclusion bodies known to be in the inactive form of the protein (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). \n\nAlthough inclusion body formation can greatly simplify and Sambrook, 1992). During over-expression of proteins in Escherichia coli, the bacterial chaperones might get titrated out and thus fail to meet the demand of an overload of nascent polypeptides (Schweder et al., 2002). \n\nIn this regard, increasing the chaperone supply seems a noticeable solution to the problems arising from formation of inclusion bodies during over-production of recombinant proteins (Schlieker et al., 2002). Goloubinoff et al. (1989) first demonstrated that chaperone co-overexpression is a powerful tool to improving the folding of heterologous proteins by showing that the yield of active Aspergillus nidulanse RUBISCO was increased 10-folds in the cells harboring groELS operon. Subsequently, lots of attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded and soluble recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of chaperones combination in producing cells. \n\nIt is still a trial and error process to find a compatible chaperone system to increase the solubility of the target protein. For instance, GroELS or DnaKJ were effective for some proteins such as RUBISCO, human procollagenase, E. coli glutamate racemase but along with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, yeast N-myristoyl transferase and \u03b2-galactosidase-bovine somatotropin fusion protein both chaperone systems demonstrate the lack of effect (Goloubinoff et al., 1989;Lee and Olins, 1992;Ferreyra et al., 1993). Nishahara et al. (2000) reported the effect of chaperone combinations on the three different aggregation prone proteins.",

Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.",

Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.",

            "abstract": "Background: Overexpression of EGFR is associated with carcinogenesis in more than 70% of head and neck cancers. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR and block the EGFR downstream signaling pathway, which results in the suppression of the growth of the tumor cells. Escherichia coli is the preferred system for expressing various recombinant proteins, including single chain antibodies, but the formation of inclusion bodies negatively affects the efficacy of this system. Several strategies have been suggested to solve this problem, notably the utilization of molecular chaperones. Objectives: In this study, we attempted to increase the soluble expression of huscfv antibody via co-expression with the cytoplasmic chaperones. Materials and Methods: To achieve this purpose, chaperones plasmids pG-KJE8, pGro7, pKjE7, pTf16 and pG-Tf2 encoding cytoplasmic chaperones were co-expressed with the humanized anti-EGFR scFv construct in E. coli. Different temperatures, incubations times, and concentrations of IPTG were used to produce an active antibody with the highest solubility. Results were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Soluble huscFv was purified by Ni-NTA column and the biologic activity of the recombinant protein was determined by ELISA. Result: The results indicated that the highest concentrations of humanized anti-EGFR scFv were obtained by co-expression of huscFv via chaperone plasmid pG-KJE8 with 0.2 mM concentration of inducer (IPTG), culture temperature of 25 \u00b0C, and 4 h incubation time after induction. Conclusion: In conclusion, co-expression with chaperones could be used as an efficient strategy to produce soluble active ScFvs in E. coli.",

                    "text": "Single-chain antibodies have several advantages and are considered a promising treatment in cancer targeted therapy (23,24). The E. coli expression system is the most commonly used system to produce recombinant proteins. In spite of economical and biological benefits of E. coli expression system, it suffers from several noticeable shortcomings (15). One of its most serious limitations is the aggregation of misfolded recombinant proteins which leads to the formation of IBs (17,25). Insoluble IBs are serious obstacles in producing biologically active recombinant proteins. Various approaches have been used to overcome these restrictions, including applying various molecular chaperones (26) and expression in the periplasmic space (27). In addition, reducing the inducer concentrations and the culture temperature decrease the speed and the level of expression, providing adequate time for proteins to fold correctly (28), (29). \n\nThe periplasmic expression has several benefits compared to the cytoplasmic expression as the more appropriate formation of disulfide bonds, the small number of proteases and the presence of fewer proteins in the periplasmic space lead to higher quality proteins (30,31). Targeting recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space by using signal sequences (e.g., PelB, ompA, PhoA \u2026) in a Sec-dependent system poses some difficulties, such as protein aggregation in the cytoplasm. Using low temperature and co-expression with secretion chaperones (e.g., DnaK/ DnaJ and GroEL-GroES) could overcome this obstacle (32). In this study, we applied various strategies to produce active huscFv in the E. coli expression system. Coexpression of different chaperone plasmids with huscFv under low temperature and low inducer concentration noticeably enhanced (up to 54%) the solubility of the recombinant scFv. Co-expressing pG-KJE8 chaperone plasmid carrying dnaK-dnaJ-grpE-groES-groEL cytoplasmic chaperone with huscFv resulted in highest solubility.",

Farajnia, Seber Zahri, Nazanin Bagherlou, A. Tanoumand, L. Rahbarnia\n## Abstract\nBackground: Overexpression of EGFR is associated with carcinogenesis in more than 70% of head and neck cancers. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR and block the EGFR downstream signaling pathway, which results in the suppression of the growth of the tumor cells. Escherichia coli is the preferred system for expressing various recombinant proteins, including single chain antibodies, but the formation of inclusion bodies negatively affects the efficacy of this system. Several strategies have been suggested to solve this problem, notably the utilization of molecular chaperones. Objectives: In this study, we attempted to increase the soluble expression of huscfv antibody via co-expression with the cytoplasmic chaperones. Materials and Methods: To achieve this purpose, chaperones plasmids pG-KJE8, pGro7, pKjE7, pTf16 and pG-Tf2 encoding cytoplasmic chaperones were co-expressed with the humanized anti-EGFR scFv construct in E. coli. Different temperatures, incubations times, and concentrations of IPTG were used to produce an active antibody with the highest solubility. Results were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Soluble huscFv was purified by Ni-NTA column and the biologic activity of the recombinant protein was determined by ELISA. Result: The results indicated that the highest concentrations of humanized anti-EGFR scFv were obtained by co-expression of huscFv via chaperone plasmid pG-KJE8 with 0.2 mM concentration of inducer (IPTG), culture temperature of 25 \u00b0C, and 4 h incubation time after induction. Conclusion: In conclusion, co-expression with chaperones could be used as an efficient strategy to produce soluble active ScFvs in E. coli.\n## Discussion\nSingle-chain antibodies have several advantages and are considered a promising treatment in cancer targeted therapy (23,24). The E. coli expression system is the most commonly used system to produce recombinant proteins. In spite of economical and biological benefits of E. coli expression system, it suffers from several noticeable shortcomings (15). One of its most serious limitations is the aggregation of misfolded recombinant proteins which leads to the formation of IBs (17,25). Insoluble IBs are serious obstacles in producing biologically active recombinant proteins. Various approaches have been used to overcome these restrictions, including applying various molecular chaperones (26) and expression in the periplasmic space (27). In addition, reducing the inducer concentrations and the culture temperature decrease the speed and the level of expression, providing adequate time for proteins to fold correctly (28), (29). \n\nThe periplasmic expression has several benefits compared to the cytoplasmic expression as the more appropriate formation of disulfide bonds, the small number of proteases and the presence of fewer proteins in the periplasmic space lead to higher quality proteins (30,31). Targeting recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space by using signal sequences (e.g., PelB, ompA, PhoA \u2026) in a Sec-dependent system poses some difficulties, such as protein aggregation in the cytoplasm. Using low temperature and co-expression with secretion chaperones (e.g., DnaK/ DnaJ and GroEL-GroES) could overcome this obstacle (32). In this study, we applied various strategies to produce active huscFv in the E. coli expression system. Coexpression of different chaperone plasmids with huscFv under low temperature and low inducer concentration noticeably enhanced (up to 54%) the solubility of the recombinant scFv. Co-expressing pG-KJE8 chaperone plasmid carrying dnaK-dnaJ-grpE-groES-groEL cytoplasmic chaperone with huscFv resulted in highest solubility.",

Evidence had been presented that the majority of the expressed recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) formed aggregates (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) leading to inclusion body formation in the reducing environment of the E. coli cytosol [17,18]. Recovery of functional protein from inclusion bodies in vitro is a difficult, time-consuming, laborious and expensive task for such a multidomain and disulfide bond rich protein. Because of such limitations, E. coli as a host system was neglected for rHSA production. Therefore, designing advanced strategies to obtain protein in soluble form in vivo could bypass the tedious in vitro refolding strategies. \n\nAfter considering the advantages of E. coli as a host, the present work has targeted E. coli as an alternate host system for rHSA production through resolving the major issue of inclusion body formation associated with it. \n\nIn the present communication, we have demonstrated the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of HSA. Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction and cell lysis conditions etc., play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form have been optimized. We have studied the effect of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. We have also examined different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in the presence and absence of exogenous molecular chaperones-GroEL-ES and trigger factor (TF). \n\nHere, we are reporting the development of a simple, novel and innovative method for enhanced soluble and functional production of rHSA in E. coli. It has been achieved through modulation of basic yet very crucial parameters like the cellular growth, protein folding, and environmental parameters.",

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that is functional in the survival, maintenance and differentiation of nervous system cells. This protein has three subunits, of which the beta subunit has the main activity. Its structure consists of a cysteine knot motif made up of beta strands linked by disulfide bonds. It can be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of many diseases. As NGF extracted from natural sources is unsuitable for therapeutic goals, many studies have attempted to produce recombinant \u03b2-NGF. In this study, Trigger Factor (TF) chaperone was expressed simultaneously with \u03b2-NGF in E. coli in order to obtain increased yield of soluble recombinant human \u03b2-NGF. For this purpose, pET39b (+)::\u03b2-NGF and chaperone plasmid pTf16 were transferred to E.coli (DE3 strain). After the induction of each promoter, the total proteins and periplasmic proteins were extracted. To confirm the effects of TF on total protein and soluble \u03b2-NGF expression level, Bradford and Dot blot techniques and ImageJ software were used. Then, \u03b2-NGF was purified using affinity chromatography column (Ni +2 -NTA). Also, the PC12 cells were treated with the protein for one week in order to study the function of purified NGF. Our data indicated that co-expression of TF could increase the soluble and periplasmic production of \u03b2-NGF but not total proteins. Also, the treatment of PC12 cell line with purified \u03b2-NGF, co-expressed with TF chaperone, showed differentiation of these cells to nerve cells. This indicated that the purified NGF is fully functional. Our data suggest that the co-expression of cytoplasmic chaperone (TF) with recombinant nerve growth factor might be an efficient approach to produce a proper quantity of soluble and active rhNGF.\n## 2-Cell culture\nAfter protein concentration determination 50 ng/ml of purified \u03b2-NGF was added to PC12 cell line.

At first, the plasmid harboring +36GFP-A2-E7 was transformed into E. coli Rosetta competent cells. Then, the recombinant protein fused to histidine tag was expressed and purified using affinity chromatography. Different conditions such as inducer dose, time and temperature of induction, pH and urea concentration were evaluated. Finally, the delivery of the recombinant protein was detected in HEK-293T cells using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur data showed that the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies at 37 \u00b0C and 3 h post-induction. The soluble protein was generated using 0.5\u202fmM IPTG and growth at 16 \u00b0C for 20 h, and purified by low concentrations of urea and 200 mM imidazole. The soluble fraction of +36GFP-A2-E7 protein could significantly represent higher fluorescent property and stronger delivery into mammalian cells compared to the insoluble form.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGenerally, soluble form of fusion protein retained its biological activity and could directly penetrate into the cells without the fusion tags (Tab. 1, Fig. 7, Ref. 23).",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is still one of the most commonly convenient production systems because of low cost, effi ciency, suitability for large-scale cultivation and easy manipulation (1). However, over-expression of the recombinant non-bacterial proteins in E. coli (higher than 2 % of cellular protein) led to misfolding or incomplete folding processes. These structures could be accumulated as insoluble aggregates found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli as so-called inclusion bodies (1)(2)(3). Although, the expression of protein as inclusion bodies has a high yield, the procedures for separation, washing and solubilization of inclusion bodies and native form of the recombinant heterologous protein are often time-consuming and diffi cult (4,5). The recent studies showed that a large part of proteins in inclusion bodies is functional and thus can be used for multiple applications without being solubilized and refolded (6). However, several strategies are available to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies such as manipulation of growth temperature, medium composition, dose of inducer, induction time, and plasmid-related properties including promoter, copy number and host strain. For some pro-teins, these strategies were ineffective to get a soluble product (7,8). As known, the green fl uorescent protein (GFP) could be used to generate fl uorescent fusion proteins. Most GFP fusion proteins were constructed by placing GFP at either N-or C-terminus of the host protein. These structures could damage the function of some host proteins. Another approach was tested to insert GFP into the middle of the host protein. However, fi nding a suitable site for insertion of GFP was problematic and time-consuming (9). Thus, the production of some GFP fusion proteins was often performed in eukaryotic expression systems such as insect or yeast (10,11). In this study, we attempted to generate a biologically active fl uorescent fusion protein in an E. coli system.",

Motevalli, A. Khodaei, M. Anvari, A. Bolhassani\n## Abstract\nBACKGROUND\nProtein fusion technology was widely used to improve expression, purification and solubility of the recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli for in vitro/in vivo delivery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe developed a method for successful expression of soluble +36GFP-A2-E7 protein in E. coli and its effective delivery into mammalian cells. At first, the plasmid harboring +36GFP-A2-E7 was transformed into E. coli Rosetta competent cells. Then, the recombinant protein fused to histidine tag was expressed and purified using affinity chromatography. Different conditions such as inducer dose, time and temperature of induction, pH and urea concentration were evaluated. Finally, the delivery of the recombinant protein was detected in HEK-293T cells using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur data showed that the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies at 37 \u00b0C and 3 h post-induction. The soluble protein was generated using 0.5\u202fmM IPTG and growth at 16 \u00b0C for 20 h, and purified by low concentrations of urea and 200 mM imidazole. The soluble fraction of +36GFP-A2-E7 protein could significantly represent higher fluorescent property and stronger delivery into mammalian cells compared to the insoluble form.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGenerally, soluble form of fusion protein retained its biological activity and could directly penetrate into the cells without the fusion tags (Tab. 1, Fig. 7, Ref. 23).\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli (E. coli) is still one of the most commonly convenient production systems because of low cost, effi ciency, suitability for large-scale cultivation and easy manipulation (1). However, over-expression of the recombinant non-bacterial proteins in E. coli (higher than 2 % of cellular protein) led to misfolding or incomplete folding processes. These structures could be accumulated as insoluble aggregates found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli as so-called inclusion bodies (1)(2)(3). Although, the expression of protein as inclusion bodies has a high yield, the procedures for separation, washing and solubilization of inclusion bodies and native form of the recombinant heterologous protein are often time-consuming and diffi cult (4,5). The recent studies showed that a large part of proteins in inclusion bodies is functional and thus can be used for multiple applications without being solubilized and refolded (6). However, several strategies are available to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies such as manipulation of growth temperature, medium composition, dose of inducer, induction time, and plasmid-related properties including promoter, copy number and host strain. For some pro-teins, these strategies were ineffective to get a soluble product (7,8). As known, the green fl uorescent protein (GFP) could be used to generate fl uorescent fusion proteins. Most GFP fusion proteins were constructed by placing GFP at either N-or C-terminus of the host protein. These structures could damage the function of some host proteins. Another approach was tested to insert GFP into the middle of the host protein. However, fi nding a suitable site for insertion of GFP was problematic and time-consuming (9). Thus, the production of some GFP fusion proteins was often performed in eukaryotic expression systems such as insect or yeast (10,11). In this study, we attempted to generate a biologically active fl uorescent fusion protein in an E. coli system.",

Conditions must be determined that lead to a minimal presence of aggregates (both soluble and insoluble) and maximal yield of the native target protein with the correct oligomeric conformation [17,18]. \n\nAlthough protein solubility during expression is an essential prerequisite before purification, this does not prevent aggregation problems from arising at later stages of the protein production process.

These include the screening of different bacterial strains, decreasing culture temperature, using modified culture media or different solubility-enhancing fusion proteins such as maltose-binding protein, alternative expression systems such as baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells, mammalian or cell-free expression, constructs with either amino-or carboxyl-terminal deletions, expressing homologs of the protein of interest, removing flexible loops or residues that affect solubility, and refolding of denatured proteins. \n\nThe quality of the overexpressed product must be evaluated by monitoring the ratio between monomeric and aggregated protein step-by-step in small-scale expression and purification tests coupled to SDS-PAGE and analytical gel filtration [22]. Conditions must be determined that lead to a minimal presence of aggregates (both soluble and insoluble) and maximal yield of the native target protein with the correct oligomeric conformation [17,18]. \n\nAlthough protein solubility during expression is an essential prerequisite before purification, this does not prevent aggregation problems from arising at later stages of the protein production process. In general, factors such as buffer composition, pH value, kosmotropes, or chaotropes should be screened (see Fig. 5).",

In this expression system, induction of heterologous protein is achieved by increasing the culture temperature, generally above 37\u00b0C. Concomitant to the overexpression of heterologous protein, the increase in temperature also causes a variety of complex stress responses. Many studies have reported the use of such temperature inducible expression system, however only few discuss the simultaneous stress effects caused by recombinant protein production and the up-shift in temperature. Understanding the integral effect of such responses should be useful to develop improved strategies for high yield protein production and recovery. Here, we describe the current status of the heat inducible expression system based on the pL and/or pR \u03bb phage promoters, focusing on recent developments on expression vehicles, the stress responses at the molecular and physiological level that occur after heat induction, and bioprocessing factors that affect protein overexpression, including culture operation variables and induction strategies.",

Absence of DnaK results in larger IB, whereas a deficiency of GroEL reduces aggregation and favors soluble protein formation, with the concomitant production of smaller and numerous IB [155]. This has been explained as a combined consequence of a less efficient folding and impaired rescue (removal) of aggregates [161]. \n\nInterestingly, expression systems that are not based on heat induction have exploited phenomena present in the heat inducible expression system to improve various aspects of recombinant protein production. For instance, chaperones like DnaK/J or DnaK/J-GrpE/ClpB have been co-expressed to facilitate disaggregation and refolding of the recombinant protein of interest [162,163]. Likewise, the co-expression of GroEL/S with heterologous proteins such as zeta-crystallin [164] and carbamoylase [165] has significantly enhanced the yield of soluble proteins. Other examples include the co-expression of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones to increase the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, or the overexpression of DnaJ to increase soluble transglutaminase content [166,167]. Overexpression of all such chaperons naturally occurs during thermoinduction of heterologous protein. Accordingly, the knowledge gained on the molecular and physiological events that occur during recombinant protein production by the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system can be of great value to control and improve not only this expression system but others as well.",

A. Valdez-Cruz, Luis Caspeta, N. P\u00e9rez, O. Ram\u00edrez, M. Trujillo-Rold\u00e1n\n## Abstract\nThe temperature inducible expression system, based on the pL and/or pR phage lambda promoters regulated by the thermolabile cI857 repressor has been widely use to produce recombinant proteins in prokariotic cells. In this expression system, induction of heterologous protein is achieved by increasing the culture temperature, generally above 37\u00b0C. Concomitant to the overexpression of heterologous protein, the increase in temperature also causes a variety of complex stress responses. Many studies have reported the use of such temperature inducible expression system, however only few discuss the simultaneous stress effects caused by recombinant protein production and the up-shift in temperature. Understanding the integral effect of such responses should be useful to develop improved strategies for high yield protein production and recovery. Here, we describe the current status of the heat inducible expression system based on the pL and/or pR \u03bb phage promoters, focusing on recent developments on expression vehicles, the stress responses at the molecular and physiological level that occur after heat induction, and bioprocessing factors that affect protein overexpression, including culture operation variables and induction strategies.\n## Protein accumulation and recovery\nInterestingly, the absence of DnaK and GroEL in E. coli mutants significantly reduces bacterial growth [161]. Absence of DnaK results in larger IB, whereas a deficiency of GroEL reduces aggregation and favors soluble protein formation, with the concomitant production of smaller and numerous IB [155]. This has been explained as a combined consequence of a less efficient folding and impaired rescue (removal) of aggregates [161]. \n\nInterestingly, expression systems that are not based on heat induction have exploited phenomena present in the heat inducible expression system to improve various aspects of recombinant protein production. For instance, chaperones like DnaK/J or DnaK/J-GrpE/ClpB have been co-expressed to facilitate disaggregation and refolding of the recombinant protein of interest [162,163]. Likewise, the co-expression of GroEL/S with heterologous proteins such as zeta-crystallin [164] and carbamoylase [165] has significantly enhanced the yield of soluble proteins. Other examples include the co-expression of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones to increase the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, or the overexpression of DnaJ to increase soluble transglutaminase content [166,167]. Overexpression of all such chaperons naturally occurs during thermoinduction of heterologous protein. Accordingly, the knowledge gained on the molecular and physiological events that occur during recombinant protein production by the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system can be of great value to control and improve not only this expression system but others as well.",

The generation of expression vectors regulated under cold conditions can improve the expression of some target proteins that are difficult to express in different expression systems. The cspA encodes the major cold-shock protein from Escherichia coli (CspA). The promoter of cspA has been widely used to develop cold shock-inducible expression platforms in E. coli. Moreover, it is often necessary to employ expression systems other than bacteria, particularly when recombinant proteins require complex post-translational modifications. Currently, there are no commercial platforms available for expressing target genes by cold shock in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, genetic elements that respond to cold shock offer the possibility of developing novel cold-inducible expression platforms, particularly suitable for yeasts, and mammalian cells. This review covers the importance of the cellular response to low temperatures and the prospective use of cold-sensitive promoters to direct the expression of recombinant proteins. This concept may contribute to renewing interest in applying white technologies to produce recombinant proteins that are difficult to express.",

Instead, they can quickly form aggregates under conventional expression conditions, that is, when chemically or nutritionally inducible promoters drive the expression at physiological temperatures. Recombinant proteins readily accumulate into so-called inclusion bodies, for this reason, alternative protocols have been developed to recover these proteins. To obtain a given amount of soluble protein, a common approach involves the production of larger amounts of the protein expressed as inclusion bodies. Additional processes to recover the later protein may include in vitro refolding, strain engineering to increase the concentration of molecular chaperones, or cell cultures at relatively low temperatures. Low-temperature protein expression in E. coli prevents the degradation of proteolytically sensitive products and restricts the overall protein synthesis [25,148], this may result in a higher yield of soluble protein versus aggregation-prone proteins or unstable products. However, cell growth may be notably affected under these conditions. Alternatively, bacterial expression systems with vectors directed by cold-inducible promoters may be grown at low temperatures for short periods only. This strategy often leads to overexpression of the target protein with the advantages cited above for cultures performed fully at low temperatures, i.e., with greater productivity of the target protein [25,149]. \n\nThe cspA cold shock promoter and its regulatory elements have been well suited to direct and optimize, in E. coli, the expression of recombinant proteins at low temperatures [150][151][152].

Marsch\n## Abstract\nLow-temperature expression of recombinant proteins may be advantageous to support their proper folding and preserve bioactivity. The generation of expression vectors regulated under cold conditions can improve the expression of some target proteins that are difficult to express in different expression systems. The cspA encodes the major cold-shock protein from Escherichia coli (CspA). The promoter of cspA has been widely used to develop cold shock-inducible expression platforms in E. coli. Moreover, it is often necessary to employ expression systems other than bacteria, particularly when recombinant proteins require complex post-translational modifications. Currently, there are no commercial platforms available for expressing target genes by cold shock in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, genetic elements that respond to cold shock offer the possibility of developing novel cold-inducible expression platforms, particularly suitable for yeasts, and mammalian cells. This review covers the importance of the cellular response to low temperatures and the prospective use of cold-sensitive promoters to direct the expression of recombinant proteins. This concept may contribute to renewing interest in applying white technologies to produce recombinant proteins that are difficult to express.\n## Cold shock-responsive promoters for protein expression in prokaryotes\nA major drawback of overexpressing recombinant proteins in E. coli is that they often do not readily fold into their native conformation.

The expression of the protein and the activity of the lac promoter is maximum at 37\u00b0C [23]. However, Optimization of temperature helps improve the nal yield, expression and solubility of the target protein. At higher temperature, the target protein is more prone to proteolytic degradation and denaturation by heat, and thus the protein accumulates as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Lowering the temperature from 37\u00b0C to about 25\u00b0C has seen to reduce the proteolytic degradation of the protein and improve the stability of the target protein [24]. Lowering the culture temperature is also seen to enhance the proper export and folding of functional recombinant proteins [25]. As seen in the case of lower concentration of IPTG induction, lower temperature helps in the proper formation of recombinant proteins by reducing their overexpression which ultimately leads the protein to the folding pathways and hence protein aggregation does not occur [26].",

These optimization conditions depend on the promoter under which the gene of interest is present and the characteristics of the target protein.ConclusionIn the past few years, many optimization conditions for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli have been studied. These conditions depend mainly upon the promoter used to produce protein and the type of protein produced. Optimizing the expression parameters of protein produced in Escherichia coli ensures maximum yield of the desired protein.\n## The effect of temperature\nThe temperature has a signi cant effect on the expression of the target protein in the prokaryotic expression system. The expression of the protein and the activity of the lac promoter is maximum at 37\u00b0C [23]. However, Optimization of temperature helps improve the nal yield, expression and solubility of the target protein. At higher temperature, the target protein is more prone to proteolytic degradation and denaturation by heat, and thus the protein accumulates as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Lowering the temperature from 37\u00b0C to about 25\u00b0C has seen to reduce the proteolytic degradation of the protein and improve the stability of the target protein [24]. Lowering the culture temperature is also seen to enhance the proper export and folding of functional recombinant proteins [25]. As seen in the case of lower concentration of IPTG induction, lower temperature helps in the proper formation of recombinant proteins by reducing their overexpression which ultimately leads the protein to the folding pathways and hence protein aggregation does not occur [26].",

Hence, to optimize a large-scale recombinant protein production process, it is essential to know what proportion of the protein forms precipitates and what fraction remains in soluble form, and therefore functional for most subsequent applications. In order to know the percentage of soluble and insoluble YFP protein, batch cultures were carried out with E. coli growing under the conditions corresponding to the maximum expression observed for each vector (Figure 5).

Production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bond for therapeutic, diagnostic and various other purposes is a challenging task of research. Production of such proteins in the reducing cytosolic compartment of E. coli usually ends up in inclusion bodies formation. Refolding of inclusion bodies can be difficult, time and labor consuming and uneconomical. Translocation of these proteins into the oxidative periplasmic compartment provides correct environment to undergo proper disulfide bonds formation and thus achieving native conformation. However, not all proteins can be efficiently translocated to the periplasm with the help of bacterial signal peptides. Therefore, fusion to a small well-folded and stable periplasmic protein is more promising for periplasmic production of disulfide bonded proteins. In the past decades, several full-length proteins or domains were used for enhancing translocation and solubility. Here, protein fusion tags that significantly increase the yields of target proteins in the periplasmic space are reviewed.",

Formation of correct disulfide bonds are must for achieving native conformation, solubility and activity. Production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bond for therapeutic, diagnostic and various other purposes is a challenging task of research. Production of such proteins in the reducing cytosolic compartment of E. coli usually ends up in inclusion bodies formation. Refolding of inclusion bodies can be difficult, time and labor consuming and uneconomical. Translocation of these proteins into the oxidative periplasmic compartment provides correct environment to undergo proper disulfide bonds formation and thus achieving native conformation. However, not all proteins can be efficiently translocated to the periplasm with the help of bacterial signal peptides. Therefore, fusion to a small well-folded and stable periplasmic protein is more promising for periplasmic production of disulfide bonded proteins. In the past decades, several full-length proteins or domains were used for enhancing translocation and solubility. Here, protein fusion tags that significantly increase the yields of target proteins in the periplasmic space are reviewed.\n",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1]. However, it is a common problem for recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and/or periplasm upon gene over-expression in E. coli [2,3]. This complex phenomenon has many contributing factors: insolubility of the product at the concentrations being produced, inability to fold correctly in the bacterial environment, or lack of appropriate bacterial chaperone proteins [4,5]. Several strategies are commonly employed to reduce inclusion bodies: a) controlling the rate of protein synthesis, b) enabling secretion into the periplasm, and c) co-expression of chaperone genes. The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [6]. The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing [1,5,7,8,9,10], although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm [11,12]. The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins [13,14,15,16]. Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins [17,18,19]. Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

            "text": "The bacterium Escherichia coli is a major host for recombinant protein production of non-glycosylated products. Depending on the expression strategy, the recombinant protein can be located intracellularly, which often leads to protein aggregates inside of the cytoplasm, forming so the called inclusion bodies (IBs). When compared to other protein expression strategies, inclusion body formation allows high product titers and also the possibility of expressing proteins being toxic for the host. In the past years, the comprehension of inclusion bodies being only inactive protein aggregates changed, and the new term of non-classical inclusion bodies emerged. These inclusion bodies are believed to contain a reasonable amount of active protein within their structure. However, subsequent downstream processing, such as homogenisation of cells, centrifugation or solubilisation of IBs, is prone to variable process performance and is often known to result in low extraction yields. It is hypothesised that variations in IB quality attributes are responsible for those effects and that such attributes can be controlled by upstream process conditions. In this review, we address the impact of process design (process parameters) in the upstream on defined inclusion body quality attributes. The following topics are therefore addressed: (i) an overview of the range of inclusion body applications (including emerging technologies); (ii) analytical methods to determine quality attributes; and (iii) screws in process engineering to achieve the desired quality attributes for different inclusion body\u2013based applications. Process parameters in the upstream can be used to trigger different quality attributes including protein activity, but are not exploited to a satisfying content yet. Design by quality approaches in the upstream are already considered for a multitude of existing processes. Further intensifying this approach may pave the industrial application for new IB-based products and improves IB processing, as discussed within this review.",

            "text": "Among the available expression hosts, E. coli remains the most attractive one for production of heterologous proteins for a variety of downstream utilization. Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [12]. However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins [6,9]. Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein [13]. So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins [14]. Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host. Varying several parameters such as fusion partners, post induction temperature, promoters, or E. coli strains have been reported to be able to alleviate the insolubility problem and increase the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [15].",

            "text": "The expression of recombinant proteins is important for the study of the biological functions of genes, the development of therapeutic drugs [1], and for industrial processes [2].There are several protein expression systems to produce the target proteins, such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems.Expression in mammalian cells and insect cells produces biologically active proteins that contain post-translational modification(s), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation.However, expression using these systems gives low yields of the recombinant proteins, and the cost of these systems is generally expensive for industrial-scale protein production.Cell-free systems also give low yields of the recombinant proteins.Among the cell-free systems, the Escherichia coli (E.coli) overexpression system is the most convenient and frequently used to produce recombinant proteins [1,3].\n\nRecombinant proteins often require the assistance of folding modulators, such as chaperone proteins, during expression in E. coli.In the overexpression system, the rate of protein aggregation is often much greater than that of proper folding and chaperone proteins are rapidly used up [4].These protein aggregates are called inclusion bodies.As the target proteins are usually purified from soluble fractions in bacteria cell lysates, the formation of inclusion bodies is often a drawback in the use of E. coli expression systems [2].Changing the growth conditions, such as growth temperature, concentration of inducer, and induction time, can often help in decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies (insoluble fraction of the proteins).Recently, it has been reported that recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the soluble form in the expression system by adding compatible solutes (chemical additives) in the expression medium [5].Instead of forming inclusion bodies, the target protein could be expressed as a soluble protein in the presence of sorbitol, arginine, and trehalose in the expression medium [5].It is expected that appropriate additives can suppress the formation of inclusion bodies and, thus, increase the solubility of target proteins in E. coli overexpression systems.",

            "text": "In fed-batch cultivations, the development of inclusion bodies may be observed by tracking shifts in intrinsic light dispersion via cytometric flow [143]. This enables the growth conditions to be controlled in real time as soon as inclusion bodies are observed even at low rates, and the formation of such bodies may be prevented theoretically [144]. Protein folding involves the presence of a particular cofactor. The addition of such cofactors or binding partners to the culture media may significantly increase the yield of the soluble protein. This phenomenon was demonstrated with a recombinant hemoglobin mutant, resulting in an increased aggregation of the soluble substance upon excessive addition of heme factor [145]. Similarly, a 50% improvement in the solubility of gloshedobin was observed when developed in the E. coli recombinant system with 0.1 mM Mg 2+ [146]. The medium structure and optimization are essential considerations for the soluble expression of recombinant proteins. While this is achieved primarily by trial and error, it can be useful, nonetheless. \n\nThe overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is commonly employed for manufacturing proteins in significant amounts owing to advantages, such as the development using cheap sources of energy, rapid deposition of biomass, suitability for fermentation with high cell density, and fairly quick output [14]. However, according to the data published by the Center for Eukaryotic Structure Genomics (CESG) (http:/targetdb.pdb.org/statistics/sites/CESG.html), only approximately 30% of the cloned targets in E. coli, among the total of 8048 targets, were presented in a soluble form, while the rest were presented either in a deteriorated form or as insoluble aggregates, classified as inclusion bodies [147]. While inclusion bodies cannot be used specifically for experiments involving protein activity, their insolubility offers a simple source of fairly pure protein, provided only certain proteins can be transformed to their natural and active conformation.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli recombinant protein production systems are designed to achieve a high accumulation of soluble protein product in the bacterial cell. However, a strong and rapid protein production can lead to stressful situations for the host cell, resulting in protein misfolding in vivo, and consequent aggregation into inclusion bodies (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b;Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010). For instance, macromolecular crowding of proteins at high concentrations in the E. coli cytoplasm often impairs the correct folding of proteins, leading to the formation of folding intermediates that, when inefficiently processed by molecular chaperones, promote inclusion body formation (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b).\n\nStrategies that direct the soluble production of proteins in E. coli are, thus, envisaged, and become more attractive than protein refolding procedures from inclusion bodies.\n\nSeveral methods have been shown to prevent or decrease protein aggregation during protein production in E. coli on a trial-and-error basis, including:\n\n(i) Lower expression temperatures: bacteria cultivation at reduced temperatures is often used to reduce protein aggregation, since it slows down the rate of protein synthesis and folding kinetics, decreasing the hydrophobic interactions that are involved in protein self-aggregation (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). Low cultivation temperatures can also reduce or impair protein degradation due to a poor activity of heat shock proteases that are usually induced during protein overproduction in E. coli (Chesshyre and Hipkiss, 1989). This strategy has, however, some drawbacks as the reduction of temperature can also affect replication, transcription, and translation rates, besides decreasing the bacterial growth and protein production yields. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by the use of coldinducible promoters that maximize protein production under low temperature conditions (Mujacic et al., 1999). (ii) E. coli-engineered host strains: E. coli mutant strains are a significant advance toward the soluble production of difficult recombinant proteins. Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Ma",

            "text": "Production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins. One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation [25][26][27]. The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies [10,26,28,29]. The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding [30]. Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins [31]. It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32].",

            "text": "This system produces large quantities of protein in a shorter period of time and at lower cost. However, the high yield of heterologous protein in E. coli often leads to improper protein folding, which results in insoluble and non-functional proteins that are aggregated in inclusion bodies [8,9]. Even though aggregation of recombinant protein in inclusion bodies provides an easy method for protein isolation and purification, refolding of the recombinant protein in vitro to gain biological activity often presents great challenges [10]. \n\nExtensive efforts have been made to promote the expression of soluble recombinant proteins in E. coli. One strategy is to reduce protein synthesis rate by lowering incubation temperature and inducing pressure [11]. Another widely adapted strategy to improve the solubility of recombinant proteins is to add a fusion tag such as glutathione-s-transferase (GST) [12,13], maltose binding protein (MBP) [14,15], NusA [16], thioredoxin (Trx) [12,17], or small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) [18,19] to the target protein. Fusion tags have been shown to improve protein solubility as well as protein expression level in the E. coli system. However, the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli is complicated and the mechanism for this formation is not yet clear. For example, when using E. coli as a protein expression system, some eukaryotic proteins are highly likely to aggregate, regardless of the type of fusion tag used to improve protein solubility. This aggregation can lead to cumbersome and challenging procedures for in-vitro refolding. When a protein produced in the prokaryotic system is highly insoluble, the only option to make it soluble is to use a low-yield eukaryotic expression system. However, the low-yield protein will make the downstream protein purification more difficult. \n\nSUMO is a ubiquitin-related protein and regulates the activity of a wide variety of cellular target proteins by covalent modification of the target protein's lysine residues [20].",

            "text": "Poor product quality is a common event in the biological synthesis of target proteins and a major cause for recombinant enzymes and pharmaceuticals to be excluded from the market [1]. Recombinant protein misfolding and the triggering of the consequent cell responses are both general events among microbial cell factories [2]. Although what protein quality means might be highly controversial [3][4][5], it is in general assumed that the soluble protein version, despite the potential occurrence of soluble aggregates [4,[6][7][8][9][10] and the presence of functional protein species in protein aggregates [4,[11][12][13][14][15], is the most desirable form of the final product of a protein production process. Traditionally, gaining solubility has been approached by tuningdown the production rate (e.g. by decreasing temperature), reducing recombinant gene dosage or the strength of the promoter, or supplying additional amounts of host chaperones, as they are seen as limiting during the overproduction of misfolding-prone protein species [16,17]. \n\nUnder the high substrate load context of recombinant cells, chaperones, main players in the quality control system, might be over-titrated and therefore their protein targets excluded from folding pathways leading to the native conformation, accumulating as refractile particles called inclusion bodies (IBs) [13,18]. Therefore, several individual chaperones or chaperone sets have been selected for overproduction along with the target recombinant protein. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), most of these approaches have involved the two main cytosolic chaperones, namely DnaK and GroEL, as well as some of their co-chaperones [6,19]. However, the fine examination of physiological responses to protein production in bacteria and other microorganisms [2,10,[20][21][22], has revealed that chaperone co-production, as a quality-addressed strategy, might eventually show undesirable side effects regarding protein yield and quality (Table 1).",

The data, presented in Figure 3B, revealed that lower numbers of targets were obtained from genes synthesized artificially (p = 0.04). Several studies have demonstrated that codon optimization for heterologous production in E. coli can potentially increase recombinant protein expression, especially in sequences of eukaryotic and archaeal origin [23][24][25][26]. However, other studies revealed that E. coli codon optimization may lead to overexpression of recombinant proteins, thus resulting in a higher tendency to generate insoluble inclusion bodies [27,28]. The formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant expression systems occurs as a result of an imbalance between in vivo protein folding and aggregation [29][30][31]. The data presented here revealed that although the number of obtained proteins was reduced when genes were obtained synthetically, a significant proportion of non-viable targets revealed high levels of expression in the form of inclusion bodies (data not shown). Therefore, we can conclude that E. coli codon optimization increased the levels of recombinant protein expression. However, for some proteins, higher levels of expression were beyond E. coli's capacity to provide proper folding and led to the accumulation of the recombinant proteins in the form of insoluble aggregates. These targets may require further testing of the expression conditions (different strains and simpler media, such as LB).",

            "text": "Since early recombinant DNA times, bacteria (especially E. coli) have been the most widely used microorganisms for recombinant protein production due to genetic simplicity, fast growth rate, high cell density production and availability of a spectrum of genetic systems, among others. For production processes being efficient, foreign genes are expressed from plasmids and under the control of inducible promoters, what results into non physiological and unusually high transcription rates. Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109,110]. The specificity in protein aggregation makes inclusion bodies highly pure in composition and therefore enriched in the recombinant protein itself. However, also truncated versions of the recombinant product, other plasmid-encoded proteins, but also defined host cell proteins can get entrapped within bacterial inclusion bodies [111][112][113][114][115][116]. Moreover, the presence of folding assistant proteins in inclusion bodies [117-119] confirm that specific interactions lead to entrappment of cellular proteins in these aggregates. The high purity of inclusion bodies makes them a convenient source of easily extractable protein that must be refolded in vitro by denaturing procedures, a fact that has been largely exploited for biotechnology purposes",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is generally the first choice of host for the production of proteins and chemicals, because of its fast growth rate, a well-established expression system, high production yield, and low manufacturing cost. In E. coli cytoplasm, however, recombinant proteins tend to interact with non-specific hydrophobic patches, leading to the formation of inclusion bodies (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). To enhance soluble expression of recombinant proteins, various strategies have been suggested: N-terminus and/or C-terminus truncation, co-expression of chaperones, and fusion protein technologies (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005). To date, Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST), E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), E. coli N-utilization substance A (NusA), and E. coli thioredoxin are commonly used as fusion partners to prevent inclusion body formation (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006). Although fusion partners provide a general protective effect against insoluble aggregation, some soluble fusions lack detectable activities (Sachdev and Chirgwin, 1999). These soluble aggregates are formed by agglomeration of misfolded proteins of interest, while precipitation is prevented by the presence of the soluble fusion partners (Nomine et al., 2001). Thus, an alternative fusion system should be developed to increase soluble expression levels and simultaneously block agglomeration formation between misfolded target proteins. \n\nAs model proteins, we chose two fucosyltransferases (FTs). FTs transfer the fucosyl residue of GDP-L-fucose to lactose, leading to the formation of fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Microbial production of HMOs has received great attention, as they show beneficial effects on human health, such as prevention of pathogenic infection, modulation of the immune system, and prebiotic effects (Bode, 2015).",

To improve the process in E. coli, the following measures have been used: (i) Use of multiple promoters to control expression; (ii) use of specific host strains; (iii) co-expression of chaperones and/or foldase; (iv) reduction of temperature; (v) secretion of proteins in the periplasmic space or medium; (vi) reduction of protein synthesis; (vii) shift of the growth medium; (viii) introduction of a fusion partner; (ix) release of a protein fragment; and (x) denaturation and refolding of the protein in vitro [45]. Rapid fermentation with a cell density of E. coli has resulted in dry cell contents ranging from 20 to 175 g/L [46]. The issue of acetate development and toxicity can be solved by exponentially feeding glucose in the media and maintaining the real rate of growth below which the development of acetate is obtained. Yields as high as 5.5 g/L of \u03b1-consensus interferon have been achieved in the broth [47]. Long-term development of the chemostat (219 generations below a dilution rate of 0.05 h \u22121 ) produced an E. coli mutant with an increased growth rate and biomass yields, shorter lag period, lower acetate production, and increased stress resistance [48]. This strain produced high yields of heterologous secreted proteins [49]. Heterologous proteins developed as inclusion bodies in E. coli are inert, composite, and insoluble and typically exhibit non-native intraand inter-molecular disulfide bonds and rare free cysteines [50]. Such bodies must be separated from the cell to derive the active protein along with the proteins solubilized by denaturants, and disulfide bonds must be extracted using reduction agents. Refolding is achieved by eliminating the denaturant and reducing agent, accompanied by the protein being renatured.

            "text": "Bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) are submicron proteinaceous particles (usually ranging from 50 to about 800 nm (Figure 1 A, B) observed in recombinant bacteria. IB formation has been regularly reported during the forced expression of cloned genes as an intrinsic, often unavoidable idiosyncrasy of the recombinant 'bacterial factory'. Under transmission electron microscopy IBs are visualized as electrodense (Figure 1 A, bottom), dark areas in the cytoplasm (or sporadically in the periplasm, for secretory proteins), as the result of the aggregation and deposition as insoluble clusters of significant fractions of recombinant protein. \n\nIn this context, IBs are considered as a major drawback for high yield production of soluble proteins, either for research or as marketable goods in the biotechnological or pharmaceutical industry [1]. In an attempt to minimize IB formation and thus shift production towards soluble protein versions, many strategies have been proposed, including genetic approaches (e.g., reduction of gene dosage or gene expression rates), physical methods (e.g., lowering the culture temperature), physiological methodologies (e.g., co-producing chaperones and folding modulators) and nutrient availability (e.g., carbon source limitation) [2,3]. The success in the application of these procedures is not predictable, since being variable and product-linked they have not led into a universally established protocol applicable to all IB-forming proteins. On the other hand, IBs are mechanically stable protein deposits. They can be easily isolated upon cell disruption by simple physical means and used as a relatively pure source of recombinant protein which can be transformed into the active soluble form by solubilisation and subsequent refolding. For example, the first recombinant protein approved by the FDA for human application was insulin, the two chains produced in separate E. coli strains as fusion proteins forming IBs. Still today, human insulin is produced using two major routes. One route involves the production of a precursor in form of IBs using E. coli as production host with subsequent solubilization and refolding [4].",

We demonstrate high-yield recovery of a native, high-molecular-weight RNA binding protein without the aid of fusion protein sequence. The principle factor that increased protein yield was the induction of protein expression in a late log phase culture, although reduced temperature during the induction and a low IPTG concentration also contributed to a higher yield.",

            "text": "The Gram-negative bacterium E. coli is the host of choice for producing a multitude of recombinant proteins relevant in the pharmaceutical industry. Generally, cultivation is easy, media are cheap, and a high product titer can be obtained. However, harsh induction procedures combined with the usage of IPTG (isopropyl \u03b2-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside) as an inducer are often believed to cause stress reactions, leading to intracellular protein aggregates, which are so known as so-called inclusion bodies (IBs). Downstream applications in bacterial processes cause the bottleneck in overall process performance, as bacteria lack many post-translational modifications, resulting in time and cost-intensive approaches. Especially purification of inclusion bodies is notoriously known for its long processing times and low yields. In this contribution, we present screening strategies for determination of inclusion body bead size in an E. coli-based bioprocess producing exclusively inclusion bodies. Size can be seen as a critical quality attribute (CQA), as changes in inclusion body behavior have a major effect on subsequent downstream processing. A model-based approach was used, aiming to trigger a distinct inclusion body size: Physiological feeding control, using qs,C as a critical process parameter, has a high impact on inclusion body size and could be modelled using a hyperbolic saturation mechanism calculated in form of a cumulated substrate uptake rate. Within this model, the sugar uptake rate of the cells, in the form of the cumulated sugar uptake-value, was simulated and considered being a key performance indicator for determination of the desired size. We want to highlight that the usage of the mentioned screening strategy in combination with a model-based approach will allow tuning of the process towards a certain inclusion body size using a qs based control only. Optimized inclusion body size at the time-point of harvest should stabilize downstream processing and, therefore, increase the overall time-space yield. Furthermore, production of distinct inclusion body size may be interesting for application as a biocatalyst and nanoparticulate material.",

Against the outdated belief that the production of IBs should be avoided during recombinant protein production, quite a number of recombinant products are currently produced as IBs, which are then processed to give correctly folded and soluble product. However, this processing is quite cumbersome comprising IB wash, IB solubilization and refolding. To date, IB processing often happens rather uncontrolled and relies on empiricism rather than sound process understanding. In this mini review we describe current efforts to introduce more monitoring and control in IB processes, focusing on the refolding step, and thus generate process understanding and knowledge.",

            "text": "In addition to the peculiarity of providing a natural oxidizing environment that promotes the formation of disulfide bonds, the secretion of recombinant proteins in the periplasmic space offers other potential advantages. For example, the translocation reduces the exposure of the recombinant protein to host cytoplasmic proteases, reducing the degradation. Additionally, recombinant proteins are produced with a true N-terminus, thus without an N-terminal methionine. For proteins expressed in the periplasm the downstream processing is also simplified because it contains only around 4% to 8% of the natural E. coli cellular proteins and the outer membrane can be stripped away applying an osmotic shock or mild heat treatments. In spite of the above-mentioned benefits, the production of recombinant proteins into the E. coli periplasmic compartment is limited by the periplasm size and by the secretion capacity of the cell. \n\nThe periplasmic compartment accounts for less than 20% of the total cell volume. Depending on the strain, on the signal peptide used for secretion and on the protein of interest, there is a threshold of the protein amount that can be exported into the periplasmic compartment. Above a certain optimal rate of translation, secretion rates can rapidly decrease. Indeed, when the expression is too high, the translocation is slowed down by poorly exported proteins or by defective signal peptides, thereby metastable precursors may accumulate in the cytoplasm promoting inclusion bodies formation that affects protein yields and cell viability [141,142]. This excess of precursors of secretory proteins in the cytoplasm induces the up-regulation of heat shock proteins, which is mediated by the sigma factor 32 (\u03c332) [141], promoting inclusion bodies formation, reducing protein yields and cell viability (increased cell toxicity). Furthermore, it is not surprising that an excessive E. coli stress response could generate increased demand for protein folding and induce an uncharacterized metabolic burden on the cells that leads to protein misfolding and aggregation also in the periplasm.",

            "text": "These examples demonstrate the ability to address codon usage issues by selecting suitable lineages without entirely replacing the gene codons planning.\n\nA problem with folding errors that is routinely described in the literature is the inclusion bodies occurrence due to misfolded recombinant proteins.Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143].The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144].As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies.Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains.For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145].The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources.This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids.The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148].Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149].These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31,40].",

The aggregation of insoluble polypeptide chains as inclusion bodies has seriously restricted the spectrum of proteins marketed by the biotechnology industry. Being widespreadly believed that inclusion body proteins are biologically inactive and therefore useless in bioprocesses, many aggregation-prone products have been disregarded for commercialisation. Protein solubility can be tailored by either process [2] or protein [3] engineering, although most efforts have been addressed to minimize inclusion body formation by co-production of folding modulators [4], or to refold purified inclusion body proteins by chemical denaturation followed by refolding procedures [5]. Both strategies need to be adapted to particular protein species and they render largely variable results regarding the final soluble protein yield.\n\nInterestingly, independent reports have noted enzymatic activity associated to inclusion bodies formed by recombinant enzymes [6][7][8], but the extent of these side-observations has been never quantified and its biological and biotechnological relevance remained unexplored. In this work, we have quantitatively explored the biological activity of inclusion body recombinant proteins and their potential use for bioprocesses in the aggregated form.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production is a leading methodological platform of biotechnology and biomedicine [1]. Protein misfolding, degradation, aggregation, inclusion body formation and low functional protein quality are among the main obstacles encountered when using conventional bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli [2][3][4] as cell factories, these events being specially distressing when proteins are intended for therapeutic uses [5,6].\n\nApart from shifting to a growing number of alternative hosts, what might eventually improve protein yield and quality, several strategies have been implemented to favour recombinant protein yield and quality in bacteria, specially addressed to enhance proteolytic stability and minimize aggregation [3,7]. As the activities of the cell's quality control were identified ( [8], and references therein), the co-production of chaperones along with the target protein was taken as a routine approach. Firstly individual chaperones, and later chaperone-cochaperone pairs or larger chaperone sets, supplied from additional plasmid vectors, have been assayed as folding modulators under different experimental setting ups and for a large catalogue of proteins [9]. Despite reports of 1 Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article relevant successes, a consensus about final doses and composition of the best chaperone catalogue has not been reached, as the positive effects of this strategy seem to be highly dependent, among other potential factors, on the specific recombinant protein. In addition, externally supplied chaperones might show side effects on the whole physiology of recombinant cells and eventually compromise the quality, solubility or yield of the target recombinant protein [10,11]. Such undesired effects might limit the success of this method, and their occurrence can account, at least partially, for the lack of consistency of chaperone co-production as a generic strategy.\n\nDnaK, a key negative regulator of the quality control system and the main cytosolic E. coli chaperone (acting together with its co-chaperone DnaJ) is a common component of the most successful chaper",

In the case of both rGALNSopt and rGALNSoptGly, the highest specific activities in the intra and extracellular fractions were obtained with 0.1 mM of IPTG and 37 \u2022 C (Fig. 2A-D), and only low enzyme activities were observed in the inclusion bodies fraction derived from cultures expressing rGALNSopt (Fig. 2E).It should be noted that rGALNSoptGly activity levels were lower than rGALNSopt regardless of the culture conditions, which was likely due to differences in the E. coli strains used for the production of each protein (i.e., MC4100 gmdkan \u0394waaL and BL21(DE3), respectively).",

            "text": "BackgroundProtein over-production in Escherichia coli often results in formation of inclusion bodies (IBs). Some recent reports have shown that the aggregation into IBs does not necessarily mean that the target protein is inactivated and that IBs may contain a high proportion of correctly folded protein. This proportion is variable depending on the protein itself, the genetic background of the producing cells and the expression temperature. In this paper we have evaluated the influence of other production process parameters on the quality of an inclusion bodies protein.ResultsThe present paper describes the recombinant production in Escherichia coli of the flavohemoglobin from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125. Flavohemoglobins are multidomain proteins requiring FAD and heme cofactors. The production was carried out in several different experimental setups differing in bioreactor geometry, oxygen supply and the presence of a nitrosating compound. In all production processes, the recombinant protein accumulates in IBs, from which it was solubilized in non-denaturing conditions. Comparing structural properties of the solubilized flavohemoglobins, i.e. deriving from the different process designs, our data demonstrated that the protein preparations differ significantly in the presence of cofactors (heme and FAD) and as far as their secondary and tertiary structure content is concerned.ConclusionsData reported in this paper demonstrate that other production process parameters, besides growth temperature, can influence the structure of a recombinant product that accumulates in IBs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported example in which the structural properties of a protein solubilized from inclusion bodies have been correlated to the production process design.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used as an integral host for production of recombinant proteins in biopharmaceutical industry; however, production of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been associated with serious challenges. One major part of challenges is related to the fact that the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli often leads to the formation of misfolded protein aggregates, called inclusion bodies (IBs), mainly because of differences in folding pathways and physicochemical conditions between expression and natural hosts [1]. Although recombinant protein production via inclusion body formation system looks attractive due to attributes such as relatively straightforward IB generation to high yields, good supply of soluble protein after applying a solubilization treatment and potential clear-cut purification of target protein to high purities, IB proteins mostly contain non-functional target proteins which need to be solubilized by denaturants (e.g., high concentrations of chaotropic agents including urea and guanidinium chloride) and then refolded to functional (bioactive) counterparts [2,3]. The solubilization of IBs protein by denaturation is a simple process; however, the successful recovery of correctly-folded bioactive proteins from completely-denatured IB proteins is often a difficult step. For instance, large-scale refolding of recombinant streptokinase (rSK) from IBs separated from E. coli cells and solubilized in 4 M urea has led to a final product with biological activity much lower than the natural protein (i.e., the protein obtained from betahemolytic streptococci) [3].\n\nDue to the inefficiency of the aforementioned route of production for most proteins prone to forming IBs, directing such proteins into the periplasmic space (the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membrane) of E. coli has been considered as a potent alternative route of production [4,5]. Nevertheless, recombinant protein expression in the periplasm has been also come across with serious problems, relevant to the stress on the bacterial cells during cultivation process in bioreactor.

Among other expression hosts, Escherichia coli remain the preferable choice due to its ability to reach high-cell density culture and providing high-protein yield. However, expression in E. coli is lacking in post-translational modification, which become a disadvantage to protein that has pivotal recognition based on posttranslational modification accessories such as glycosylation [3]. Furthermore, protein expression in E. coli tends to produce as inclusion bodies. Formation of inclusion bodies offers advantages in higher quantity of protein target and facilitates convenient isolation, yet it sacrifices the biological activity. Protein in inclusion bodies often found in misfolded form, therefore, refolding was required to rejuvenate its activity [2,[4][5][6][7]. \n\nProtein refolding from inclusion bodies oftenly encompasses addition denaturant and removal of detergent. Denaturants such as guanidinium chloride or urea were added in solubilization of inclusion bodies, which helps misfolded protein revert back to its linear form. Later, removal of detergent helps to induce protein refolding [8]. The most common conventional methods in protein refolding include dilution and refolding, yet these methods are inexpensive and simple to be applied. Other methods involve chromatographic system, enzymeassisted refolding, immobilization folding catalyst and artificial chaperones, and microfluidic chips were known to help in protein refolding [8][9][10]. However, the major drawback in protein refolding was formation of protein aggregates. Several strategies have been studied to reduce protein aggregates using chemical additives. Amino acids such as proline and arginine (Arg) show ability to inhibit aggregate formation, while polyol such as glycerol or glucose oftenly combined with aggregation inhibitor to stabilize proteins [11].

            "text": "Aggregate formation is a constant of recombinant protein production. In contrast to previous hypotheses, we know now that aggregated proteins can conserve a consistent biological activity. Consequently, it is meaningful to study the aggregation process in vivo and to understand how chemical-physical factors can tune their characteristics [40] to improve their biotechnological value. Two opposite approaches have been proposed to cope with recombinant protein aggregation: try to limit it or to force the process and accumulate useful (functional and non-toxic) aggregates. The reversible dynamic of the aggregation-disaggregation process has been forced to improve the yields of soluble recombinant proteins by stimulating the bacterial cells to dissolve their inclusion bodies in vivo [7,41]. As an alternative, aggregation has been exploited as a valuable means for accumulating functional recombinant protein in the inclusion bodies and simplifying its purification for biotechnological applications [42] ( Figure 3). From this perspective, the identification of genetic backgrounds favorable for the production of particularly dense inclusion bodies is justified by the interest in improving the protein processing, obtaining higher titers in fermentation and simplified purification steps due to the reduced volumes and faster sedimentation. Pandey et al. [43] induced the production of recombinant model proteins in a bacterial library of randomly obtained knock-out mutants and succeeded in isolating clones producing more/denser inclusion bodies by means of percoll density gradient centrifugation. Unluckily, the authors did not evaluate whether the protein packed into denser inclusion bodies had structural and functional characteristics comparable to the control material or have lost them, as it has been observed when lipase A was fused to the self-assembling peptide ELK16 to improve its precipitation [44].\n\nThe biological value of proteins trapped in the inclusion bodies can be related to their physical structure rather than to their functional features. For instance, controlling the fermentation parameters allowed for the obtaining of inclusion bodies with variable geometries. When used to treat surfaces, they facilitate the adhesion of eukaryotic cells and promote tissue culture and differentiation [45].",

            "text": "The gram-negative bacterium E. coli is widely used as host for the production of recombinant proteins, due to wellknown genetics, simple handling and inexpensive fast high-density cultivations [1,2]. Recombinant expressed proteins in E. coli can be directed to the cytoplasm, inner or outer membrane, periplasm or the growth medium.\n\nCytoplasmatic expression is desired because of high yields of soluble product [3], but recombinant protein may accumulate in inclusion bodies (IB). Although biologic activity must be restored by in vitro renaturation procedures [4], IB can be valuable for heterologous gene expression [5]. One strategy to prevent IB formation involves fusion of the gene of interest downstream of the small eukaryotic protein ubiquitin [6]. The ubiquitin moiety enhances fusion protein yield and increases solubility due to intrinsic chaperonin properties [7]. This fusion system also allows production of proteins and peptides with an authentic N-terminus by the use of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB), cleaving the amide bond at the C-terminus of ubiquitin [8]. As E. coli lacks the ubiquitin system, release of target products can be conducted by protease addition [9,10].\n\nProtein export out of the cytoplasm has several advantages compared to intracellular production, due to 1) better folding (especially if disulfide-bond formation is required), 2) simplified downstream processing, 3) higher stability, 4) and correct N-terminal processing [11,12]. Translocation of target proteins across the inner membrane requires a signal peptide. However, presence of a signal sequence alone does not ensure secretion into the periplasmic space [13,14]. Thus, a larger secretion moiety can be linked to the target gene. Recently, a secretion system was described, using the periplasmic protease inhibitor ecotin [15] as fusion partner for the production of native pepsinogen and proinsulin in E. coli [16,17].\n\nIn the present work we established a new expression system, combining periplasmic secretion and the ubi",

These aggregated proteins are in general misfolded and thus biologically inactive. This can be avoided in part by slowing down expression rate using low temperatures, indeed, the expression and activity of a number of E. coli chaperones is increased at 30 \u2022 C [54,55] hence increasing protein folding efficiency and reducing precipitation into inclusion bodies.

            "text": "Heterologous proteins that are overexpressed in microbial hosts such as E. coli often accumulate in insoluble clusters called inclusion bodies (IBs). The IBs preferentially localize at the poles of the bacteria, which is thought to be related to the accumulation of dense DNA central in the cells. The IBs vary in size from 0.1 to 1 \u00b5m and although their chemical composition may vary, they consist predominantly of the overexpressed recombinant protein (Ramon et al., 2014;de Marco et al., 2019). Traditionally, IB formation is linked to the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides and seen as an obstacle in production processes aimed at high yields of soluble, active protein species. To avoid aggregation several strategies have been explored including lowering of transcription and translation rates, reduction of the growth temperature and co-expression of chaperones that assist in proper folding (Kaur et al., 2018). Alternatively, IBs can be isolated, denatured and subjected to refolding conditions to regenerate the active protein (Yamaguchi and Miyazaki, 2014;Singh et al., 2015). \n\nRather than being regarded as an undesirable side effect of industrial protein production, the generation of IBs is now increasingly appreciated as a useful strategy to obtain recombinant protein. Proteins in IBs are largely resistant against degradation by host cell proteases and less likely to exert toxic effects in the expression host. In addition, owing to their high density, IBs are easy to isolate from cell lysates by differential centrifugation, providing robust and cost-efficient protocols to obtain large amounts of relatively pure protein (Swartz, 2001;Sahdev et al., 2008;Martinez-Alonso et al., 2009). Moreover, whereas IBs for long were considered to be amorphous aggregates of disordered protein, they actually display a structured \u03b2-sheet organization and can contain significant amounts of protein in a native conformation. This makes them interesting as a supply of nanostructured biomaterial with high mechanical stability, biological activity and slow protein release properties.",

            "text": "With increasing demand for pharmaceutical proteins nowadays, more and more people are devoted to development of efficient biomanufacturing processes for proteins. Escherichia coli (E. coli), as one of the most commonly used host bacteria to express recombinant proteins, has many advantages. For example, high cell density cultures are easily achieved (Lee, 1996), transformation with exogenous genes is fast (Pope and Kent, 1996), and its use as a cell factory is well-established (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). However, commercial production of recombinant proteins by E. coli has remained a challenge. One of the most important problems is that E. coli has a poor ability to secrete proteins, which causes formation of inclusion bodies, low production titers, and complicated downstream purification procedures (Kim et al., 2015). To improve protein secretion efficiency in E. coli, some common strategies have been developed, such as selection of efficient signal peptides like the signal sequences from OmpA (Sun et al., 2019) and PelB (Mohajeri et al., 2016) that usually target proteins to the secretion machinery efficiently. Modification of key transporter proteins or auxiliary proteins involved in transmembrane transport also has been applied to increase the efficiency of protein secretion (Low et al., 2010). In addition, fusion of some peptide tags or proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), also have proved to increase protein expression and extracellular secretion. Other strategies to improve protein secretion include fermentation process parameters control and medium optimization, such as addition of surfactants, osmolytes, metal ions, and glycine to the medium. \n\nRecombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), a potential therapeutic protein that has been widely used as a healing agent for various chronic wounds, was successfully produced extracellularly in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pectate lyase B (PelB) signal peptide (Sriwidodo et al., 2019).",

The major disadvantage of using E. coli host is the production of bodies [77]. \n\nInclusion bodies are insoluble protein aggregates that lack biological function [78]; their formation often occurs when eukaryotic proteins are overexpressed in a heterologous host such as E. coli [79]. Inclusion bodies have been considered a significant obstacle to producing soluble and active recombinant proteins [80,81]. In Table 1, most of the cold-active lipase and esterase were overexpressed in soluble forms, and only five (5) were produced as insoluble or soluble but in inactive forms. It is difficult to explain why most articles we examined in this review reported more soluble expression than insoluble inclusion bodies. Furthermore, there has been a great success not only in using biochemical and molecular techniques to prevent their formation or to address various challenges during their isolation, solubilisation, refolding, and purification [80], but their biological activity is also emerging [82,83] contrary to the previous notion that they lack activity [78].

            "text": "Protein expression in E. coli is relatively simple and inexpensive and the variety of available plasmids, fusion partners and strains makes it often the preferred method for production of AMPs [103,104]. However, major drawbacks have been reported using bacteria for effective AMP production as discussed below. \n\nFirst of all, the recombinant protein often needs to be fused to a carrier protein to neutralize its toxicity towards the host and to increase its solubility to avoid formation of inclusion bodies [105]. This fusion partner needs to be released during or after purification of the protein of interest via enzymatic or chemical cleavage to render functional proteins, which results in a decreased yield [102]. In addition, fusion proteins are not necessarily properly folded and production of these proteins can result in so-called \"soluble inclusion bodies\" [105]. Recently, it was shown that co-expression of the human Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase (QSOX), a chaperone with thiol/disulphide oxidase activity, in the cytoplasm of E. coli can counter protein misfolding and increase the yield of soluble cysteine-rich proteins [106,107]. Although such approach improves protein production in E. coli, other obstacles remain. \n\nDirect secretion mechanisms are not present in E. coli strains used for recombinant protein production, which complicates protein purification. Protein secretion can be obtained, however, by destabilization of the E. coli structural components or by using leaky strains that lack certain structural components or mutant strains in which secretion modules derived from pathogenic E. coli or other species are incorporated [103,[108][109][110][111]. \n\nFinally, and most importantly, the protein of interest often requires complex folding, including the formation of multiple disulphide bonds and/or glycosylation. In both cases, an eukaryotic system is preferred [112]. In addition, Puertas and colleagues reported that the protein yield, when using E. coli as a host for recombinant production, is inversely proportional to the cysteine content of the protein [113].",

When a large quantity of protein is expressed, macromolecular crowding (200-300 mg/ml in the cytoplasm) presents an unfavorable environment for protein folding. Frequently, the result of a high concentration of incorrectly folded recombinant protein is the formation of inclusion bodies [30]. In fact, the level of aggregated protein can increase to the extent that inclusion bodies are observable by light microscopy as round bodies surrounding the cytosol of E. coli [31]. While the formation of inclusion bodies does aVord protection from proteolytic degradation, and re-folding can recover active proteins from inactive inclusion bodies, the initial expression of correctly folded, soluble recombinant protein is ideal [32].\n\nSeveral strategies have been developed to promote the expression of properly folded recombinant protein, including co-expression of molecular chaperones [2] and foldases [33], expression of secreted proteins [34], and expression of protein fusions [35].

            "text": "complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011). Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012). Moreover, the industrial culture of E. coli leads cells to grow in harsh conditions, resulting in cell physiology deterioration (Chou, 2007;Pacheco et al., 2012).\n\nDespite the above-mentioned issues of E. coli recombinant protein production, the benefits of cost and ease of use and scale make it essential to design new strategies directed for recombinant soluble protein production in this host cell. Several strategies have been made for efficient production of proteins in E. coli, namely, the use of different mutated host strains, co-production of chaperones and foldases, lowering cultivation temperatures, and addition of a fusion partner (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). The combination of some of these strategies has improved the soluble production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, but the prediction of robust soluble protein production processes is still a \"a challenge and a necessity\" (Jana and Deb, 2005).\n\nNowadays, with the aid of genetic and protein engineering, novel tailor-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements.\n\nThis review describes the key solubility factors that correlate with successful protein production in E. coli, and it presents a comprehensive summary of the available fusion partners for protein production and purification in the bacterial host. A main focus is given to the novel Fh8 fusion system (Hitag \u00ae ) for soluble protein production, purification and immunogenicity in",

            "text": "Proteins are now widely produced in diverse microbial cell factories. The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

            "text": "Rapid production of recombinant proteins can lead to the formation of insoluble aggregates designated as inclusion bodies (Betts and King, 1999). These are large, spherical particles which are clearly separated from the cytoplasm and result from the failure of the quality control system to repair or remove misfolded or unfolded protein. \n\nThe formation of inclusion bodies does not correlate with (1) the size of the synthesized polypeptide, (2) the use of the fusion construct, (3) the subunit structure and (4) the relative hydrophobicity of the recombinant protein. Overproduction by itself (the increase in the concentration of the nascent polypeptide chains) can be sufficient to induce the formation of inclusion bodies. These aggregates do not consist of pure recombinant polypeptide chains, but contain several impurities such as host proteins (RNA polymerase, outer membrane proteins), ribosomal components and circular and nicked forms of plasmid DNA. In addition, they might contain the small heat shock proteins IbpA and IbpB. Strategies to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies are aimed to slow down the production of recombinant proteins and include (1) low-copy number vectors, (2) weak promoters, (3) low temperature, (4) coexpression of molecular chaperones, (5) use of a solubilizing partner, and (6) fermentation at extreme pH values. \n\nA lower level of protein synthesis from a weaker promoter or from a strong promoter under conditions of partial induction is found to result in a higher amount of soluble protein and greater specific activity (Hockney, 1994). Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc. We have mentioned an expression system which is specifically induced at low temperature, and together with the molecular chaperones derived from the Antarctic seawater bacterium, it may create a new and powerful system to obtain correctly folded proteins.",

            "text": "However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production. [1,4,5] rotein expression in E. coli generally takes place in either cytoplasm or periplasmic space. Reductive environment of the cytoplasm tends to express the proteins into inclusion bodies due to inefficient formation of disulfide bridges, whereas periplasmic space is the preferred choice for the soluble expression due to presence of oxidizing environment for proper folding. Antibody fragments are engineered with signal sequence for directing them to periplasmic space for proper folding. [6,7] he resultant periplasmic extract is thereby already enriched for the recombinant protein of interest, with the periplasmic containing only around 4-8% of the natural E. coli cellular proteins, making purification simpler. The periplasmic extract is also of lower volume than a whole cell lysate. In addition, periplasmic protease activity is far lower than that in the cytoplasm, reducing proteolysis of the recombinant protein product. [6] arious reports have shown that increased production of recombinant antibody fragments have soluble expression below 30 C. Lowering the cultivation temperature during induction increases the refolding of protein and reduces aggregation due to the lowered translation rate. Control of the growth temperature during fermentation is a facile method that allows stable expression of heterologous proteins. A direct consequence of temperature reduction is the partial elimination of heat shock proteases that are induced under overexpression conditions. [8] A similar transcriptional effect is achieved when a moderately strong or weak promoter is used or when a strong promoter is partially induced. [3] Low induction levels have been found to result in higher amounts of soluble protein. [9] It was concluded that the low temperature was beneficial to folding and the system was suggested as a tool for expression and correct folding of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Temperature downshift to 15 or 23 C abolished degradation of the fusion protein and the toxic phenotype associated with expression at 37 C was suppressed.",

The ATPindependent sHsps mainly function to hold partially denatured proteins, preventing them from further aggregation, and deliver them to Hsp70 for refolding (30). The co-overexpression of a sHsp and Hsp70 would be a reasonable next approach to further improve cell growth and recombinant protein accumulation. \n\nTo overcome the adverse effect of acetate on recombinant protein accumulation, previous studies developed transgenic E. coli that generated reduce levels of acetate. For example, low levels of acetate (50 mM) significantly inhibit cell growth and recombinant Thermus maltogenic amylase (ThMA) production by 90% (31). Compared with the unmodified control, the double-mutant transgenic E. coli with both acetate kinase (ackA) and phosphotransacetylase (pta) genes mutated and the triple-mutant transgenic E. coli with ackA-pta-Lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) genes mutated produced reduced levels of acetate and a higher yield of recombinant ThMA production.

            "text": "Different systems expressing periplasmic OPH in Escherichia coli expression systems have been developed using twin-arginine translocation or sec pathway-driven pathways, involving many advantages including simplified downstream processing, enhanced biological activity, conducting in vivo activity assays due to greater access of the targeted protein to the substrate, higher product stability and solubility, N-terminal authenticity of the expressed protein, simpler and cost effective purification due to a lower protein content compared to the cytoplasm, and providing the oxidative environment required for correct protein folding (13)(14)(15). However, the low secretion efficiency, incomplete secretion of recombinant protein, insufficient capacity for secretion of overexpressed recombinant protein, the death of host cells, and proteolytic degradation of the product in E. coli periplasmic expression systems are problematic despite some successful examples (16). The intracellular produc-tion of recombinant proteins in E. coli cytoplasm which is widely used has several advantages over the secretion of recombinant proteins to the periplasm; however, improper folding of many target proteins may occur during this process. \n\nImproper folding often results in the formation of inclusion bodies despite attempts to optimize the growth condition (17). No significant property was detected to recognize those proteins that have tendency to make inclusion bodies. Correct folding of proteins in cytoplasm can be achieved using several methods which are protein-specific, such as culturing at low temperatures, lowering the protein expression. Although the high protein production in the cytoplasm makes the purification of the soluble target proteins difficult, inclusion bodies have several advantages compared to soluble proteins including the higher accumulation in cytoplasm and increased protein yields as they are proteolysis-resistant, which could be isolated by a simple centrifugation step (15). Accordingly, choosing a suitable strategy to produce a recombinant protein is completely protein-specific.",

            "text": "Despite all the mentioned advantages, E. coli has not been successfully adopted as a host for rHSA production. \n\nThe major difficulty in exploiting E. coli as a host for rHSA production is aggregation of this disulfide-rich, multidomain human protein during overexpression in the E. coli cytoplasm. Evidence had been presented that the majority of the expressed recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) formed aggregates (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) leading to inclusion body formation in the reducing environment of the E. coli cytosol [17,18]. Recovery of functional protein from inclusion bodies in vitro is a difficult, time-consuming, laborious and expensive task for such a multidomain and disulfide bond rich protein. Because of such limitations, E. coli as a host system was neglected for rHSA production. Therefore, designing advanced strategies to obtain protein in soluble form in vivo could bypass the tedious in vitro refolding strategies. \n\nAfter considering the advantages of E. coli as a host, the present work has targeted E. coli as an alternate host system for rHSA production through resolving the major issue of inclusion body formation associated with it. \n\nIn the present communication, we have demonstrated the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of HSA. Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction and cell lysis conditions etc., play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form have been optimized. We have studied the effect of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. We have also examined different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in the presence and absence of exogenous molecular chaperones-GroEL-ES and trigger factor (TF). \n\nHere, we are reporting the development of a simple, novel and innovative method for enhanced soluble and functional production of rHSA in E. coli. It has been achieved through modulation of basic yet very crucial parameters like the cellular growth, protein folding, and environmental parameters.",

            "text": "Enzymatic catalysis provides tremendous opportunities for industry to carry out efficient and economical biocatalytic conversions. Traditional markets include the food and feed industry, but enzymatic processes are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as fine chemical production and pharmaceutical industries [1]. Cost-efficient high-yield production of the biocatalysts, usually by heterologous expression in bacterial or yeast systems, is critical for the economic viability of such processes. The choice of the production host depends on several properties of the target protein itself. If posttranslational modifications are not required, prokaryotic systems like E. coli are most attractive due to high productivity, low cost and easy handling. However, overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria can cause problems like the production of insoluble aggregates of misfolded and inactive proteins called inclusion bodies (IB). Inclusion bodies consist of the overproduced polypeptide aggregated with small amounts of foreign proteins and nucleic acids [2]. Strategies for resolving this problem and for optimizing expression levels in E. coli have already been reported [3][4][5][6][7] and include the application of well-characterized expression systems under the control of tightly regulated promoters as well as the application of different expression conditions. In general, reduced cell growth, caused by lowered temperatures or oxygen limitation, promotes the expression of complex heterologous proteins in an active and soluble form and reduces IB formation [8][9][10][11]. Overdrive of inducer, on the other hand, results in IB formation and cell damage, whereas limited induction is favorable for native enzyme production [12]. Refolding of IB is widely discussed in literature [13,14], but is not possible for every given protein. \n\nIn this study we analyzed different expression systems for the production of recombinant pyranose 2-oxidase (POx; pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase; glucose 2-oxidase; EC 1.1.3.10) from Trametes multicolor in the prokaryotic host E. coli.",

On the other hand, the newly synthesized recombinant polypeptide is expressed in the microenvironment of the host that may differ from that of the original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, cofactors, and folding mechanisms. High local concentrations of the nascent heterologous protein together with an insufficient amount of folding-promoting chaperons may lead to partially folded or misfolded protein intermediates that give rise to the formation, in both the cytoplasm and periplasm, of insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies, IBs [77]. Usually, these intermediates expose on their surface hydrophobic patches that interact with similar regions and together with the formation of uncorrected disulfide bonds can lead to protein aggregation and precipitation Protein recovery strategies from inclusion bodies via solubilization and refolding processes are laborious, time-consuming and expensive, although various refolding procedures have been developed for therapeutic proteins and applied for antibody fragments [78][79][80]. An introduction to the IB refolding procedure [81] is outside the scope of this review. Rather, we will look at other more profitable and convenient strategies such as periplasmic and extracellular expression strategies and also co-expression with molecular chaperons for improving solubility and proper folding of antibody-like fragments, even on a laboratory scale.",

Due to shortages in chaperone availability, a significant portion of the recombinant product may be deposited in these insoluble aggregates ( Figure 4A). Since it is still unknown what percentage of active product is present in the IBs [11], we further analyzed the distribution of   Figure 4C).\n\nOur analysis shows that the native expression system without feedback leads to the highest amount of total GFP, but at the same time with a high percentage of insoluble GFP in the cell ( Figure 4B and 4C). Some variants with the feedback-based expression system were found to increase the soluble fraction, albeit at the expense of lower protein yield. The observed dynamics are consistent with what we would expect due to the trade-off between protein solubility and yield. The reduced protein yield is expected as the feedback mechanism is designed to reduce GFP expression upon stress. Interestingly, variability across clones was also observed here, with some clones retaining the protein yield and quality of the native expression system, while others favoring protein solubility over protein yield, for the wild type P IbpAB promoter (with strong RBS) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The intracellular levels of TetR protein were analyzed by Western blot analysis and support data obtained throughout the study showing that different variants and combinations of stress promoter and RBS indeed resulted in different intracellular TetR levels, with similar variability as in the case of GFP expression ( Figure 4D).",

Although these fusion proteins overexpressed in E. coli were enzymatically active in both soluble and insoluble (aggregate) fractions. The present paper thus delineates the proteomic profiles of overproducing bacteria and presents results that could be useful for conceive a strategy to improve the production of soluble recombinant proteins. \n\nRecombinant protein overexpression has been known to induce significant physiological changes such as the stress response to heat-shock in E. coli [6]. The presence of the inducer isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) alone can even influence E. coli metabolism substantially, altering the synthesis of certain proteins [7]. When a recombinant protein is expressed at high rates, the system of cytosolic chaperones and proteases in bacteria is presumably induced to express in an altered pattern, in comparison with the host cells without overexpressing recombinant proteins. In addition to facilitating the folding of nascent proteins, several molecular chaperones and heat shock proteins are induced to inhibit the formation of inclusion bodies by reducing aggregation and promoting proteolysis of misfolded proteins. The simultaneous overexpression of chaperone/ heat shock protein encoding genes and recombinant target proteins proved effective in several instances [8]. To increase the solubility of recombinant proteins, the cooverproduction of individual chaperones as well as the combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol has been attempted [9]. Based on experimental results, Garcia-Fruitos et al. suggested that the so-called E. coli quality control system (made up of chaperones and proteases) acts coordinately to promote solubility at the expense of conformational quality [10]. A study of global changes in protein expression that occur in response to the rapid synthesis of a recombinant protein would therefore help to elucidate the mechanisms regulating recombinant protein solubility.",

            "text": "However, some of these stress reactions tend to impact in higher yields of product [1]. Still, down-stream processing (DSP) and especially the refolding unit operation is the most time-consuming step in gaining the correctly folded product from E. coli cultivations [17][18][19][20], which requires significantly more technology and time, when purifying protein aggregates for pharmaceutical products [19,23]. In recent years IBs were found to exhibit not only inactive protein structures, but also parts which show enzyme activity [24]. These IBs are nowadays called non-classical Inclusion Bodies (ncIBs) and inherit highly active protein, directly without time-consuming refolding steps [25][26][27]. Active parts of the IB may also be directly used as biocatalysts in different reactions, combining the well mechanical properties with enzymatic reactivity. It has also been shown, that the size has an influence on the biological activity of the protein [28,29]. Beside their enzymatic usage, IBs may also be used based on their mechanical properties as they generally inhibit a distinct bead size combined with high mechanical stability. Therefore, application as nanoparticulate material and as material for tissue engineering is considered [17,28,30]. For all these mentioned applications, IB bead size can be regarded as critical quality attribute (CQA). Changes in size are known to be based on the harvest time during the cultivation. In a recent study, we analyzed detailed effects of classical process parameters pH and temperature on the IB bead size as a function of the induction time [22]. Therefore, control of IB size during the cultivation is an important issue as size is a CQA during these processes. Process performance needs to be directed towards optimal size needed in DSP for pharmaceutical relevant components. \n\nEffects of feeding strategies onto product quality have been already investigated by Spadiut et al. [31] as alterations of the specific growth rate are known to have major influences onto product formation. As high recombinant protein production does implement changes in cell physiology, it is known that there is a decreased growth rate over the duration of induction time [32].",

It is difficult to decide which combination of host organism-promoter system would be the best for specific recombinant protein production; therefore this still has to be optimized for each product individually. \n\nSince Escherichia coli have all the above described advantages [1] and the laboratory strains are regarded as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organisms, it is still one of the most commonly used bacterial host system, not only on laboratory scale use, but also for production of therapeutic proteins [2][3][4][5]. \n\nHowever, during recombinant protein production in E. coli, proteins often tend to aggregate into protein particles called inclusion bodies (IBs). Until recently, IBs were considered as deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins and represented bottleneck in recombinant protein production. Therefore many pharmaceutically interesting proteins have been disregarded for commercialization [6]. Nevertheless, the latest studies on protein aggregation have shown that protein aggregation into IBs does not necessarily imply protein inactivation [7][8][9][10] thus studies on protein aggregation has become an important subject in many fields, including biology, medicine and biotechnology [11]. This article gives an overview on the latest trends in recombinant protein production in E. coli, their aggregation and the possible applications of such protein particles (IBs).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields [1]. Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs [2,3]. To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins [1][2][3]. A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs [4][5][6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product [7]. \n\nAnother obstacle in recombinant protein production in E. coli cells is accumulation of acetate during extensive aerobic fermentation in cultures supplemented with glucose. At higher glucose concentrations, the carbon flux into the cells exceeds tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, and acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate, which is easily excreted from the cell. The excretion of acetate into the environment results also from the need to regenerate the NAD + consumed by glycolysis and to recycle the CoA that is required to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [8]. A high concentration of acetate, externally added or excreted from the cell, limits the growth of E. coli.",

            "text": "There has been a growing interest from researchers in expressing recombinant proteins in the periplasm of E. coli [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] , owing to the attractiveness of periplasmic expression. For example, periplasmic expression significantly facilitates downstream purification and produces target proteins with authentic N-terminal sequences upon proper cleavage of signal peptides 9 , which is otherwise not achievable through cytoplasmic expression. In addition, periplasm is the only oxidizing compartment in genetically unmodified E. coli cells and also the host to various chaperones and foldases 10 . These proteins and enzymes play crucial roles in facilitating proper protein folding and disulfide bond formation to ensure their biological functions.\n\nThe solubility of recombinant proteins upon expression in E. coli has been a main focus in protein expression studies. Overexpression of proteins generally gives high yield, but mostly in the form of inclusion bodies 11,12 . Despite the advantage of producing higher protein yield in the form of inclusion bodies, a series of onerous and expensive tasks are involved in resolubilizing the protein aggregates and refolding them 13 . Furthermore, there is no guarantee of retaining the biological activity of a protein after its refolding. Significant decrease in production yield upon refolding and purification is also common 9 . There are a number of examples of studies that report on the formation of inclusion bodies when proteins were heterologously expressed in the periplasm [14][15][16][17] , which suggest the possibility of inclusion body formation during periplasmic expression under certain conditions. On one hand, it is well-known that amino acid sequence is the major determinant of protein solubility 11,18,19 . The choice of signal peptide, on the other hand, has also been recognized as another important factor that strongly influences the protein secretion efficiency 20 and also affects the protein expression yield in the periplasm. The rate Scientific RepoRts | 6:21844 | DOI: 10.1038/srep21844 of protein folding also influences the amount of proteins expressed, and can be estimated from the amino acid sequences [21][22",

            "text": "In this investigation, we evaluated the heterologous prokaryotic expression of codon-optimized rotavirus A VP6 in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Subsequent protein extraction and solubility analysis revealed an abundant presence of the recombinant protein within the insoluble fraction, contrasting with the preferred localization within the soluble fraction for efficient downstream processing, including protein purification, formulation, characterization, and functional studies. This phenomenon underscores a common challenge associated with high-level heterologous protein expression in bacterial systems, where the propensity for protein inclusion body formation presents a substantial impediment to protein research endeavours 44 . While protein recovery from inclusion bodies is indeed possible, the process entails labour-intensive and time-consuming procedures, resulting in inevitable protein loss at each stage. Additionally, the absence of a universal technique emphasizes the necessity for a trialand-error approach to identify optimal strategies, thereby highlighting the intricate nature of protein handling in such instances. Therefore, to optimize soluble protein expression, a series of experimental conditions were systematically investigated for VP6 expression in the prokaryotic host. This included varying the concentration of the inducer (IPTG), post-induction temperature, post-induction incubation time with and without PMSF. These efforts were undertaken with the objective of enhancing protein solubility. \n\nThe inducer concentration profoundly influences the soluble protein fraction in E. coli expression systems. Higher concentrations typically yield elevated protein expression levels, potentially leading to a greater proportion of protein. Excessively high inducer concentrations can also lead to cellular stress or saturation of protein folding machinery, potentially causing misfolding, aggregation, and a decrease in solubility. Conversely, lower inducer concentrations may result in reduced protein expression but could enhance solubility by allowing for more controlled folding. However, excessively low inducer concentrations may not provide sufficient stimulation for protein expression, leading to inadequate levels of soluble protein. Thus, an optimal inducer concentration is crucial, striking a balance between robust protein expression and efficient folding to maximize soluble protein fraction while minimizing aggregation and cellular stress 52 .",

            "text": "Many studies have focused on optimizing the production processes for recombinant proteins, with the aim of reducing the accumulation of insoluble inclusion bodies. In contrast, solubilization and refolding of protein from inclusion bodies is a common strategy although it requires denaturing conditions and a subsequent renaturing step, usually resulting in poor soluble protein recoveries [32,33]. Different approaches have been developed to prevent the accumulation of inclusion bodies in E. coli, such as the optimization of culture conditions, co-expression with molecular chaperones [34,35], lower growth temperature during gene induction [35,36], induction expression in early-log phase culture [37], and induction with lower levels of inducer concentration, such as Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [38]. In addition, several fusion tags have been developed to increase the solubility of overexpressed proteins, although with variable degrees of success. Currently, available fusion systems include maltose-binding polypeptide (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ubiquitin (SUMO), thioredoxin (TrxA), and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) [39]. The use of a fusion partner may increase the solubility of the protein and may significantly contribute to an increase in the expression yields under different conditions. The data presented here revealed a higher number (p = 0.05) of proteins obtained in the soluble form when fused with GFP tag (pHTP9) (Figure 3C) compared with proteins that only included a histidine tag (pHTP1). Although this suggests higher solubility through the expression with the GFP fusion, only a controlled study in which the same proteins are expressed in the fusion with the two different fusion tags would allow a more insightful elucidation of the impact of GFP on protein solubility.",

            "text": "Reducing the growth temperature down to 25 or 20 \u00b0C also lowers the productivity of the cells. Coexpression of folder chaperones such as the DnaK or the GroE system might help in some cases to keep the recombinant proteins soluble (Nishihara et al., 1998). Solubilizing partners are other proteins which are fused to the recombinant proteins and keep the hybrid proteins soluble. When three different proteins known to increase the solubility (maltose-binding protein [MBP], glutathione-Stransferase [GST] and thioredoxin [TRX] were fused to six different recombinant proteins, MBP turned out to be superior (Kapust and Waugh, 1999). \n\nSometimes, it might be desirable to produce recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies. How can active proteins become recovered from aggregates? This involves a fourstep procedure. During the first step, the inclusion bodies are harvested by cell lysis and centrifugation of the cell lysate at 5,000 to 12,000 x g. Under these conditions, the protein aggregates will be present in the pellet. The second step involves solubilization of the inclusion bodies by resuspension of the pellet in a buffer with a denaturant agent such as 6 M guanidinium chloride or 6-8 M urea. During the next step, the solubilized polypeptide chains are purified by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of nonionic denaturants such as urea. The fourth and last step results in in vitro protein folding. Folding can be aided by the addition of low-molecular weight folding enhancers such as 1.0-1.3 M guanidiumchloride, 2 M urea or polyethyleneglycol. If the recombinant protein contains one or more disulfide bonds, generation of native bonds can be sustained by addition of reduced and oxidized glutathione. \n\nDesign of an optimal expression system for E. coli Based on our present knowledge, we can propose the design of an optimal expression system for E. coli.",

To our knowledge, a repetitive fed-batch cultivation mode using E. coli has only been implemented for pyruvate production (Zeli\u0107 et al., 2004). However, the potential of using E. coli in repetitive fedbatch mode for recombinant protein production has not been investigated yet. \n\nIn this study we performed repetitive fed-batch cultivations for recombinant protein production using the production host E. coli in combination with lactose induction. In previous studies, the negative side effects of IPTG induction onto recombinant protein production in long-term fermentations were shown, whereas lactose was found to have a beneficial effect on productivity (Malakar and Venkatesh, 2012;Dvorak et al., 2015;Kopp et al., 2019a). We believe that no studies on repetitive fed-batch cultivation with E. coli for recombinant protein production have been published yet, either due to toxic effects of IPTG and the consequent decreasing productivity over time (Dvorak et al., 2015;Kopp et al., 2019b) or due to the absence of an induction strategy comparable to the established yeast system (Fricke et al., 2013). The goal of this study was to compare productivities and space-time yields of different production modes for E. coli. The assessment of changes in product quality and purity was not in the scope of this study. For the first time, we were able to show that a repetitive fed-batch cultivation mode using our developed lactose induction strategy is able to outperform conventional fed-batches and chemostat cultivations regarding the overall space-time yield.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production via prokaryotic system has brought hundreds of therapeutic proteins into clinical applications or clinical trials over the past few decades (Dimitrov, 2012;S\u00e1nchez-Trasvi\u00f1a et al., 2021). Recombinant proteins are frequently soluble. In some cases, when high-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli occurs, insoluble aggregates accumulate as inclusion bodies. Numerous strategies were attempted to overcome this problem, such as the optimization of bacterial strains, promoters, inducers, as well as the use of N-terminal signal peptides (SPs), which could help recombinant proteins be secreted into the culture medium (Tegel et al., 2011;Chen, 2012;Freudl, 2018;Owji et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2019). Compared to intracellular expression, extracellular production of proteins possesses several advantages. First, extracellular expression could prevent aggregations of proteins and accumulation of inclusion bodies. Second, protein secretion from cytoplasm to periplasm provides an oxidative environment, which facilitates correct protein folding and disulfide bond formation (Ruiz et al., 2006;Mergulh\u00e3o and Monteiro, 2007;Silhavy et al., 2010;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Kleiner-Grote et al., 2018;Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2021), which is essential for their biological activities. Moreover, secretion of proteins into growth medium requires no cell disruption as well as downstream purification steps, reducing the complexity of bioprocess and significantly improving product purity since there is no intracellular protein contamination (Kleiner-Grote et al., 2018;Green et al., 2019;Yao et al., 2019;Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2021). Therefore, a variety of strategies have been taken to accomplish extracellular expression (Ni and Chen, 2009). \n\nProteins are generally exported via the general secretory (Sec) pathway (Costa et al., 2015;Burdette et al., 2018), which commonly exists in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Cao and Saier, 2003).",

            "text": "Functional expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic hosts is of considerable industrial interest, with applications ranging from therapeutic proteins and recombinant enzyme production to metabolic engineering for synthesizing value-added biomolecules [1,2]. However, recombinant protein overexpression in prokaryotic hosts commonly results in protein aggregate formations, termed inclusion bodies [3], which far exceed the host folding capacity. Accordingly, costly and time-consuming in-vitro refolding processes have been widely applied to recover functionally active proteins in their soluble forms. Furthermore, inclusion body formation is generally harmful to the host through increased cellular metabolic burden and intermolecular interactions with other cellular components [4,5], reducing cell viability and overall production yield. \n\nIn vivo and in vitro strategies to solubilize recombinant proteins to an active conformation during the initial production process [6] include solubility-enhancing tags to intrinsically prevent misfolded protein formation in-vivo [7][8][9], physicochemical condition modification to balance translational and folding processes [10,11], and molecular chaperone overexpression to improve host disaggregation and folding capacity [12][13][14]. Molecular chaperones, which can assist cells in coping with stress-induced protein denaturation [15,16], constitute powerful tools to produce functionally active and water-soluble recombinant proteins. Among the options, the use of molecular chaperones is more cost-effective and less time-consuming as no post-translational processing and compromises in cell growth conditions are required. However, straightforward native chaperone co-overexpression with target proteins yields only limited solubilization during recombinant protein production. Although abundant molecular chaperones may be available through the chaperone co-expression approaches, these may not effectively diffuse through the crowded cytosol to interact in a timely fashion with a nascent polypeptide before the mis-foldings happen [17].",

            "text": "Recombinant Protein Enhancement 7.1. Coexpression Studies. Coexpression is another strategy employed to enhance protein stability, solubility, and bioactivity [3,4]. The use of chaperone systems such as GroEL-GroES and DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, or the coexpression of proteins in the presence of trigger factors has been shown to enhance protein solubility [37]. Chaperones specifically favour the solubility of target proteins, thus, coexpression systems tend to favour the solubility of target proteins. Soluble expression (in E. coli) of the bacteriophage T4 gene 23 product (major capsid protein) was shown be enhanced by the coexpression of gene product 31 (phage co-chaperonin gp31) [38]. Alternatively, protein production yield, solubility, and folding can be improved through fusion partners or tags (Table 1) [3,4]. \n\n7.2. Affinity Tags. Protein fusion has been approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use over 30 years now [39]. Affinity tags are the longstanding tradition for recombinant protein purification, and they have been used to improve protein yield, prevent proteolysis, and increase solubility. Furthermore, fusion partners can translocate passenger protein into different locations with less number of proteases within the cell, thus protecting the produced proteins from degradation. Such fusion partners are maltose-binding protein (MBP) and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) which could move target protein in the cytosol of E. coli to membrane and nucleus, respectively. The MBP and N-utilizing substance A (NusA) are also among the potent solubility-enhancing proteins [40]. Many proteins produce insoluble inclusion bodies during bacterial expression, and only a limited amount (25%) of soluble protein is produced. Therefore, fusion tags are introduced into the recombinant construct when E. coli is used thus enhance protein solubility [41].",

In this manner, rhBMP-4 was overexpressed in inclusion bodies. These were solubilized as described in the \"material and methods\" section and subjected to in vitro refolding. Initial refolding attempts based on BMP-2 renaturation protocols [12,13] resulted in aggregation of the protein and did not lead to dimer formation. Alternative additives were included in the renaturation protocol which helped to solubilize the proteins and prevent precipitation. Commonly used additives for promoting protein refolding include amino acids (e. g. L-arginine) and detergents such as CHAPS. Rapid dilution of solubilized inclusion bodies was performed into buffers containing different concentrations of L-arginine and CHAPS. Increasing the amount of L-arginine and CHAPS enhanced the refolding yield of rhBMP-4. The combination of both additives at their optimal concentrations did not result in refolding yields significantly exceeding 15% (see Fig. 1). \n\nRenaturation was performed using protein concentrations between 50 and 100 mg/ml. Higher amounts of protein resulted in protein aggregation, thereby drastically reducing the refolding yield of soluble protein.",

Currently, the K-12 E. coli strain and its derivatives [49,75] are routinely used in production. Despite the use of E. coli strains as the system of choice, these microorganisms are not free from disadvantages affecting production processes. E. coli contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS endotoxin), for which reason the proteins obtained in this system need to be specially purified, so that they could be used in the production of biopharmaceuticals applied in human and animal therapy [78]. After entering the bloodstream, bacterial endotoxins can cause fever, hypotension, respiratory failure, endotoxic shock and ultimately sepsis. Therefore, many methods have been developed to remove endotoxins from recombinant protein preparations [45]. In addition, the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli can lead to the formation of inactive, insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs). One of the methods to avoid or reduce the production of IB is to lower the temperature or change the culture conditions, which will cause both an increase in protein expression and will affect its solubility [23].\n\nThe first biopharmaceutical produced by means of genetic engineering in E. coli was human insulin. It was achieved by David Goeddel's team (Genentech) in 1978. Next, Genentech and Lilly signed an agreement for the commercialization of recombinant insulin, which was authorized by the FDA in 1982. These were Humulin R (rapid-acting insulin) and Humulin N (NPH, indirect--acting insulin) preparations [32,56]. Most recombinant proteins with therapeutic properties produced in the E. coli system are used in the treatment of infectious diseases, the group of endocrine diseases or metabolic disorders [20].

Bacterial inclusion bodies are major bottlenecks in protein production and are hampering the development of top priority research areas such structural genomics. Inclusion body formation was formerly considered to occur via non-specific association of hydrophobic surfaces in folding intermediates. Increasing evidence, however, indicates that protein aggregation in bacteria resembles to the well-studied process of amyloid fibril formation. Both processes appear to rely on the formation of specific, sequence-dependent, intermolecular interactions driving the formation of structured protein aggregates. This similarity in the mechanisms of aggregation will probably allow applying anti-aggregational strategies already tested in the amyloid context to the less explored area of protein aggregation inside bacteria. Specifically, new sequence-based approaches appear as promising tools to tune protein aggregation in biotechnological processes.",

Factors, such as lack of glycosylation, easier production, high expression levels, high cell densities, and low production costs compared to other available expression platforms contribute to popularity of the E. coli platform. \n\nThe last few decades have witnessed significant advancements in cloning strategies, expression, and purification, thereby resulting in improved production of useful antibody-like fragments utilizing E. coli expression system. [1,2] he production process is typically quite simple. The desired gene of interest is cloned into a suitable expression vector, which is further transformed into choice of host, cultivated and induced, and protein is extracted and purified. Post purification, the protein is further characterized for structure and function. [3] However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

            "text": "According to the location of synthesized heterologous proteins in E. coli, they can be classified into different groups. Heterologous proteins can be localized in three different spaces including cytoplasm, periplasm, and extracellular space (secretion into the culture medium) (Fig. 3) (Kleiner-Grote et al. 2018). Accumulation of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm is the most common strategy for recombinant protein production in E. coli, which requires the simplest expression system and demonstrates the highest yield (Makrides 1996). The formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) is one of the bottlenecks in the accumulation of overexpressed recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm (Carri\u00f3 and Villaverde 2001;Ventura and Villaverde 2006). In this case, there is a need to solubilize and refold the aggregated proteins and as a result reduce the yield and bioactivity of the recombinant proteins (Bhatwa et al. 2021). E. coli cytosol has a reducing environment and is not a suitable environment for the expression of recombinant proteins with disulfide bridges. The periplasm of E.coli is a suitable space for proteins that contain disulfide bonds in their structures. These bonds are essential for protein folding and activity (Paraskevopoulou et al. 2022b). Recombinant protein secretion into the periplasm or in the culture medium has many advantages over the intracellular production of recombinant proteins in the form of IBs. It helps in the natural folding and stability of proteins and also helps in the production of active and soluble proteins at a reduced cost (Mergulh\u00e3o et al. 2005). To translocation of the recombinant proteins into the periplasm from the cytosol, various signal peptides have been proposed and utilized (Karyolaimos et al. 2019;Maleki and Hajihassan 2021;Santos et al. 2019). The presence of a small amount of protease and protein in the periplasm as compared to the cytoplasm facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins. One of the most important aspects",

            "text": "The overproduction of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli leads to insoluble aggregates of proteins called inclusion bodies (IBs). IBs are considered dynamic entities that harbor high percentages of the recombinant protein, which can be found in different conformational states. The production conditions influence the properties of IBs and recombinant protein recovery and solubilization. The E. coli growth in thermoinduced systems is generally carried out at 30 \u00b0C and then recombinant protein production at 42 \u00b0C. Since the heat shock response in E. coli is triggered above 34 \u00b0C, the synthesis of heat shock proteins can modify the yields of the recombinant protein and the structural quality of IBs. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different pre-induction temperatures (30 and 34 \u00b0C) on the growth of E. coli W3110 producing the human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) and on the IBs structure in a \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 thermoinducible system. The recombinant E. coli cultures growing at 34 \u00b0C showed a\u2009~\u200969% increase in the specific growth rate compared to cultures grown at 30 \u00b0C. The amount of rHuGM-CSF in IBs was significantly higher in cultures grown at 34 \u00b0C. Main folding chaperones (DnaK and GroEL) were associated with IBs and their co-chaperones (DnaJ and GroES) with the soluble protein fraction. Finally, IBs from cultures that grew at 34 \u00b0C had a lower content of amyloid-like structure and were more sensitive to proteolytic degradation than IBs obtained from cultures at 30 \u00b0C. Our study presents evidence that increasing the pre-induction temperature in a thermoinduced system allows obtaining higher recombinant protein and reducing amyloid contents of the IBs. \u2022 Pre-induction temperature determines inclusion bodies architecture \u2022 In pre-induction (above 34 \u00b0C), the heat shock response increases recombinant protein production \u2022 Inclusion bodies at higher pre-induction temperature show a lower amyloid content",

            "text": "Overexpression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli results in inclusion body formation, and consequently decreased production yield and increased production cost. Co-expression of chaperon systems accompanied by recombinant protein is a general method to increase the production yield. However, it has not been successful enough due to imposed intense stress to the host cells. The aim of this study was to balance the rate of protein production and the imposed cellular stresses using a two-step expression system. For this purpose, in the first step, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed as a recombinant protein model under control of the T7-TetO artificial promoter-operator, accompanied by Dnak/J/GrpE chaperon system. Then, in the next step, TetR repressor was activated automatically under the control of the stress promoter ibpAB and suppressed the GFP production after accumulation of inclusion bodies. Thus in this step incorrect folded proteins and inclusion bodies are refolded causing increased yield and solubility of the recombinant protein and restarting GFP expression again. Total GFP, soluble and insoluble GFP fractions, were measured by Synergy H1 multiple reader. Results showed that expression yield and soluble/insoluble ratio of GFP have been increased 5 and 2.5 times using this system in comparison with the single step process, respectively. The efficiency of this system in increasing solubility and production yield of recombinant proteins was confirmed. The two-step system must be evaluated for expression of various proteins to further confirm its applicability in the field of recombinant protein production.",

It has been described that inclusion bodies formed in E. coli under different expression conditions may differ in their quality and, therefore, their ability to yield active proteins [25,39,40]. To the best of my knowledge, the impact of codon optimization on the quality of inclusion bodies has not been previously studied. Thus, I decided to investigate the ability of inclusion bodies obtained from the expression of different gene variants to yield functional prochymosin. Inclusion bodies were prepared from cultures of E. coli W3110 strain harboring expression plasmids for the seven prochymosin gene variants described above. In all cases, inclusion bodies were washed after cell lysis and recovered as a white paste. The paste was dissolved in 8 M urea and the total protein concentration adjusted to 20 g/L. For all the preparations, PAGE analysis showed that more than 90% of the protein contained in the urea solution corresponds to calf prochymosin (data not shown). The urea solution was rapidly diluted into refolding buffer supplemented with 0.5 M arginine and 10 \u03bcM Cu ++ since these additives were previously shown to increase the refolding efficiency of prochymosin [18]. \n\nFigure 2 shows the refolding efficiency obtained for the different inclusion body preparations. No significant differences were found in the recovery of calf prochymosin for inclusion bodies prepared using the different gene variants. In the refolding method employed, air oxidation was used to promote the formation of disulphide bonds and the activity recovered was similar to that previously reported for the native sequence [18,41]",

            "text": "When expressing recombinant proteins in bacteria, one of the most common side effects is the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) [1]. Until recently IBs were thought of as blocks of misfolded and inactive proteins. As it was difficult and expensive to purify and refold recombinant proteins from such aggregates, a whole range of strategies was adopted to reduce or avoid IB formation. Surprisingly, although there was published evidence that inclusion bodies can also contain biologically active proteins [2,3], it was not until recently that this phenomenon was fully acknowledged and further investigated [4,5]. Many different protocols for IB production have been published, focusing on the various parameters that can affect IB quality such as the genetic background of the host organism, specific growth conditions and IB isolation [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. Furthermore, the term \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies (ncIBs) was introduced to describe IBs containing a significant amount of properly folded protein, which in addition could be extracted under non-denaturing conditions. Although the major factor in obtaining soluble IBs is the target protein's structure, the type of host organism used and the design of the biosynthesis process may also modulate IB size and degree of solubility. The fact that inclusion bodies may contain biologically active proteins has been already shown for a number of proteins, from GFP [4,16,17], to recombinant cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [5] and a number of enzymes [19][20][21][22][23]. Therefore, the development of IBs as a novel type of recombinant protein delivery machines has great potential with applications in medicine, and it has been also recently patented [24].\n\nThe aim of this study was to provide evidence that IBs may be also used as method of recombinant protein delivery for complex proteins. By using an already published protocol for IB production via the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain [17], we obtained keratin 14 (K14) ncIBs of several hundred",

            "text": "In this work, we employed a design of experimental methodology to optimize the production of recombinant anti-MICA scFv, MICA and IL-23p19 in E. coli. As expected, we found important yield differences at different environmental variables, with distinctive optimal conditions for each protein. In addition, for each protein studied, environmental variables had different effects on the generated models, reflecting some intrinsic protein properties that can affect protein biosynthesis and/or folding. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that insoluble proteins were markedly different at the preferred environmental conditions and amino acid content from a set of soluble proteins described in the literature. Finally, we showed that a simple refolding experiment can be successfully applied to obtain the best conditions for full-scale protein refolding. \n\nObtaining high yields of soluble protein can be challenging, as the majority of proteins tend to aggregate as inclusion bodies 25 . This can delay a successful expression experiment, given the rather complex steps needed to obtain native protein in this scenario. However, inclusion bodies have several advantages, such as high levels of protein expression and purity. Optimizing the expression of recombinant proteins in this compartment, as we show in the present work, is relatively uncommon, although it can be a very promising strategy. The three-level Box-Behnken design is relatively easy to run with standard laboratory equipment. After a three-day experiment, including protein expression, inclusion bodies purification and solubilization, purification and refolding, a researcher can have complete working space and obtain important insights to develop a more robust and productive expression system. The yields obtained for each protein varied significantly, as expected; however, more importantly, they varied between each run. These differences should be interpreted as room for improvement, and to the fact that obtaining protein in inclusion bodies can be fine-tuned by different environmental variables. \n\nAlthough there are other factors that can be optimized, including OD at induction, pre-induction time, the use of different plasmid constructions, the use of different hosts and codon optimization, we favored the speed of our analysis using factors widely reported in the literature 22,[26][27][28][29] .",

            "text": "Thus, the aggregated GST-Neu5Ac aldolase-5R proteins were still trapped in the insoluble fraction under conditions of low heat shock response. \n\nAlthough amplification of the genes encoding IbpA and IbpB could enhance the production of recombinant proteins, overexpression of IbpA and IbpB resulted in more aggregate (inclusion bodies) than soluble protein [18]. A previous study revealed that co-expression of heterologous proteins with a four-chaperone system (GroEL-GroES, DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE, ClpB and IbpA/IbpB) led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of various recombinant proteins [9]. These results suggest that these \u03c3 32 -regulated chaperones work together in a cooperative way. In many cases, bacterial inclusion bodies are formed by highly functional enzymatic forms and the solubility of the expressed proteins does not parallel conformational quality [10]. This is also true in the present work with the overexpression of doubletagged fusion proteins of GlcNAc 2-epimerase and Neu5Ac aldolase [5]. Because the protease-based heat shock protein HslU was up-regulated along with ClpB, we agree with the conclusion of Garcia-Fruitos et al. that the E. coli quality control system (composed of cytosolic chaperones and proteases) promotes protein solubility instead of conformational quality through over-committed proteolysis of aggregation-prone polypeptides, irrespective of their conformational status and biological properties [10]. In summary, maintaining the expression of \u03c3 32 at a high level could be a useful strategy for promoting the solubility of overexpressed proteins and misfolded polypeptides that restore their biological activity to some extent via enhanced expression of cytosolic chaperones.",

            "text": "Polypeptides entrapped in E. coli inclusion bodies exhibit a variable degree of folding organization under different production conditions [19,24]. Such degree of folding is frequently correlated with the \"quality\" of inclusion bodies because it has an impact on the yield of refolding and, therefore, the overall economy of the production process [45,46]. This led me to explore the impact of using codon-optimized sequences on the ability of the resulting inclusion bodies to yield active chymosin. The refolding efficiency obtained for inclusion bodies recovered from recombinant clones expressing the seven individual variants were very similar, suggesting that the tested DNA sequences did not alter the conformational quality of protein contained in the inclusion bodies. \n\nVariations in the rate of mRNA translation may influence the formation of secondary structures in the nascent polypeptide [47,48], and analysis of gene sequences and the structure of their encoded proteins show that frequently used codons are associated with structural elements, while strings of less used codons tend to be present in boundaries separating such elements. Thus, a redesigned gene where most abundant codons are placed to encode secondary structures (like alpha helices) and rare codons are placed to encode linkers, may lead to the formation of inclusion bodies of superior quality. In the redesigned genes tested in this work, codon assignment frequency was equally distributed all along the entire gene. A calf prochymosin gene designed taking into account the sequence/structure relationship may provide insights into the influence of codon optimization on the refolding efficiency. This work is currently in progress in our laboratory.",

            "text": "In this research, the heat shock method was used due to its advantages, which include not requiring specialized expression. Consequently, intracellular protein expression is often employed as a method to enhance recombinant protein production. However, intracellular protein expression in E. coli is subject to certain limitations, such as the formation of inclusion bodies. Multiple factors influence the formation of these inclusion bodies, including misfolding of proteins, low levels of chaperones, which impede proper protein conformation under reduced cytoplasmic conditions, and susceptibility to degradation by proteases [14]. To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19]. \n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is frequently used for the production of non-glycosylated proteins due to its well-characterized genome, cheap cultivation and fast growth (Rosano et al., 2019). However, high transcription rates of the target protein often lead to the formation of intracellular protein aggregates, known as inclusion bodies (IBs) (Lee & Hsu, 2018). IB formation can be reduced by either lowering the cultivation temperature during induction or by fusing solubility tags to the protein of interest. Still, the paradigm of IBs shifted and IB processing is applied in pharmaceutical industry up to date (Costa et al., 2014;Garc\u00eda-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2012;Rinas et al., 2017). The natural phenomenon of IB formation in E. coli has been known for decades (Fahnert et al., 2004;Rosano et al., 2019). In 2008, Lindner et al. established a model based on fluorescence microscopy data, describing the intracellular localization of native cell aggregates (Lindner et al., 2008). However, fundamental aspects of recombinant IB formation and IB characteristics remain either unknown or ambiguously discussed in literature due to the complexity of heterologous protein production and the mechanisms involved (Baneyx, 1999;Carri\u00f3 & Villaverde, 2003, 2005). Moreover, the type of expression system as well as the age of the culture have major influences on protein aggregate formation (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004). Combining these factors with a decreasing production rate for ageing cells may lead to various different IB agglomerates (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004;Lindner et al., 2008). Lee and Hsu described IB formation as a three step-reaction: partially misfolded peptide chains fuse to so-called proto-aggregates, which then merge to spherical IBs (Lee & Hsu, 2018). The existence of rod-and spherical-shaped protein aggregates has been postulated, but an explanation of distinct IB morphologies is still missing in literature (Bowden et al., 1991;Carri\u00f3 et al., 2000;Humer & Spadiut, 2018).",

The solubility of proteins expressed in bacteria under mass-production conditions is of major concern, since many recombinant polypeptides produced in bacteria accumulate as insoluble, often refractile, aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) [49], excluding many biotechnologically relevant protein species from the market due to economically inconvenient yields. To date, the solubility of a given gene product has not been anticipated before gene expression. The comparison between the AGGRESCAN output values for proteins shown to be soluble under overexpression condi-tions in E. coli and those forming inclusion bodies shows that they share a similar number of HSs per 100 residues (NnHS), an expected output when considering that most proteins in both datasets are globular. However, IB-forming proteins have higher Na 4 vSS values than soluble proteins, suggesting that soluble proteins have, on average, a lower intrinsic aggregation tendency than IB-forming species, which may determine, at least partially, their relative behaviour upon overexpression. Overall, the predicted aggregation of proteins in the SCOP database is intermediate between that of soluble and insoluble proteins, suggesting that, in agreement with experimental observations, only a part of them would remain in the soluble cell fraction upon recombinant production. \n\nAlthough AGGRESCAN is able to catch the average trends in the aggregation of IBs and soluble protein groups, the individual outputs for proteins from both groups overlap significantly, making the prediction of the recombinant behaviour of a given sequence difficult in its present form. Besides, aggregation during recombinant production is the net result of several extrinsic and intrinsic factors, their relative importance depending on the protein and expression contexts.",

Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within the producing bacteria. We evaluated how the initial culture density, temperature and duration of the expression stage affect the production of some eukaryotic enzymes in E. coli.FindingsA high yield of active soluble proteins was obtained by combining early-log phase cultures and low temperatures for protein induction. When IPTG was added at OD600\u2009=\u20090.1 and cultures were maintained at 4\u00b0C for 48-72\u00a0h, the soluble protein yield was 3 fold higher than that obtained in the mid-log phase (OD600\u2009=\u20090.6). Besides, the target protein expression increased and the endogenous bacterial proteins reduced, thus making the protein purification process easier and more efficient.ConclusionsThe protocol can be widely applied to proteins with a heterologous expression which was limited by loss of activity at high temperatures or by low soluble recombinant protein yield.",

The latter reacts by employing a heat-shock like response, which involves the induction of chaperones, foldases and proteases [10]. Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many recombinant proteins form inclusion bodies (IBs) which represent insoluble protein aggregates and necessitates elaborate downstream processing including de/re-naturation methods [8]. Recent work shows that IB-trapped proteins may actually be used directly [11], a result that contradicts the traditional thinking that IBs consist of misfolded, and thus inactive, protein. Still, in both cases further processing is needed to achieve soluble protein products [12]. On the other hand, the formation of inclusion bodies can also represent a favorable factor as the formation of such insoluble protein greatly facilitates initial protein enrichment. As such, the protein of interest as well as the purpose of the recombinant product will determine the desirable approach.\n\nThe goals of RPP are high protein yield and bioactivity, two variables that can have opposing dynamics. Despite notable advances (Table 1), the need for novel strategies that facilitate predictable and robust protein production processes is clearly present [13,14]. Most of the available expression platforms depend on either constitutive expression or fine-tuning of inducer concentrations, in order to adjust factors such as protein yield and solubility. For example, molecular chaperones and foldases are usually co-expressed from accessory plasmids with no further control [15]. However, imbalanced expression of these proteins can have detrimental effects on the production process. This leads to time-consuming fine-tuning, that is not robust to process modifications (e.g. a change in temperature or medium) as the optimal circuit operating point moves away from its previous value.\n\nIn order to address challenges such as balancing protein production and cellular stress, we developed a synthetic expression platform that enables the cell to shut down the RPP mechanism by itself, once stress signals are detected. For this implementation we used and created new standardized parts and developed a computational model to elucidate the dynamics of this protein expression system.

            "text": "Many mammalian proteins can be expressed at high levels in the prokaryotic host E. coli, but frequently accumulate in a misfolded and biologically inactive form in inclusion bodies [1]. Protein solubility can either be enhanced by modifying the production process, or by protein engineering. Most efforts have been directed to chemical denaturation of purified inclusion body proteins followed by refolding procedures. However, this strategy needs to be adapted to a particular protein species, and the yields of soluble protein can vary considerably. Attempts to prevent inclusion body formation and directly increase the solubility of recombinant proteins include expression of the protein of interest fused to a heterologous protein domain as a solubilizing agent [2]. Protein domains employed in this manner comprise glutathione-S-transferase (GST) from Schistosoma japonicum [3], thioredoxin [4], ubiquitin [5], protein A [6], DsbA [7], domain 1 of the translation initiation factor IF2 [8], and the maltosebinding protein (MBP) of E. coli [9,10]. \n\nMBP is part of a large class of proteins that aid in the uptake of small molecules [11]. While it naturally resides in the periplasm, MBP can also be expressed at high yields in the cytoplasm. For different proteins increased solubility, enhanced stability and markedly improved yields have been reported after fusion to MBP [12,13,14,15]. This has been explained by the ability of MBP to act as a chaperone in the context of a fusion protein, and promote the proper folding of the fusion partner [10,16,17]. Here we investigated the potential of MBP to improve as part of a fusion protein the expression of human granzyme B (GrB) as a secreted recombinant protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. \n\nThe serine protease GrB is normally released by cytotoxic lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is still one of the most commonly convenient production systems because of low cost, effi ciency, suitability for large-scale cultivation and easy manipulation (1). However, over-expression of the recombinant non-bacterial proteins in E. coli (higher than 2 % of cellular protein) led to misfolding or incomplete folding processes. These structures could be accumulated as insoluble aggregates found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli as so-called inclusion bodies (1)(2)(3). Although, the expression of protein as inclusion bodies has a high yield, the procedures for separation, washing and solubilization of inclusion bodies and native form of the recombinant heterologous protein are often time-consuming and diffi cult (4,5). The recent studies showed that a large part of proteins in inclusion bodies is functional and thus can be used for multiple applications without being solubilized and refolded (6). However, several strategies are available to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies such as manipulation of growth temperature, medium composition, dose of inducer, induction time, and plasmid-related properties including promoter, copy number and host strain. For some pro-teins, these strategies were ineffective to get a soluble product (7,8). As known, the green fl uorescent protein (GFP) could be used to generate fl uorescent fusion proteins. Most GFP fusion proteins were constructed by placing GFP at either N-or C-terminus of the host protein. These structures could damage the function of some host proteins. Another approach was tested to insert GFP into the middle of the host protein. However, fi nding a suitable site for insertion of GFP was problematic and time-consuming (9). Thus, the production of some GFP fusion proteins was often performed in eukaryotic expression systems such as insect or yeast (10,11). In this study, we attempted to generate a biologically active fl uorescent fusion protein in an E. coli system.",

            "text": "A bacterial expression host system, generally E. coli, is the preferable host for recombinant proteins due to its low cost, well-known biochemistry and genetics, rapid growth, and good productivity (Baeshen et al., 2015;Gupta and Shukla, 2016). Some disadvantages of this system include a lack of proper post-translational modifications (PTMs), inclusion body (IB) formation, codon bias, and endotoxin issues. Some techniques such as the addition of fusion tags (Liu M. et al., 2019) to the gene sequence, cofactor supplementation, and co-expression of the protein with molecular or chemical chaperones can avoid IB formation (Gupta S. K. et al., 2019) and improve soluble expression (Malekian et al., 2019). Different tags such as Fh8, SUMO, His, TRX, and MBP at the N-or Cterminal enhance protein solubility and also help in affinity purification (Paraskevopoulou and Falcone, 2018). Inducing protein expression by lowering the temperature after induction of culture leads to soluble protein. This strategy also increases protein stability and proper folding. Further, novel promoters and glycoengineering E. coli cells also lead to increased expression of a recombinant protein (Gupta and Shukla, 2016). However, the production of recombinant proteins in IBs has some advantages such as low product degradation by host cell proteases. Despite the various advantages of this system, a lack of PTM machinery results in a cumbersome purification process (Mamat et al., 2015). PTMs (glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, phosphorylation, or proteolytic processing) are involved in folding processes, stability, and biological activity (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). E. coli has been modified for PTM for the production of recombinant proteins. An E. coli host has also been engineered to produce glycosylated antibodies (Wacker et al., 2002;Valderrama-Rincon et al., 2012;Gupta and Shukla, 2016).",

            "text": "The formation of these aggregates seems to be independent of the type of protein, and this drawback has been proven difficult to overcome [18,19]. Nevertheless, the fact that inclusion bodies are easy to isolate and mainly composed by the over-expressed protein facilitates product recovery at industrial scale [20,21]. Thus, the production of recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies represent a cost-effective alternative for enzyme manufacturing, provided that efficient large scale refolding methods are available. This is the case for calf prochymosin, the precursor of chymosin, which is widely used in cheese making and mostly obtained from recombinant microorganisms [18,22]. \n\nIt has been recently shown that proteins contained in inclusion bodies possess a degree of secondary structure and exhibit biological activity in many cases [23][24][25][26][27][28]. Moreover, the quality of the inclusion bodies, determined by the degree of folding of the aggregated proteins, depends on different factors; many of them related to the translation rate of the corresponding mRNA [23,24]. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that synonymous codon replacement is not always silent [29]. Codon optimization affects translation rate which, in turn, may alter protein structure and function and thus the efficiency of refolding of proteins recovered from inclusion bodies [29][30][31]. Therefore, codon-optimized genes may lead to the formation of inclusion bodies from which the recovered proteins could be difficult to refold. \n\nIn this study, calf prochymosin was used as a model to perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the inclusion bodies obtained from the expression of a set of synthetic genes encoding this protein. Seven genes were designed and synthesized using two different codon optimization strategies, and the amount of recombinant protein and the refolding yield of the inclusion bodies obtained with each gene were compared.",

However, hampered protein targeting, translocation and folding as well as protein instability can all negatively affect periplasmic protein production yields. Strategies to enhance periplasmic protein production yields have focused on harmonizing secretory recombinant protein production rates with the capacity of the secretory apparatus by transcriptional and translational tuning, signal peptide selection and engineering, increasing the targeting, translocation and periplasmic folding capacity of the production host, preventing proteolysis, and, finally, the natural and engineered adaptation of the production host to periplasmic protein production. Here, we discuss these strategies using notable examples as a thread.",

New approaches towards usage as biocatalysts and as nanoparticulate matter are emerging as a result of discovering protein activity in inclusion bodies (IBs). These developments make the production of active IBs and the adjustment of their physicalmechanical properties in the upstream even more important. In the last decade, the term of non-classical IBs (ncIBs)-IBs with residual protein activity-was widely used in literature (Garc\u00eda-Fruit\u00f3s 2010). However, based on many studies in the recent years, it got clear that there is no distinct borderline between classical and nonclassical IBs anymore. Different approaches during strain development and especially cultivation make it possible to adapt protein activity and other quality attributes in the respective IB to a certain extent. In this review, we want to focus on the impact of upstream process parameters on different quality attributes (QAs) of IBs. Different IB producing concepts are presented in the beginning and the used analytics is compared. Following topics are therefore addressed: (i) an overview of the range of inclusion body applications; (ii) analytical methods to determine quality attributes and to sum the topic up; (iii) screws in process engineering to achieve the desired quality attributes for different inclusion body-based applications.",

            "text": "of foreign heterologous proteins were expressed at relatively low levels [7] or difficult to solubilize [8], in E. coli. These over-expressed proteins in an insoluble form are termed as inclusion bodies. Since the refolding procedure of inclusion bodies to recover a soluble form of recombinant proteins is time-consuming, expression of insoluble protein aggregates is frequently a major obstacle in recombinant protein production.\n\nHence, to meet the demands of preventing inclusion body formation in recombinant expression systems, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to optimize the growth conditions, such as buffer composition, protein concentration, and cultivation temperature. While others have focused on improving the folding probabilities regarding enhancement of mRNA stability, over-expression of rare-codon tRNA, selection of efficient vectors and host strains, and co-expression with solubility-enhanced proteins [3]. Nevertheless, more studies have emphasized the importance of increasing the solubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli by fusing them to highly soluble carrier proteins [9][10][11][12]. Because the only way to select a specific match between a target protein and an appropriate fusion partner that will lead to a soluble form is still a trial-anderror process; a more systematic approach is required.\n\nRegardless of fusing different vectors, most previous works have attempted to predict the propensity of a given protein to be soluble or not in E. coli. The first such study was conducted by Wilkinson and Harrison [13] with a regression model analysis. They concluded five amino acid-dependent factors are discriminative features that correlate to inclusion bodies formation. There were charge average approximation (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg), turn-forming residue fraction (Asn, Gly, Pro and Ser), cysteine and proline fractions, hydrophilicity and molecular weight. In a subsequent study, Davis et al. have improved the statistical solubility model of solubility in E. coli by demonstrating that the first two parameters were more critical than other three [14]. Additionally, based on the undertaking of structural genomics projects, Bertone et al. have applied machine learning techniques such as decision trees and Support",

            "text": "However, we infer that decreasing rather than increasing the activity is propitious to produce NAOS with high and various DPs. Therefore, NAOS with more diverse and higher DPs would be produced by the reformed \u03b2-agarase through truncation and/or other forms of amino-acid sequence modification in future works. The present study provides direction toward future NAOS production through enzyme modification. \n\nThe conditions for producing NAOS with various DPs were optimized in this study, which successfully resulted in NAOS with the highest SUR and yields. NAOS yield is always considered, whereas SUR is often neglected during production. SUR is greatly important for production because a low SUR results in the waste of substrate and labor cost and the loss of equipment. The SUR value of 92.5% can be reached after optimization. In addition, NAOS with various DPs are the intermediate products of most \u03b2-agarases and can be produced by many \u03b2-agarases theoretically if the reaction time is precisely controlled. Unfortunately, fully controlling the reaction time in the complex and extensive industrial production is unrealistic. In this study, NAOS with various DPs serve as the end-products under optimized conditions (Figure 2D), and these stable products make the reaction more flexible and easily controlled. In summary, the high SUR and yield of NAOS and the stable final products demonstrate that our method is a promising strategy for large-scale NAOS production. \n\nFurthermore, the expression level of trAgaM1 was optimized to provide sufficient enzymes for NAOS production. During E. coli expression, the formation of inclusion bodies usually causes the low productivity of recombinant proteins (Le et al., 2011;Jhamb and Sahoo, 2012). Lowering the induction temperature is the most common method to reduce the production of inclusion bodies. However, refrigeration would consume additional energy during fermentation. Supplementing natural osmolytes, the so-called chemical chaperones, into the fermentation medium is an alternative method to decrease the formation of inclusion bodies (Diamant et al., 2010).",

Chemical chaperones, usually osmolytes, help cells counter unfavorable physiological conditions by stabilizing the native folding state of proteins and destabilizing partially folded states and early aggregates [11]. Cyclodextrins have recently been shown to be efficient chemical chaperones, assisting protein refolding and suppressing the misfolding and aggregation of proteins both in vitro and in vivo [12,13]. \n\nIn the present study, cyclodextrin was employed for the first time as a chemical chaperone in the expression of recombinant \u03b3-CGTase in E. coli.

            "text": "E. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

However, the higher expression rates of recombinant proteins in E. coli are often accompanied with the formation of insoluble aggregates of the target protein called inclusion bodies (IBs) (Singh et al., 2015). The aim of this study was to express the recombinant IL-2 protein in considerable amounts that could be used as a positive control for early diagnosis of tumors and in cancer research in Egypt. Another aim was to investigate the effect of different expression conditions on the solubility behavior of eukaryotic protein expression in E. coli using human IL-2 as a model protein.",

            "text": "After protein concentration determination 50 ng/ml of purified \u03b2-NGF was added to PC12 cell line. Commercial \u03b2-NGF (Sigma-USA) was used as control too. As shown in Fig. 4, after 7 days PC12 cells were differentiated to the nerve cells. This indicated that the purified \u03b2-NGF could be fully functional. High level expression and production of recombinant proteins is the goal of many researches. However, this usually leads to the formation of aggregated and misfolded proteins called inclusion body. One of the best strategies to overcome this problem is to use fusion proteins, e. g. DsbA, as used in this research. DsbA is an enzyme that can assist disulfide bond formation in nascent polypeptide chains (Ke & Berkmen, 2014). \n\nAnother strategy for the prevention of inclusion body formation is the co-expression of molecular chaperones. As molecular chaperones are involved in the protein-folding process, their over-expression was usually carried out in order to increase the stability and solubility of the produced target recombinant protein (De Marco et al., 2007;Tegel et al., 2011;Makhoba et al., 2015;Gounel et al., 2016). E. coli cytoplasm involves three chaperone systems: trigger factor, DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES (Voziyan et al., 1998;Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004). Newly-synthesized proteins in bacteria are associated with the chaperone trigger factor as soon as they leave the exit tunnel of the ribosome (Deuerling et al., 1999;Valent et al., 1997;Schaffitzel et al., 2001). The effects of different chaperone teams on protein solubility and folding have been studied in recent researches. For example, in one experiment done by Sia and colleagus, GroEL team and TF increased the production of soluble human-like collagen (HLC) by assisting its correct folding (Jia et al., 2014).",

For example, since high protein expression leads to lower protein quality and to highly stressed cells, molecular chaperones and foldases are usually co-expressed from accessory plasmids with no further control. 5 Too much or too little expression of these proteins results in drastically decreased recombinant protein quality and yield. This leads to time-consuming fine-tuning, that is not robust to process modifications (e.g., a change in temperature, medium or target protein) that may shift the optimal operating point. In addition, control of the protein production available systems may have either low inducibility or leaky expression, which is non-optimal in the case that the recombinant product is toxic to the host cells. Toxicity of the inducer (e.g., IPTG) also limits these systems from being used for therapeutic products, 8 while the need for a constant induction at high cell densities considerably adds to costs in large scale production processes. For these reasons a pH inducible system 9 and more recently a temperature-inducible system have been proposed, 10 but both these systems rely on variable environmental parameters and as such are limited to a narrow range of",

Escherichia coli, by far, is regarded as one of the convenient hosts for the recombinant production of therapeutically important and commercially relevant proteins [1][2][3]. However, overexpression of many recombinant proteins in this host leads to the accumulation of desired product in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs), which are biologically inactive. Whereas the additional steps required in the recovery of bioactive protein from the IBs result in an overall low yield, the presence of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) in the outer membrane of E. coli further complicates the purification scheme and hence limits the usefulness of this system ( [4][5][6][7] and references therein). \n\nTargeting expression of heterologous proteins in the culture medium may be an attractive choice as it may reduce the downstream processing cost [8]. In this regard, Grampositive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which directly exports proteins into the extracellular medium, may be exploited well [6,9]. B. subtilis, owing to its naturally high secretory ability, provides better folding conditions and thus prevents formation of IBs as opposed to the E. coli based expression systems [10,11]. Its Sec-dependent secretary pathway is involved in the formation of secretory preproteins complex with the chaperons that bind to the secretory translocase and help in translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. The protein is released from translocase after removal of signal peptide, refolded, and crosses the cell wall [8,10,12,13]. Low protein yield, abundant secretion of proteases, and plasmid instability, however, are some bottlenecks which may sometime limit the application potential of B. subtilis ([9] and references therein). \n\nNeutropenia, that is, decreased count of neutrophils, is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation.",

However, the E. coli expression system has various shortcomings. One major problem is that target proteins often form incorrect aggregations or insoluble inclusion bodies [2]. Inclusion bodies are complex and their mechanisms of formation remain debated. Recently, it was discovered that inclusion bodies are rich in \u03b2-sheets and can be combined with amyloidtropic dyes, suggesting that they are related to the formation of amyloids [3,4]. \n\nTo date, researchers have used fusion tags on protein expression to facilitate soluble expression of recombinant proteins, and a variety of tags have been developed including Spy [5], Flag [6], GST [7], Trx [8], Sumo [9], NusA [10], and MBP [11]. Although numerous commercial tags exist, many proteins are still too insoluble for use. Therefore, more efficient solubilizing fusion tags are necessary, which was the goal of our research.",

            "text": "Temperature is a crucial factor that affects cell growth and protein production [14]. This factor also affects the substrate consumption rate, the quality of the product, and process duration. Since the culture medium temperature increases the rate of protein synthesis, it may not provide enough time for the correct protein folding [4,15]. Many attempts have been made to improve folding and solubility during the expression. One of the most commonly used strategies is changing bacterial growth conditions [7]. Although the temperature drop to less than 37 \u2022 C in E. coli causes a reduction in specific growth rates [16]. We investigated the effect of various temperatures on the yield of extracellular production of nanobody and cell biomass. Generally, low temperature leads to slower cell growth and protein expression. Decreased cell growth resulted in reduced consumption of carbon source and increased dissolved oxygen, which results in decreased acetate [16,17]. SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 6) revealed that glycine in autoinduction medium could effectively promote the release of recombinant nanobody, possibly due to its impact on fatty acids leading to increased cell membrane fluidity and permeability [1,6,18]. The expression of recombinant protein in the form of soluble and biologically active are advantages in comparison to the inclusion body (insoluble form) as the various steps, including refolding, could be avoided in downstream processing. In this study, the conventional induction (IPTG inducer) which produced insoluble recombinant protein in E. coli is compared with the autoinduction strategy for soluble expression of nanobody. Based on previous reports, the maximum amount of extracellular production occurred at the lower concentration of glucose and at the higher concentration of glycerol [7,11,19]. The high concentration of glucose in the medium causes catabolic repression and also the production of byproducts such as acetate [20]. Moreover, this causes the increase of acidity of the medium and reduction of target protein production [2]. In contrast to the results obtained for glucose, glycerol has a positive impact on target protein production.",

In this follow-up study, we investigated the impact of common technical failures during recombinant production of two soluble, model proteins (GFP and P2Ox) on cell physiology, productivity and final protein quality. Our methodology also proved to be an interesting approach to investigate the process and product robustness. Compared to our previous results on IB production [3], our current results show that soluble protein production is less robust to temporary environmental changes. Importantly, we found that technical failures, especially those that introduce limited oxygen supply, significantly  affect cell physiology, productivity, protein quality and, therefore, also final process and product robustness.",

The yield increases as the IPTG concentration and induction growth time are increased, reaching a maximum at 0.4 mM IPTG and 3.5 h post-induction growth (data not shown). When IPTG concentration is increased to 1 mM, no further increase in expression yield is observed. When cells are grown for more than 3.5 h, the total yield decreases and degradative products increase, as determined by Western blotting using anti-QPs3 peptide antibodies. \n\nThe yield of recombinant GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coli is increased by using an induction growth medium containing magnesium. When LB or peptone phosphate-enriched medium was used, production of GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coli accounts for less than 1% total cellular protein. However, including 5 mM magnesium in the enriched medium or using SOC medium increases the yield of GST-QPs3 fusion protein to about 15% total cellular protein (see Table I). Although the yield of fusion protein in E. coli is slightly higher with enriched medium supplemented with magnesium than with the SOC medium, the latter is preferred because severe degradation of the fusion protein is observed with the former. \n\nAlthough the expression level for GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coli is high using SOC medium at 37 \u00b0C, about 90% expressed protein is in the inclusion body precipitate. Purification of fusion protein from inclusion bodies is not practical, at least in our hands, because the recovery of soluble, active GST-QPs3 from dialyzed, urea-solubilized inclusion body is very low (less than 1%).",

            "text": "This system was transferred to E. coli [60] and the production of glycosylated proteins at a scale of 5 L was made possible [61]. There are still several significant challenges to be overcome in the production of glycosylated proteins in E. coli. Not only sometimes glycosylation is incomplete, but also its efficiency can be very low and heterogeneity can be found if more than one glycosylation site is present. Additionally, the production of glycosylated proteins was shown to negatively affect cell growth [4]. Since most of the eukaryotic proteins are Nterminally acetylated, this modification is very important in recombinant protein production in prokaryotic systems as acetylation has shown to affect several cellular processes. Also, phosphorylation is very important for the activity of many recombinant proteins and it was shown that either by co-expressing chaperone proteins or by performing gene fusions, it was possible to obtain some acetylated and phosphorylated proteins in E. coli [4]. \n\nOther drawbacks are the possibility of acetate accumulation, which has a toxic effect, although this can be controlled by the oxygen level and careful choice of the expression strain. Additionally, many proteins are produced as insoluble inclusion bodies, which are inactive and require refolding. \n\nAlthough it has been argued that recombinant protein production in inclusion bodies decreases the deleterious effects associated with protein toxicity (as the protein is not active), it must be remembered that high-level recombinant protein production is always toxic to the cells due to the metabolic burden associated with the expenditure of energy, amino acids and other precursor molecules. In order to obtain an active protein from these inclusion bodies, it is often necessary to remove them from the cells, the proteins must be solubilized by denaturants that cause protein unfolding, and disulfide bonds must be broken using reducing agents. Refolding than proceeds by removing the denaturant and reducing agent followed by renaturation with oxidation agents [5].",

            "text": "BackgroundAcetylation of lysine residues is a reversible post-translational modification conserved from bacteria to humans. Several recent studies have revealed hundreds of lysine-acetylated proteins in various bacteria; however, the physiological role of these modifications remains largely unknown. Since lysine acetylation changes the size and charge of proteins and thereby may affect their conformation, we assumed that lysine acetylation can stimulate aggregation of proteins, especially for overproduced recombinant proteins that form inclusion bodies.ResultsTo verify this assumption, we used Escherichia coli strains that overproduce aggregation-prone VP1GFP protein. We found that in \u0394ackA-pta cells, which display diminished protein acetylation, inclusion bodies were formed with a delay and processed faster than in the wild-type cells. Moreover, in \u0394ackA-pta cells, inclusion bodies exhibited significantly increased specific GFP fluorescence. In CobB deacetylase-deficient cells, in which protein acetylation was enhanced, the formation of inclusion bodies was increased and their processing was significantly inhibited. Similar results were obtained with regard to endogenous protein aggregates formed during the late stationary phase in \u0394ackA-pta and \u0394cobB cells.ConclusionsOur studies revealed that protein acetylation affected the aggregation of endogenous E. coli proteins and the yield, solubility, and biological activity of a model recombinant protein. In general, decreased lysine acetylation inhibited the formation of protein aggregates, whereas increased lysine acetylation stabilized protein aggregates. These findings should be considered during the designing of efficient strategies for the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli cells.",

            "text": "However, the periplasmic expression of recombinant proteins has two major drawbacks of low yield and frequent aggregation. Alternatively, the production of domain antibodies using fusion constructs in tandem with a stretch of amino acid (peptide tag) or a large polypeptide (Thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and maltose-binding protein (MBP) has been demonstrated in bacterial periplasmic and cytoplasmic systems [8]. Unfortunately, the reducing environment in the cytoplasmic region remains a limiting factor for the folding of the majority of cysteine rich proteins such as antibodies. An approach to overcome the shortcoming is to express the antibodies in the cytoplasm of mutant E. coli strains that provide an oxidizing environment. However, often, the formation of a partially folded/misfolded protein is triggered, which is forced to aggregate as non-functional inclusion bodies (IBs) [9]. Largely, cysteine-rich proteins are formed as IBs in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartments of E. coli [10]. Utilizing various strategies for molecular and protein engineering such as gene fusion technology, co-production of chaperones [11], use of engineered host E.coli strains [12], optimizing the growth conditions such as temperature, inducer concentration, and induction time, can often help in increasing the formation of efficient soluble protein production [13]. \n\nRecently, it has been reported that recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the soluble form in the bacterial expression system by adding compatible solutes (chemical additives) such as sorbitol, arginine, and trehalose in the expression medium [14]. Although proteins with disulfide bonds are also found in the cytoplasmic region of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, most of them are transient and involve cysteines located in redox-active sites of enzymes [15]. Both classical and non-classical IBs contain relatively pure and intact recombinant proteins, and several approaches have been reported to recover biologically active proteins from these aggregated forms.",

            "text": "coli) had been intentionally chosen for production of BmSXP recombinant protein based on two reasons. First, carbohydrate moieties on helminth antigens has been reported to contribute to serological cross-reactions (Yamano et al., 2009), thus an E. coli system is used because the proteins expressed do not have post translational modifications. Second, an E. coli expression system allows production of large amounts of recombinant proteins (Kathleen et al., 1996). However, synthesis of recombinant protein places substantial metabolic burden on the producing cells. In order to prevent this burden from compromising the growth, biomass production and protein production are separated by using transcription regulators. Common regulators used in E. coli include the lac, trp, araBAD and tac promoters (Makrides, 1996). The lac promoter used in this work is controlled by the use of isopropyl-\u00df-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) (Kweon et al., 2001). Recombinant protein production is normally induced in the late exponential growth phase. However, induction in the late exponential phase or early stationary phase reduces the culture viability and can lead to production of proteases that can break down the desired recombinant protein. On the other hand, early induction can unnecessarily slow the doubling time of bacterial cells (Chisti, 1998;Corchero et al., 2001). Hence it is important to optimize the type of medium, IPTG concentration and induction time, to achieve high cell density culture towards the aim of producing a high yield of the recombinant protein. \n\nGenerally the development of fermentation strategies are focused on improving the cultivation techniques, manipulating the physiology of the bacteria and the level of recombinant protein expression.. As a result, batch and fed batch fermentation techniques have been developed (Shiloach and Fass, 2005).",

            "text": "The E. coli extract-based cell-free expression system is the most popular, and it has significantly improved during the last few years. Two main advantages of this system are that there is no need to support cellular metabolism and that the reaction environment can be controlled, making it possible to add any necessary component into the reaction mixture to reach the optima protein production conditions. \n\nThe aggregation of recombinant proteins in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs) is also a major issue associated with recombinant production processes. Some proteins show a low solubility and are mainly produced in their aggregated version. In consequence, many solubilization strategies and a wide number of refolding parameters have been described for the isolation of soluble proteins from IBs [21]. Due to the extent of IB characterization in the last two decades, showing that IBs are protein aggregates formed (at least partially) by correctly folded and fully active recombinant proteins [22], non-denaturing solubilization protocols have been recently developed [23,24]. \n\nFinally, emerging tools are also being used to optimize the expression of recombinant proteins. The use of high-throughput technologies allows the reshaping and optimization of traditional production processes in a fast and efficient way. This includes cultivation platforms, detection methods, and screening systems [25]. In addition, the use of synthetic biology to design and build genome-reduced bacteria is an interesting technology to design bacteria with a minimal genome removing the unnecessary proportions of genome which can improve cellular capacity, and, consequently, increase heterologous protein expression [26].",

            "text": "that none of the constructs led to significant accumulation of the fusion protein in a soluble form. Despite the accumulated evidence indicating that MBP is a very promising solubility-enhancing partner [39][40][41], no affinity tag is universally ideal and many have the same downside of yielding different performances with different partner proteins [43,44]. Fusing an insoluble protein to a solubility-enhancing partner does not guarantee a soluble fusion protein [39].\n\nThere are multiple factors that contribute towards the formation of protein aggregates during heterologous expression in E. coli. Under normal circumstances, one protein chain is released from the ribosome of E.coli every 35 s and the macromolecule concentration can reach 300-400 mg ml \u00c01. Under these conditions the correct folding of a protein can be considered an extraordinary event [45]. In addition, the newly synthesized recombinant protein is being synthesized in an environment that may be quite different from that of its original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, co-factors and folding mechanisms [46]. Finally, it may also be the case that insolubility is an intrinsic property of a particular protein [41]. Either way, if a given protein fails to rapidly achieve its native conformation there are two possible consequences: partial or complete deposition into inclusion bodies [45]. Tight control of a variety of parameters, including temperature of expression, expression rate and inducer concentration, might help to reduce the formation of aggregates [37,43]. In many cases, the overexpression of genes in E.coli remains an unsolved  problem as the proteins continue to be synthesized as inclusion bodies.\n\nConsidering the impossibility of produci both fusion proteins in a soluble form, even with the MBP in the construction as a solubility-enhancing tag, the next step was to solubilize and re-fold the inclusion bodies, as described in Methods. The solubilized peptide-fusion proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4) and the results obtained revealed that, despite both His 6 MBPBladSP-10 and His 6 MBPBladSub5 being synthesized as inclusion bodies and thus only soluble in denaturant buffer",

            "text": "Advancements in inclusion body resolubilization and protein refolding have led to a better understanding of the forces governing inclusion body formation and of methods used to efficiently refold proteins of interest [14,15]. To generate a sufficient amount of purified protein from inclusion bodies it is necessary to isolate the inclusion bodies from the E. coli lysate, solubilize the inclusion bodies and then refold the protein of interest [12]. The first two steps are relatively straightforward often requiring mechanical disruption (e.g. French Press or sonication) and centrifugation to lyse the E. coli and isolate the inclusion bodies followed by the addition generally of chaotropic agents (e.g. GuHCl or Urea) to solubilize them. It is the refolding of the protein of interest that is often the limiting step with aggregation and improper disulphide bond formation being two major issues to overcome. During protein refolding, aggregation of partially folded intermediates can result in a significant decrease in final yields. L-arginine, a natural amino acid, is commonly used to enhance protein refolding by suppressing protein aggregation [16,17]. To aid in proper disulphide bond formation, the inclusion bodies are first solubilized in a solution containing a reducing agent such as DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol. These are used to disrupt any non-native disulphide bonds and must be removed, often by dialysis, before proper disulphide bond formation can proceed in the refolding process. During refolding, a combination of reduced and oxidized thiols (e.g. glutathione), are used to promote disulphide exchange [12]. It is thought that this is most effective when the protein is forming its secondary and tertiary structure so that the cysteinyl residues are in the correct proximity to each other [18]. \n\nWe describe in detail here a straightforward method to refold and purify rhGM-CSF from inclusion bodies that generates milligram amounts of active protein from a single litre of E. coli.",

            "text": "One of the greatest drawbacks to obtain high recombinant protein yields with E. coli is the formation of inclusion bodies and protein precipitation, due to high expression, incorrect folding, aggregation, or low chaperone activity (Gopal and Kumar, 2013). Recombinant protein precipitation involves, in addition to a decrease in the yield of the production process, an alteration in the gene transcription of the strain (Baig et al., 2014). Hence, to optimize a large-scale recombinant protein production process, it is essential to know what proportion of the protein forms precipitates and what fraction remains in soluble form, and therefore functional for most subsequent applications. In order to know the percentage of soluble and insoluble YFP protein, batch cultures were carried out with E. coli growing under the conditions corresponding to the maximum expression observed for each vector (Figure 5). When cultures reached the stationary phase, soluble/insoluble fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometric analysis. Electrophoresis gels are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Figure 5 results showed that insoluble YFP protein was present in all cultures. However, cultures where YFP was expressed under P BAD promoter control showed lower insoluble fraction. Moreover, cultures containing pSF-p15A-trc-YFP and pSF-p15A-tac-YFP vectors, of which YFP expression was the highest, showed a similar percentage of soluble and insoluble protein. This difference observed in the amount of protein precipitated according to the expression plasmid used is very relevant, since it is useless to achieve a high expression if most of the protein is precipitated together with the cell pellet. Therefore, this aspect should be studied previously when selecting an expression system, especially if we are faced with a protein with limited solubility.",

The foremost aim in improving protein refolding from E. coli produced inclusion bodies is to increase both the allowed protein concentrations during the refolding process and the final refolding yield. Recent advances in this area are summarized in conjunction with a short overview on inclusion body isolation and solubilization procedures.

Cells, transformed with pET recombinant plasmids, were grown in 10 mL of Terrific Broth medium (TB) containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin, at 37\u00b0C up to OD 600nm of 2. These cultures were used to inoculate 1 L of TB/ampicillin medium. Glucose at final concentration of 4 g/L was added to cultures to limit protein expression before induction with IPTG. TB medium was found to be able to induce protein expression over the early growth phase reducing the final optical density of cultures and therefore the recombinant protein yield [48]. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C up to OD 600nm of 3.5-4. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by addition of IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside) at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Cells were harvested after overnight induction by centrifugation at 8000x g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and sonicated in a cell disruptor (10 x 1 min cycle, on ice). The suspension was then centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The insoluble fractions containing the recombinant protein as inclusion bodies, were washed three times in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100 and 2 M urea, followed by repeated washes in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, to eliminate traces of Triton, urea and EDTA.

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein . Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to maximize the efficient production of soluble recombinant proteins in bacteria. A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co-expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in E. coli, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 5.24.1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein.

            "text": "The optimization of some growth parameters, like the use of low growth temperatures and non-saturating amounts of expression inducer as well as the over-expression of chaperones by means of short heat shock, ethanol stress or recombinant co-expression [8,9], has often improved the yields of recombinant soluble proteins. Nevertheless, in most of the cases part or all of the recombinant protein expressed in bacteria is recovered as precipitates in the inclusion bodies. \n\nBoth amorphous and organized inclusion bodies have been isolated [10]. Their composition varies from almost homogeneous to cases in which 50% of the material is represented by contaminants [11,12]. The structural het-erogeneity of the inclusion bodies has recently been shown [13,14] and it could be a consequence of the variable aggregation pattern to which a single protein can undergo under different conditions [15]. Proteins trapped in the inclusion bodies can be re-solubilised in vivo by impairing the de novo protein synthesis because the block of new protein production makes available larger amounts of chaperones and foldases for refolding precipitated proteins [3]. The temporal separation between recombinant expression of chaperones and target proteins has also been successfully used to improve the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [8]. These results suggest a model for which soluble proteins are in a dynamic equilibrium with aggregates. In conclusion, modifications of the cell conditions can modulate the aggregation rate and the protein aggregation process can be reversed by conditions favorable for the folding machinery. This dynamic view for which proteins can pass from soluble to insoluble and back to soluble state suggests the presence of different degrees of aggregation complexity. Soluble aggregates of recombinant proteins have been described [16,17] and in a recent paper we have shown that the GFP-GST fusion protein expressed in bacteria forms aggregates with an estimated mass ranging from a few hundred kDa to more than 1000 kDa [18]. The separation of the aggregates using a blue native gel electrophoresis followed by SDS-PAGE indicated an almost continuous distribution with few regions of concentrated accumulation.",

However, its nature to form inclusion bodies during the process becomes a challenge, since inclusion bodies are mostly biologically inactive. Solubilizing the insoluble inclusion bodies and further refolding processes are required to obtain an active protein. The method for protein refolding is vary, such as dilution, dialysis, chromatography-based method, usage of immobilization folding catalyst, and artificial chaperones, and also enzyme-assisted refolding is among the available methods which offer different and unique advantages and disadvantages. Chemical additives also play role to improve the refolding process. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield, while oxo-shuffling agents such as GSH/GSSG, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT sometimes used to promote disulfide shuffling to obtain proper disulfide bridge pairs. Monitoring the refolding process was conducted by characterizing the protein structure. However, performing a rapid and accurate characterization sometimes become a challenge, in fact, both criteria are occasionally exchanging each other. Therefore, in this review, we briefly discussed protein refolding along with its structural characterization method.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most common production hosts for recombinant proteins and many expression construct components are available to improve yields and facilitate protein recovery, including a variety of promoters and fusion proteins (Moore et al., 2016;Schreiber et al., 2017). Although, many recombinant proteins are strongly expressed with short production times and can be recovered as soluble products, others are difficult to express either because they are toxic to the host, resulting in low yields, or because they form insoluble inclusion bodies due to incomplete or incorrect folding (Carri\u00f3 and Villaverde, 2002;Sa\u00efda, 2007). These challenges are often encountered when expressing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), many of which require the formation of disulfide bonds for efficient folding and biological activity. In some cases inclusion bodies are produced deliberately, but the purification and refolding of insoluble proteins requires elaborate downstream processing and often limits the yield and functionality of the product (Hoffmann et al., 2018). \n\nThe folding of recombinant proteins in bacteria can also be improved by targeting the periplasm, a space between the outer and inner membrane that contains more chaperones than the cytoplasm, thus promoting folding and resulting in higher yields and less complex downstream processing steps. The oxidizing environment of the periplasm also favors the formation of disulfide bonds (Choi and Lee, 2004;Balasundaram et al., 2009). Translocation of proteins to the periplasm has been a subject to research since the very beginnings of recombinant protein expression technology (Gray et al., 1985;Oliveira et al., 1999). There are two major protein secretion pathways in bacteria. The general secretory (Sec) pathway exports unfolded proteins during or after translation (Tsirigotaki et al., 2017) whereas the twinarginine translocation (Tat) pathway exports folded proteins. Secretion to the periplasm is achieved by adding an N-terminal signal peptide, which is cleaved off during translocation (Berks et al., 2000).",

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that enabling proper disulphide bond formation through the use of reduced and oxidized thiols and the addition of L-arginine to prevent aggregation are key to improving yields of purified, active protein [18,24]. An alternative approach to producing rhGM-CSF is to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies in the first place. Expression systems that allow for the recovery of soluble and purified rhGM-CSF from the periplasmic space of E. coli have been successful, although the final yields can be significantly lower (,500 mg/ml) [25]. Alternatively, expression of proteins of interest as fusion proteins has been shown to aid in the production of soluble, active protein if the target is normally susceptible to inclusion body formation [26]. rhGM-CSF has successfully been fused to either Thioredoxin (TRX) or an intein resulting in the production of high yields of purified rhGM-CSF [27,28].

            "text": "BackgroundEscherichia coli has been most widely used for the production of valuable recombinant proteins. However, over-production of heterologous proteins in E. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO).ResultsWe have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191\u2013345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively.ConclusionThe refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.",

            "text": "Since the inception of recombinant DNA technology, Escherichia coli has been most widely used as a host to produce recombinant proteins whose bioactivity is not dependent on posttranslational modifications. Almost 80% of overexpressed recombinant proteins in E. coli result in the formation of protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) (J\u00fcrgen et al., 2010). IBs, in general, are highly dense particles having low aqueous solubility. Solubilization of the inclusion body proteins and refolding of the solubilized protein are the major determining steps for the efficient recovery of bioactive proteins (Singh and Panda, 2005). \n\nConventional methods for inclusion body solubilization involve the usage of a high concentration of denaturing agents such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride along with a reducing agent (Fischer et al., 1993;Rudolph and Lilie, 1996). Although these methods solubilize almost all of the (IBs), the recovery of bioactive protein is very low due to the formation of aggregates during refolding (Datar et al., 1993;Panda, 2003). Concomitantly, the presence of a native-like secondary structure of the protein trapped and the confirmation of biological activity in IBs led to the development of several mild solubilization buffers in the past two decades (Ventura and Villaverde, 2006;Singhvi et al., 2020). Mild denaturing buffers are strong enough to solubilize bacterial (IBs) but mild enough to protect the existing nativelike secondary structure of the protein in IBs. These buffers are based on alkaline and acidic pH, high hydrostatic pressure, organic solvents, and freeze-thaw in the presence of a low concentration of chaotrope. In the past two decades, the buffers have consistently demonstrated improved recovery of bioactive protein from bacterial (IBs) (Singh et al., 2015). \n\nOut of several mild solubilization methods developed in the past, the recently developed freeze-thaw-based inclusion body protein solubilization method has received a great deal of attention due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.",

            "text": "Recombinant production of high disulfide bond-rich proteins is challenging by the use of microbial hosts, as it results in the formation of inclusion bodies [31]. Morphologically, inclusion bodies are dense, amorphous protein deposits that can be found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic regions of bacteria [32]. The right refolding processes of inclusion body refolding processes are poised to play a major role in the production of recombinant proteins. Protein refolding is the process by which an unstructured protein alters its conformation to reach its native structure. Hence, the renaturation of these inclusion body proteins is a field of increasing interest in gaining large amounts of correctly folded proteins. \n\nImproving biologically active renatured protein yields by minimizing aggregation and cost-effectiveness involves improvement in the process of inclusion body isolation, washing, solubilization of the aggregated protein, and actual refolding. While the efficiency of the washing and solubilization steps can be relatively high, refolding protein yields may be limited by the accumulation of inactive misfolded as well as aggregated protein [33]. Because the majority of cysteine-rich proteins including antibodies contains one or more disulfide bonds, refolding with concomitant disulfide-bond formation is challenging in a bacteria host [34]. Bacterial cells containing inclusion bodies are usually disrupted by high-pressure homogenization or a combination of mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods [35]. The resulting suspension is treated by either low-speed centrifugation or filtration to remove soluble proteins from the particulate containing the inclusion bodies. To date, no information was provided about the efficiency of IBs solubilization process or the range of inclusion body protein. \n\nThe most commonly used solubilizing agents are denaturants, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and urea (6-8 M), and protein concentrations of 1-10 mg/mL during the solubilization step [36].",

            "text": "In agreement with previous studies, we confirmed significant accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates as inclusion bodies upon high-level expression of hGH in E. coli (Figure 1). We observed that most of the hGH was found in the insoluble fraction (lane P; pellet fraction), and there was a very small amount of soluble hGH (lane S; soluble fraction). To increase the yield of soluble protein, the protein expression conditions can be optimized by varying induction temperatures, inducer concentrations and media compositions [21]. In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins [22]. Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies. We observed efficient expression of hGH with a 5-fold increase in solubility upon induction at 16uC for 16 h (Figure 1B), and thus those conditions were used in subsequent experiments. We also determined whether the formation of inclusion bodies could be reduced by lowering IPTG concentration (to 0.1 mM). The results indicate that reducing IPTG concentration is not as effective as lowering induction temperature at preventing the formation of inclusion bodies under our conditions (Figure S1). \n\nAs a substantial amount of hGH was still found in the insoluble fraction, we examined whether the pelleted hGH could be recovered by optimizing protein extraction. Although the formation of inclusion bodies may be further reduced by optimizing environmental factors such as culture media [21] or genetic engineering [23,24], we reasoned that the observed protein aggregation may involve some other factors such as non-specific protein interactions. To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented [25]. We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure. As shown in Figure 2A, the use of Triton X-100 significantly increased the solubility of hGH expressed at low temperature.",

            "text": "However, overexpression of protein in E. coli results in inclusion bodies due to misfolding and aggregation of the protein [17][18][19][20][21]. In general, inclusion bodies need to be solubilized using high concentrations of denaturants such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride, and refolded by the removal of denaturants. In many cases, however, the overall yield of biologically active protein from inclusion bodies is low [22]. To improve the solubility of hGH in E. coli, several strategies have been attempted, including periplasmic secretion [23,24], low expression temperature [25], and low isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) concentration [26]. These methods all successfully improve the solubility of hGH. However, even with these methods, the final yield of secreted pelB-and ompA-hGH into periplasmic only approximately 1.4 mg/L. In addition, the study of slowing the protein synthesis rate by regulating the IPTG concentration did not provide detailed information about purification [26]. During the preparation of this manuscript, maltose-binding protein (MBP) was reported as a fusion partner for soluble expression of tandem dimer of thrombopoietin mimetic peptide (dTMP) fused to hGH (dTMP-hGH) [27]. \n\nIn this study, seven N-terminal fusion tags, hexahistidine (His6), thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), MBP, Nutilization substance protein A (NusA), protein disulfide bond isomerase (PDI), and the b9a9 domain of PDI (PDIb9a9), were tested for the soluble overexpression of hGH in E. coli. Among these seven tags, MBP and PDI significantly increased the solubility at 37uC. Lowering the expression temperature to 18uC dramatically increased the solubility of all fusion proteins.",

Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. As inclusion bodies contain relatively pure and intact proteins, protein refolding is an important process to obtain active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, conventional refolding methods, such as dialysis and dilution, are time consuming and, often, recovered yields of active proteins are low, and a trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. Recently, several approaches have been reported to refold these aggregated proteins into an active form. The strategies largely aim at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This review focuses on protein refolding techniques using chemical additives and laminar flow in microfluidic chips for the efficient recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies.",

            "text": "The aim of recombinant protein production is to yield high amounts of the desired proteins. As a result the host organism is often forced to produce proteins above the cells physiological capacity. Upon over-expression, a high amount of proteins are constantly formed that cannot be simultaneously processed by the protein synthesis machinery, thus the quality control system is activated [25]. Additionally, E. coli has simple protein folding machinery, which lacks post-translational modifications. Due to the reducing potential of the E. coli cytoplasmic redox state, the production of proteins possessing more disulfide bonds still remains a challenge. The combination of all these factors, together with the exceeded solubility of over-expressed recombinant protein leads to the aggregation of recombinant proteins, which often gives rise to IBs formation. \n\nIBs were for a long time understood as inert deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins in some way separated from the cellular repair mechanism. However, it is now known that protein aggregation into IBs is reversible [26] and dependent on the physiological state of the host organism. IBs are very dynamic structures that are continuously formed in the host cell and simultaneously the proteins are also released from them and refolded or degraded by the cell repair mechanisms [27]. \n\nSince protein aggregates represented an obstacle in recombinant protein production, various mechanisms that would enable production of soluble proteins in bacteria were studied. Yields of soluble protein expression can be increased by chaperone co-expression [28], fusion of target protein with suitable fusion tags [29], choosing appropriate host strain and promoter system or modifying the cultivation conditions (e.g., growth temperature, media composition) [17]. However, studies showed, that protein solubility does not imply protein activity, as large amount of the proteins found soluble in the cytoplasm can be biologically inactive [7,8]. \n\nThe formation of protein aggregates is a self-assembly process in bacterial cells. As there is no compartmentalization, proteins are simultaneously synthesized on multiple locations in the bacterial cytoplasm and various transitional folding states of the target protein are formed (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Seel et al. state that due to correct protein folding and protein turnover, energy can be conserved and the biomass yield improved. Perhaps the most popular example for altering temperature as a means of an optimized process outcome can be found during the production of recombinant protein, such as by using E. coli as a heterologous expression system [12]. During the process, typically at the stage of the induction of protein expression, a temperature shift is performed, lowering the process temperature by several \u2022 C. This temperature shift does not benefit overall transcription or translation activity, but instead, results in an increased amount of correctly folded protein. This is due to lower amounts of recombinant protein being less likely to form inactive, insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies), and allowing more time for correct folding after translation due to lower protein production rates. In the case of enzyme production, correctly folded protein is a prerequisite of enzymatic activity, and therefore, in most cases, temperature shifts are applied [114]. Another possibility for using temperature as a method for optimizing protein production is the application of thermo-inducible promoter systems. Considering the perspective of bioprocess engineering, it is of high interest to combine strain engineering and process development approaches to maximize overall productivity and yields. Strong chemically inducible promoters and expression systems that are commonly used in laboratory-scale protein expression [115] cause a high degree of metabolic burden to the microorganisms, and as such, protein production results in a simultaneous reduction of growth. It is therefore beneficial for optimized process design to be able to uncouple biomass growth from protein biosynthesis. Furthermore, production of recombinant proteins at early stages of cultivation often results in reduced overall yields, as many proteins are sensitive to degradation by proteases [114,116]. To counteract this instability of recombinant proteins, inducible promoter systems are a possible tool. Thermo-inducible promoter systems have the advantage of not requiring intrusion into the process, as chemical inductors are not required. As such, the risk of contamination, as well as the costs of the process, may be reduced.",

            "text": "Heterologous recombinant proteins may be formed in a highly soluble biologically active form when their genomes are fused to the E. coli genes with thioredoxin [51]. Few fusions maintain the properties of thioredoxin that are produced by the methods of osmotic shock or freeze/thaw, along with strong thermal stability. Thioredoxin has a low molecular size (11 kDa) and is typically derived in a soluble form at 40% of the total cell protein [52]. Another effective approach for the development of inclusion bodies that comprise heterologous proteins is to lower the growth temperature from 37 to 30 \u2022 C [53,54]. Higher yields are usually obtained in the cytoplasm than in the periplasmic space [55]. It is necessary to export cytoplasmic proteins for the ease of the purification process and promote proper folding. This can be achieved with proteins comprising disulfide bonds since the cytoplasm eliminates an atmosphere to a great extent [56]. The fusion is achieved with a leader peptide at the N-terminal to secrete certain proteins into the periplasm. Osmotic shock or cell wall permeabilization is used to draw the proteins out of the periplasm and into the medium [57]. A mechanism involving regulation with promoter elements (lac, tac, and trc) is employed to increase the output. Promoter structures need to be defined and closely controlled to achieve a low-basal speech quality and must be easily transferable to other E. coli strains that require a simple and inexpensive induction technique, independent of the medium ingredients [58]. \n\nThe secretion of recombinant proteins by E. coli into the periplasm or extracellular medium has several benefits over intracellular development as inclusion bodies. It improves packaging, folding, and in vivo downstream stability and enables the manufacture of soluble active proteins at reduced processing costs [59][60][61][62].",

The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction). Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction, cell lysis conditions etc. which play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form in vivo have been optimized. We have studied the effect of assistance of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we",

            "text": "Expression of recombinant protein in inclusion bodies always poses a challenge during the purification step. It is hence always preferred to achieve the soluble expression of the recombinant protein which ensures less hassles during purification and also, it is likely to give active protein molecule.. Soluble expression of recombinant protein has the biggest advantage during the fermentation process as very few inherent bacterial proteins are expressed in soluble form. Additionally, soluble protein expression reduces downstream processing cost which has a direct impact on total production cost. There are several methods to convert proteins expressed in inclusion bodies into a soluble form, but it can be time consuming and expensive. Fusion of solubility tags to desired protein, selection of different vector-host combinations, and optimisation in expression conditions are the potential modification scientists attempt to achieve soluble protein expression. One such cost-effective approach reported by Munjal et al. [20], as recombinant extracellular cellulase expression in ethanologenic strain of E. coli by replacement of inducible promoter with native constitutive promoter (gapA). \n\nVariations in the usage of solubility tags/signal peptide are also reported by some researchers. Amore et al. [17] and Liu et al. [29] used signal peptide of source organism whereas Kim et al. [30] expressed cellulase on the outer membrane of E. coli in fusion with ice nucleation protein (membrane protein of P. syringae). \n\nIn the current work, we used the slow protein induction strategy with 0.5 mM IPTG induction for 16 h at 28 \u00b0C. This helped in achieving the cellulase expression in soluble fraction rather than inclusion bodies. This strategy was definitely advantageous as it helped in lesser downstream steps because no solubility tag was used. Solubility tag poses problems due to the requirement of its removal to obtain authentic protein. Slow induction process with a lesser concentration of inducer can reduce upstream process cost in large-scale production. \n\nIncreased solubility of cellulase protein and N terminal 6X His tag allowed simple two-step metal affinity purification of the protein [31]. Purity of the eluted fraction was evaluated in comparison with the crude cell lysate on SDS-PAGE.",

            "text": "In recent research, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has established itself as one of the most extensively used systems in the industrial production of recombinant proteins, which owes much to the high yield of production that is possible with this system, the low manufacturing cost, a wellcharacterized expression system, and amenability to high cell-density fermentation biotechnology [1,2]. In addition, due to a lack of appropriate folding-assistance proteins and cofactors that can mediate post-translational modifications, the likelihood of inclusion body formation is considerately high when heterologous proteins are expressed in E. coli [3]. However, continuous endeavors have been devoted to overcome such limitations. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering strategies, there are many solutions that can potentially provide successful expression of soluble recombinant proteins in an E. coli expression system, including choosing a suitable expression host and vector, codon usage, sequence optimization, inducer concentration, expression temperature, fusion technology and co-expression of a chaperone. \n\nTherapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals have been applied widely particularly in respect of the broader interest in recombinant technology. These proteins are required in sufficient quantities; however, it remains a challenge to obtain enough proteins from natural sources. To express eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, the concept of fusion technology represents an effective method to enhance protein solubility [4]. In a contemporary study, fusion expression vectors provide useful tools to strengthen the solubility and productivity of eukaryotic proteins, including Maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance A (NusA), Thioredoxin A (Trx) and translation initiation factor 2 domain I (IF2). Furthermore, it has recently been determined that fusion partners like the Fasciola hepatica 8 kDa antigen (Fh8), the E. coli secreted protein A (EspA) and KDPG aldolase (EDA) have emerged with the intent of improving synthetic yields, enhancing solubility and folding processes and simplifying the purification of eukaryotic proteins [3][4][5].",

Therefore, the present research was conducted to produce a variant of this enzyme (reteplase) in E. coli Top10 bacteria using pBAD/g\u0406\u0406A plasmid. Induction of proteins using pBAD/g\u0406\u0406A system has been reported by many investigators 4,10,18,21 although none have studied the expression of reteplase in this system.\n\nOne important advantage of pBAD/g\u0406\u0406A plasmid used in the present study is the addition of signal sequence to the N-terminal segment of reteplase enabling it to be secreted into the periplasmic space. This would provide a better environment for proper folding of this enzyme 21 . Several proteins such as pancreatic prokallikrein, human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and protease inhibitors have been produced by secretion systems in E. coli periplasmic space [22][23][24][25] . In this study, the amount of the expressed reteplase in peri-plasmic space was low. However, a high amount of this protein was present inside the cell as inclusion bodies. This might be due to high expression of proteins overwhelming the export machinery of cells for exporting inclusion bodies to the periplasmic space. Similar results have been reported by other investigators 8,14,24 .\n\nOn the other hand, high levels of reteplase present as inclusion bodies prompted us to explore this system for protein production and purification. The main advantage of inclusion bodies is that they are mostly composed of recombinant proteins and can be easily isolated from the cell debris 8,22,25 .\n\nData available on extraction and purification of reteplase are limited. Production of this protein in prokaryote cells is associated with the formation of insoluble mass and inactive form of inclusion bodies [7][8][9]25,26 . Thus, the main problem in purification process of inclusion bodies is optimizing the refolding and renaturation conditions by preventing the formation of inactive aggregates. Therefore, different refolding strategies have been used including the addition of arginine and oxidizing",

            "text": "E. coli is a widely used expression host for recombinant protein production. 3] However, the product is usually expressed inside the cell, which requires cell disruption in downstream processing, leading to the release of unwanted host cell proteins and other contaminants, like lipids and DNA. [4] If the target protein is produced as insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs), additional IB processing is needed. \n\nEspecially with the growing interest in continuous manufacturing, [5,6] extracellular production is an important enabler for future bioprocessing with E. coli. Secretion of recombinant protein to the medium furthermore enhances solubility, stability, and biological activity of the product. [7] This can be achieved either by one-step-secretion (directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space) via the T1SS or T3SS system, or by two-step-secretion: In the first step, the protein is directed through the inner membrane via the Secor Tat-pathway. In the second step, the outer membrane (OM) is made permeable, or \"leaky,\" to release the product to the medium. [1] Numerous studies on how to increase leakiness during cultivation exist and several reviews cover this research in detail. [1,3,8] ne approach to increase leakiness is chemical permeabilization by addition of media supplements, like Triton-X, glycine, or EDTA. However, those additives usually have detrimental effects on the viability of the cells and might harm the product. [1] Another approach is the generation of leaky E. coli mutants. Many expression systems that show permanently high leakiness have been engineered to date. Their OM structure is usually altered by mutations in cell envelope genes and signal peptides are optimized for higher translocation efficiency. [1,9] However, detailed process information at bioreactor scale is often missing for these strains. \n\nAnother reported strategy is the enhancement of OM permeability via cultivation conditions. In this regard, previous research focused mainly on the process parameters temperature and specific growth rate (). Shokri, Sanden, and Larsson [10] showed that growth rate-dependent changes in the membrane composition affect protein leakage.",

We optimized the induction strategy of \u03b2-fructofuranosidase in E. coli to assist secretory protein production.

It was indicated that the rate of protein synthesis matched the rate of protein folding to form more soluble proteins at 25\u00b0C. Figure 4(b) showed that the optimal concentration of IPTG was 0.5 mmol/L. When the concentration of IPTG is lower than 0.5 mmol/L, it was not enough to bind the repressor protein, while higher IPTG concentration may have certain toxicity to the cells. After IPTG induction for 6-12 h, both protein and enzyme activity continuously increased over time (Figure 4(b)). With the prolongation of induction time, the accumulation of by-products from the metabolism of E. coli adversely affected the system, and the protein expression and enzyme activity no more increased.

However, overexpression of recombinant protein in E. coli often found as inclusion bodies. While formation of inclusion bodies is beneficial in protein isolation from other cellular components, most of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies are misfolded which have lost their biological activity. Protein refolding allows misfolded protein to rearrange into their native conformation which exhibit its biological activity, thus protein refolding become a pivotal step to recover active protein. However, protein refolding was affected by various factors; hence, screening of refolding condition was required to meet the optimal result. As a consequence, rapid and efficient characterization method is required to monitor the refolding performance. In this review, we will briefly give an overview about protein refolding method, chemical additives in protein refolding, and also provide insight in structural characterization to evaluate refolding performance.",

            "text": "The difficult process and high cost of extraction and separation of natural enterokinase and its probable contamination by other protease led to a great attempt to produce it on larger scale and lower finished cost in E. coli. A lot of research has been done to produce this enzyme in E. coli (Skala 2013;Chun et al. 2011) and Pichia pastoris (Smith 2013) in the form of IB (inclusion bodies) or soluble protein. Production of active enzymes in most of them was limited and needed several steps of purification or dialysis. \n\nThioredoxin (TRX) as a chaperon-like fusion tag helps the solubility and stability of the fusion protein (Berndt 2008). It can be followed by DDDDK enterokinase and cleaved from the target protein using enterokinase activity. \n\nDifferent strains of E. coli have been developed for different purposes. Among them, Bl21 (DE3) with Escherichia coli T7 RNA polymerase-based protein production in combination with T7 promoter-based expression vector allows high-efficiency protein expression of any gene that is under the control of a T7 promoter. The lon protease deficiency and the lack of ompT, outer membrane protease, which can degrade recombinant proteins during purification serve as advantages of BL21 (Grodberg and Dunn 1988). NiCo21 (DE3) and SHuffle T7 strains have been also engineered to minimize E. coli protein contamination and recombinant protein folding containing multiple disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm, respectively (Robichon et al. 2011;Lobstein et al. 2012;Kim et al. 2021). \n\nOne of the complexities of enterokinase production is related to the multiple disulfide bonds and an unpaired thiol that directs the protein production process to the IB formation (Schumann and Ferreira 2004). One strategy to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies is to slow down the production of recombinant proteins at low temperatures because the ability of the protein to fold at temperatures above 30 \u00b0C is decreased. Sometimes, it is probably the easiest and the most useful method which can prevent inclusion body formation by facilitating correct folding.",

E. coli grow rapidly in culture and can achieve high-density growth in a short period of time using inexpensive media that is suitable for continuous fermentation. The yield of recombinant protein per unit volume tends to be relatively high, and can represent up to 30% of the secreted protein. Recombinant lipase expressed in E. coli can be located in the cytoplasm or secreted to the extracellular environment; it can exist in the form of inclusion bodies or expressed as a fusion protein with a FLAG epitope tag or fluorescent protein in order to avoid intracellular degradation and to simplify the subsequent separation and purification processes (Yin et al., 2007). \n\nHowever, heterologous expression in E. coli is associated with the following disadvantages: (1) when eukaryotic proteins, especially heterologous proteins containing disulfide bonds, are expressed in E. coli, inactive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be formed due to improper protein folding; (2) Heterologous proteins that are not secreted often do not undergo proper folding and post-translational modification; this can lead to inactivation and degradation of heterologous proteins by the host; (3) the recombinant protein of interest needs to be separated from many background E. coli proteins, resulting in the need for complex separation and purification steps; (4) the E. coli expression systems involves contamination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is a proinflammatory molecule in mammalian hosts that plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction with the innate immune system. Other commonly used prokaryotic expression systems include those based in B. subtilis, Ralstonia eutropha, and Pseudomonas spp. Compared with the E. coli expression system, the B. subtilis system facilitates recombinant protein secretion, and has no Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide components; as such, this system is suitable for large-scale highdensity fermentation.",

            "text": "The development of complementary technologies enabled the successful production of recombinant polypeptides in bacteria and opened to biology researchers new avenues as obtaining suitable amounts of proteins necessary for their experimental work became easy, fast, and inexpensive. Nevertheless, the recombinant approach remained somehow unpredictable, since many constructs resisted to apparent production or accumulated as aggregates.Several factors and physical/chemical conditions that could improve the accumulation of native-like protein were identified. At the same time, it was acknowledged that the outcome of most of them was erratic and that almost any protein required its own specific optimized set of conditions to achieve its correct folding. The attempt to understand the critical points specific for recombinant protein production missed the goal of setting universally useful protocols, but contributed to the increase of the rate of success by proposing always new empiric combinations.Nevertheless, the results published in the recent literature allow for a better comprehension of some key mechanisms controlling protein production in E. coli and could enable the elaboration of rational methodologies for improving the quantitative and qualitative features of the produced polypeptides. This result will be achieved when the identification of the limiting step that impairs the accomplishment of the native folding for any single construct will become straightforward. This minireview will discuss how factors such as the expression rate, the folding machinery, and the secretion efficiency may impact the final protein yields.",

In practice, many things can go wrong, and distinct problems can be found including poor growth of the host, inclusion body formation, or lack of protein biological activity (Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). Indeed, targeting an overexpressed MP to a membrane in such a way they can insert and achieve its native structure is far from being an easy task, once they tend to be toxic, leading to low expression yields of often misfolded and aggregated MP (Popot 2018;Rajesh et al. 2011). Moreover, the high diversity of structures and physico-chemical properties displayed by MP makes unfeasible to accurately predict if a protein of interest will express well, be easy to purify, and be biologically active or crystallize in any given experimental protocol (Bernaudat et al. 2011). Based on the exposed, the development of improved strategies in the recombinant MP production pipeline foreseeing to increase their expression yields in a correctly folded form is crucial in MP research. The evaluation of purified protein quality is crucial in any protein production process and should be accurately performed to avoid irreproducible and misleading observations in the subsequent studies (Raynal et al. 2014). After production, MP need to be efficiently solubilized (recently reviewed by Hardy et al. 2018 andPopot 2018) and purified (Pandey et al. 2016), from which their quality in terms of purity, homogeneity, activity, and structural conformity should be assessed (Oliveira and Domingues 2018;Raynal et al. 2014). In this review, generic guidelines and host characteristics aiming an accurate choice of the host expression system that better suits particular needs will be initially overviewed in this review, and then we discuss important advances reported at the level of the upstream stage of recombinant MP production processes using E. coli, P. pastoris, and mammalian cell lines, representative of major expression systems used for protein expression. Subsequently, general techniques to perform the quality control of the target protein are presented and at the end, insights and directions for a successful MP production pipeline are shown.",

Recent functional and structural studies have revealed that IBs are not dead-end aggregates but undergo dynamic changes, including aggregation, refunctionalization of the protein and proteolysis. Both, aggregation of the folding intermediates and turnover of IBs are influenced by the cellular situation and a number of well-studied chaperones and proteases are included. IBs mostly contain only minor impurities and are relatively homogenous.ResultsIBs of \u03b1-glucosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae after overproduction in Escherichia coli contain a large amount of (at least 12 different) major product fragments, as revealed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE). Matrix-Assisted-Laser-Desorption/Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass-Spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) identification showed that these fragments contain either the N- or the C-terminus of the protein, therefore indicate that these IBs are at least partially created by proteolytic action.

The quality of the IBs was also not influenced by the sampling time, cultivation medium (complex and mineral salt medium), production strategy (shake flask, fed-batch fermentation process), production strength (T5-lac or T7 promoter), strain background (K-12 or BL21), or addition of different protease inhibitors during IB preparation.Conclusions\u03b1-glucosidase is fragmented before aggregation, but neither by proteolytic action on the IBs by the common major proteases, nor during downstream IB preparation.

            "text": "E. coli is preferred for heterologous protein production because of its fast growth, simple fermentation, uncomplicated nutritional and sterility requirements, and extensive characterisation [1]. Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

It is of great interest to investigate the empirical impact of technical failures to understand and mitigate their impact accurately and reduce economic damage. We investigated the impact in the upstream and downstream of a recombinant antibody fragment inclusion body production process chain to provide integrated empirical data and knowledge. First, we provided a reproducible process chain that yielded high inclusion body content, high specific product titer, and a refolding yield of 30%. The inclusion body downstream proved to be of high reproducibility. Through the intended introduction of technical failures, we were not only able to shed more light on the empirical responses in the upstream and downstream, but also on process-boosting parameters that would have been neglected. Herein, a short increase in temperature during the cultivation clearly increased the refolding yield.",

It has been used for this purpose for more than 40 years, so there is much accumulated knowledge about its advantages and disadvantages as an expression platform. Rosano and Ceccarelli review the tools at hand (expression vectors, strains, media composition, etc.) when using E. coli as a host (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different approaches for solving common problems, such as inclusion body (IB) formation or low yield, are also presented. \n\nOther authors delve a little deeper into these issues. Costa and coauthors give a thorough description of different fusion tags that can be appended to the target protein in order to increase its solubility and/or ease its purification from the cellular milieu (Costa et al., 2014). Along this line, Correa and coauthors present a very promising approach to straightforwardly assess the solubility of a recombinant protein by cloning the corresponding gene in 12 different expression vectors in parallel (Correa et al., 2014). Even though IB formation is mainly regarded as a nuance in the production of recombinant proteins, Ramon and coworkers make the case that this is not always true and focus on the positive side of IBs, highlighting the advantages of producing recombinant proteins as IBs for basic and applied research (Ramon et al., 2014). No or low yield can be the result of codon bias and Elena and coauthors look into one of the strategies used for solving this problem, the expression of codon optimized genes (Elena et al., 2014). Of great importance is their account of the application of this technology in the industrial setting. Not always the desired product is a protein, sometimes metabolites and fine chemicals are the goal. The review of Ceccoli and coauthors details with numerous examples how E. coli and other microorganisms can be turned into biocatalysts by strain engineering (Ceccoli et al., 2014). High-value products can thus be obtained from pure recombinant enzyme or from whole-cell systems, turning the host into an exquisitely designed and environmentally friendly chemical factory.",

            "text": "Single-chain antibodies have several advantages and are considered a promising treatment in cancer targeted therapy (23,24). The E. coli expression system is the most commonly used system to produce recombinant proteins. In spite of economical and biological benefits of E. coli expression system, it suffers from several noticeable shortcomings (15). One of its most serious limitations is the aggregation of misfolded recombinant proteins which leads to the formation of IBs (17,25). Insoluble IBs are serious obstacles in producing biologically active recombinant proteins. Various approaches have been used to overcome these restrictions, including applying various molecular chaperones (26) and expression in the periplasmic space (27). In addition, reducing the inducer concentrations and the culture temperature decrease the speed and the level of expression, providing adequate time for proteins to fold correctly (28), (29). \n\nThe periplasmic expression has several benefits compared to the cytoplasmic expression as the more appropriate formation of disulfide bonds, the small number of proteases and the presence of fewer proteins in the periplasmic space lead to higher quality proteins (30,31). Targeting recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space by using signal sequences (e.g., PelB, ompA, PhoA \u2026) in a Sec-dependent system poses some difficulties, such as protein aggregation in the cytoplasm. Using low temperature and co-expression with secretion chaperones (e.g., DnaK/ DnaJ and GroEL-GroES) could overcome this obstacle (32). In this study, we applied various strategies to produce active huscFv in the E. coli expression system. Coexpression of different chaperone plasmids with huscFv under low temperature and low inducer concentration noticeably enhanced (up to 54%) the solubility of the recombinant scFv. Co-expressing pG-KJE8 chaperone plasmid carrying dnaK-dnaJ-grpE-groES-groEL cytoplasmic chaperone with huscFv resulted in highest solubility.",

            "text": "Even at low levels, these errors may cause an impact on the tertiary structure, premature termination of protein synthesis or amino acid misincorporation which results in low protein expression (Gustafsson et al., 2004). One strategy to bypass the issue with codon bias is to synthesize the whole human gene based on codon usage in E. coli through site-directed mutagenesis, which is currently a preferred method; however, it is limited by the high cost of production and time consumption (S\u00f8rensen and Mortensen, 2005). An alternative method that is less time consuming utilizes the co-transformation of E. coli strains with a plasmid(s) containing a gene encoding the tRNA cognate to the rare codons (Dieci et al., 2000). Increasing the copy number allows for E. coli to be manipulated to match the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes (Dieci et al., 2000). Currently, there are numerous commercial E. coli strains available that harbor plasmids containing gene sequences encoding the tRNA for rare codons, such as BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL, BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RP and Rosetta (DE3) (Baeshen et al., 2015). Another common problem associated with recombinant protein expression in E. coli involve inclusion body formation, which refers to insoluble and inactive protein aggregates (Hartley and Kane, 1988). E. coli producing recombinant proteins have the ability to assemble in cells and form conglomerates of inclusion bodies as well as result in erroneous protein folding which hinder the extraction of proteins directly from the cell leading to costly purification of proteins (Zweers et al., 2008). Inclusion bodies formed from lack of proportion between protein solubilization and aggregation can be resolved by combining the desired protein with a solubility enhancer fusion partner acting as an intrinsic chaperone in order to ensure the production of soluble recombinant proteins (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014).",

            "text": "The use of recombinant proteins has increased with the advent of various expression hosts that facilitate their soluble, biologically active, and large-scale production. Although mammalian expression systems possess many advantages (Wurm 2004), the bacterial expression system is considered the most efficient host compared to other organisms for the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals because of its various attributes, including high expression yield, cost-effectiveness, rapid protein expression, and proficient scale-up. E. coli is considered the most promising bacterial strain for recombinant protein production; however, it lacks machinery for posttranslational modifications that can lead to inefficient protein folding and aggregation (in the form of inclusion bodies) (Stewart et al. 1998; Bessette et al. 1999). Aggregation can affect the biological activity and stability of therapeutic proteins and is considered a risk factor for increased immunogenicity. The major challenges in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies are isolation, washing, solubilization, and refolding procedures (Clark 2001;Middelberg 2002). Much effort is required for the development of a robust procedure for producing industrial-grade proteins that are stable, properly folded, and free from aggregation. \n\nThe co-expression of target proteins with soluble fusion partners for heterologous protein production in E. coli can lead to enhanced expression and efficient purification. Exploiting its chaperoning properties, the SUMO tag allows high-level expression through proper folding of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004;Butt et al. 2005). A high soluble protein expression level can be attained using this fusion system, yielding approximately 30% of the total soluble protein fraction in E. coli (Wang et al. 2010). The SUMO protease recognizes the SUMO fusion partner, facilitating precise proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in the production of native proteins. pET SUMO has been widely used to produce many therapeutically important proteins, including human interferon alpha-2a (Bis et al. 2014), BMP-14 (Li et al. 2011), human interleukin-11 (Nguyen et al. 2018), andFGF-21 (Wang et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Excessive production of heterologous proteins in E. coli often leads to their improper folding and/or aggregation with the formation of inclusion bodies. This problem can be solved by optimizing the cultivation and induction conditions; however, it is almost impossible to find suitable conditions for hydrophobic proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Typically, different approaches for converting inclusion bodies into a biologically active protein rarely provide sufficient refolded protein yield without proper optimization. The second stage of optimization was aimed to evaluate the effect of chemical additives on the refolding efficiency. Various chemical additives to the standard refolding buffer allow for a complex effect on the refolding process. Redox pairs of substances, such as glutathione, cysteine/cystine, accelerate the \"shuffling\" of disulfide bonds and reduce the refolding time (Hudson et al., 2015). Glycerol acts as a stabilizer of protein molecules by increasing the order of solvent molecules around the proteins. Increasing the concentration of glycerol improves the stability of the enzyme even at high protein concentrations. Although stabilizers such as glycerol or polyethylene glycol increase yield during refolding, protein aggregation can occur concurrently. Therefore, these types of supplements have always been used in combination with an aggregation inhibitor such as arginine (Yamaguchi and Miyazaki, 2014) or proline (Alibolandi and Mirzahoseini, 2011). We screened the main additives in the basic refolding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 200 mM NaCl), which proved to be effective in suppressing protein aggregation. Refolding buffers supplemented with 5% sucrose, 5% glycerol, 1% PEG 3000, 0.1M arginine, 1M proline, 0.5% Triton X100, 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.5% N-lauryl sarcosine sodium salt were tested (Supplementary Table S2). Testing was performed by refolding the full-length chitinase using the \"rapid dilution\" method in the buffer (see above). Tween-20 and Triton X100 did not significantly affect the yield of refolded chi",

            "text": "biotechnological production of protein based therapeutics. Consequently, a large effort has been devoted to the development of orthogonal strategies to increase soluble protein yields, including in vitro protein synthesis (Ventura, 2005). Bacterial extracts have become a convenient means to produce recombinant proteins in vitro, because they contain all the machinery required for protein synthesis. This technology has rendered a significant volume of data on the behavior of proteins during their cell-free synthesis. As illustrated by Tokmakov, these datasets can be exploited to derive the physicochemical and structural properties associated with the solubility and aggregation of eukaryotic proteins (Tokmakov). However, the cell is a very crowded environment and during cell-free experiments the concentration of cellular components is significantly diluted, questioning whether these assays recapitulate intracellular conditions. To address this question, the group of Taguchi has made an effort to synthetize more than 100 proteins in a bacterial cell-free system, either in the absence or in the presence of specific crowding agents. Their results demonstrate that the impact of crowding on aggregation is not generic, but protein-dependent (Niwa et al.). \n \nProtein aggregates are not distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm of bacteria, instead, they are mainly located at one or at the two poles of the organism. This localization has important functional consequences, from regulating signaling to protect the rest of the cell from misfolded species. In an original study, Emberly and co-workers from Simon Fraser University demonstrated that the localization of aggregating proteins in bacteria depends on their expression rates. This suggests that the localization of protein aggregates is constrained by aggregation itself, but also by nucleoid occlusion (Scheu et al.). When the accumulation of these polar aggregates results from the recombinant protein expression, they are named inclusion bodies (IBs). Despite they contain certain impurities, IBs are usually highly enriched in the target polypeptide. This property, together with their insolubility, allows for an easy purification of the recombinant polypeptide. In many cases, the protein can be recovered afterwards in its biologically active form upon in vitro unfolding and subsequent refolding, as demonstrated by",

            "text": "As the host, Escherichia coli is fundamentally important in the manufacture of a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical products, owing to its easy culture, fast growth, simple fermentation and easy genetic manipulation [1]. High production of recombinant protein in E. coli is a combination of several factors such as efficiency of transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA folding, codon usage, protein solubility and folding [2]. So, the strategies for optimizing expression greatly vary from gene to gene and are often determined by trial and error. \n\nIn E. coli, tRNA levels for rare codons AGG, AGA, AUA, CCC, CUA and GGA restrain high-level production of the recombinant proteins [3]. Codon optimization could enhance soluble protein production [4,5], but sometimes it also impaired protein folding and decreased activity [6,7]. Similarly, supply of deficient tRNAs increased expression levels of recombinant proteins, but decreased soluble production of some recombinant proteins [8]. So far, obtaining well-folded recombinant proteins with high yield remains a major challenge, as yield, solubility and conformational quality of soluble proteins could not be simultaneously optimized in E. coli [9]. \n\nFusion tags are frequently applied for improving protein solubility and facilitating rapid purification by affinity chromatography. To avoid potential interference with biological activity or crystallization, the fused tags need to be removed, which is often achieved by a specific protease that recognizes and cleaves the engineered sequence between the tag and target protein [10]. Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) has been identified as a tool, owing to its stringent recognition sequence. Production of wild type TEVp or the mutant TEVpS219V with inhibition of auto-cleavage in E. coli is limited due to its low solubility [10].",

            "text": "A major drawback of overexpressing recombinant proteins in E. coli is that they often do not readily fold into their native conformation. Instead, they can quickly form aggregates under conventional expression conditions, that is, when chemically or nutritionally inducible promoters drive the expression at physiological temperatures. Recombinant proteins readily accumulate into so-called inclusion bodies, for this reason, alternative protocols have been developed to recover these proteins. To obtain a given amount of soluble protein, a common approach involves the production of larger amounts of the protein expressed as inclusion bodies. Additional processes to recover the later protein may include in vitro refolding, strain engineering to increase the concentration of molecular chaperones, or cell cultures at relatively low temperatures. Low-temperature protein expression in E. coli prevents the degradation of proteolytically sensitive products and restricts the overall protein synthesis [25,148], this may result in a higher yield of soluble protein versus aggregation-prone proteins or unstable products. However, cell growth may be notably affected under these conditions. Alternatively, bacterial expression systems with vectors directed by cold-inducible promoters may be grown at low temperatures for short periods only. This strategy often leads to overexpression of the target protein with the advantages cited above for cultures performed fully at low temperatures, i.e., with greater productivity of the target protein [25,149]. \n\nThe cspA cold shock promoter and its regulatory elements have been well suited to direct and optimize, in E. coli, the expression of recombinant proteins at low temperatures [150][151][152]. Vasina and Baneyx [152] assessed the usefulness of the cspA promoter to drive the expression of lacZ. The cspA promoter (586 bp) consisted of the cspA promoter region followed by its authentic RBS and the initial 24 nucleotides of the cspA open reading frame. The synthesis of \u03b2-galactosidase was efficiently repressed at 37 \u00b0C, but it was rapidly induced at temperatures in the range of 30 to 15 \u00b0C, leading to a 3-to 5-fold increase in specific activity relative to the control cultures.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins of interest. One of the major concerns in the overproduction process is the formation of insoluble structures called inclusions bodies (IB) [1,2]. IB formation results from the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides that have escaped quality control by chaperones and proteases to interact through their exposed hydrophobic regions before precipitating [3]. Aggregate formation and features are influenced by various growth conditions such as temperature and pH [4], culture phase [5] and glucose/oxygen availability [6].\n\nIn vivo protein aggregation is a dynamic reversible process [7]. Chaperones involved in aggregate dissociation, e.g. DnaK/DnaJ/ClpB and IbpA/IbpB, colocalize with IB in E. coli [8][9][10][11]. Recently, it has been reported that aggregate cellular localization is not random [9]. Small protein aggregates are delivered to a cell pole to form larger structures that are further dissolved by an energy dependent process [12]. All proteins in IB were initially considered as unfolded, but it has been shown that some polypeptides inside aggregates are present in an active form [2,13,14]. Several groups reported the formation of \"non-classical\" IB mainly characterized by the presence of folded and soluble recombinant proteins [15,16].\n\nHere, we report a novel example of \"non-classical\" IB that contain folded and soluble recombinant proteins and only transiently interact with the IpbA chaperone.\n\nIndeed, overproduction of Brucella abortus PdhS cytoplasmic histidine kinase [17] in E. coli revealed that PdhS-mCherry fusions were first folded and soluble in aggregates formed during the stationary phase of culture before forming insoluble structures having all the characteristics of \"classical\" IB. These \"classical\" IB recruited IpbA-YFP, as previously reported for other IB in E. coli [11], unlike the intermediate \"non classical\" IB. We observed that IbpA-YFP was able to form foci with very dynamic properties inside E. coli and",

            "text": "The objective of the research was to understand the structural determinants governing protein aggregation into inclusion bodies during expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) and asparaginase were expressed as inclusion bodies in E.coli and the kinetics of aggregate formation was analyzed in details. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were of smaller size (200 nm) and the size of the aggregates did not increase with induction time. In contrast, the seeding and growth behavior of hGH inclusion bodies were found to be sequential, kinetically stable and the aggregate size increased from 200 to 800 nm with induction time. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies showed higher resistance to denaturants and proteinase K degradation in comparison to those of asparaginase inclusion bodies. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were completely solubilized at 2\u20133 M urea concentration and could be refolded into active protein, whereas 7 M urea was required for complete solubilization of hGH inclusion bodies. Both hGH and asparaginase inclusion bodies showed binding with amyloid specific dyes. In spite of its low \u03b2-sheet content, binding with dyes was more prominent in case of hGH inclusion bodies than that of asparaginase. Arrangements of protein molecules present in the surface as well as in the core of inclusion bodies were similar. Hydrophobic interactions between partially folded amphiphillic and hydrophobic alpha-helices were found to be one of the main determinants of hGH inclusion body formation. Aggregation behavior of the protein molecules decides the nature and properties of inclusion bodies.",

            "text": "Bacterial inclusion bodies are commonly known as insoluble protein aggregates, originally developed during recombinant proteosynthesis. In Escherichia coli cells, they are observed since the beginning of recombinant technologies (Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2012). As they have been seen as a major obstacle in the production of soluble proteins, many protein-specific molecular and biochemical strategies have been employed to avoid their formation. Nonetheless, yet around 80 % of overexpressed recombinant proteins are packed into IBs (J\u00fcrgen et al., 2010). Consequently, when protein itself cannot be expressed in a high amount in soluble form, IBs are considered the main source of recombinant protein. However, timeconsuming and expensive refolding strategies are required to obtain an active and properly folded form. Over the years, understanding the relation between their origin, function, and properties opened new possibilities for direct IBs applications in a wide range of areas. Furthermore, many types of research proved, that even partially or incorrectly folded proteins within IBs are capable of maintaining their functional or catalytic activity. Thus, IBs, previously viewed as undesirable waste have become a subject of interest in fields of medicine, biotechnology, pharmacy, material science, and more.",

            "text": "Formation of inclusion body aggregates imposes a severe challenge in purification of bioactive recombinant protein from E. coli. The information about structural and physical properties of inclusion bodies during expression conditions is necessary for developing mild solubilization procedures which may result in improved recovery of bioactive protein. Better insight into the structural and physical properties of inclusion bodies can help in developing appropriate solubilization and refolding conditions during purification of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies. The present study reveals that depending on the aggregation properties of proteins, different types of inclusion bodies are formed in E. coli. Asparaginase IBs were around 100 nm in size whereas the size of hGH IBs was in the range of 200-600 nm. Small sized inclusion bodies are soft and are soluble in low concentration of urea where as large size inclusion bodies are denser and require high molar concentration of urea for complete solubilization. There was no significant effect of post induction period on quality and size of inclusion body aggregates for asparaginase where as for hGH the inclusion bodies size increased along with induction time. However, hGH inclusion bodies were tough and protease resistant from the beginning. Present study also put forward variation in kinetics of IB formation by different proteins. Proteins which form softer and smaller aggregates showed continuous seeding during expression period as contrary to the denser and harder IB forming proteins. Amyloid specific dye binding assays reveals the amyloidogenic nature of IB aggregates. Also, b-sheet conformation was not found to be solely responsible for protein aggregation into inclusion bodies as observed in the case hGH IBs. It is the interactive forces associated with the secondary structural elements of the protein that govern the aggregation kinetics leading to the formation of different types of IB aggregates. \n\nOn the basis of solubility and presence of biological activity, IBs have been categorized as classical and non-classical inclusion bodies [29]. The non-classical inclusion bodies have high amount of correctly folded target protein or its precursor and are produced at lower temperature [30]. Our observations indicated nonclassical nature of asparaginase IBs and classical nature of hGH IBs.",

            "text": "The second phase of the process targeted for further improvement in the functional production of rHSA for which we have explored assistance through chaperone co-expression. Molecular chaperones lie at the heart of protein quality control, aiding the nascent polypeptide to reach their final structure i.e. native form [31][32][33][34]. During overproduction of a recombinant protein, endogenous chaperone concentration is likely to be limited which may result in inclusion body formation. However, if chaperones are overexpressed concomitantly with the recombinant protein in vivo then they can help in the preferred folding of the expressed recombinant protein [35,36]. Despite numerous publications reporting large quantities of soluble recombinant protein with the assistance of chaperones in E. coli [37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45], no report is found till date on the attempts to fold rHSA in E. coli cytosol with the help of co-expressed chaperones. We exploited the opportunity to introduce molecular chaperones (GroEL-ES and TF) to assess the effect on the functional preparation of rHSA in the second phase of the process. \n\nTo our surprise, it was found that the expression of rHSA increased by twofold when co-expressed along with the TF chaperone, whereas it was diminished to a negligible level when co-expressed with GroEL-ES chaperone system as compared to when rHSA was expressed without any exogenous chaperone assistance (Fig. 4). This observation could be attributed to the fact that GroEL-ES chaperone is an ATP dependent chaperone and a cell over-expressing a tetra-decameric GroEL and a heptameric GroES along with the recombinant protein of interest undergoes stress, which can limit the cellular ability for recombinant protein synthesis [46][47][48]. Since the amount of the total expressed rHSA in presence of GroEL-ES system was too low, it led to diminished activity values when compared to the control.",

Common strategies including the use of: (1) plasmids with increased copy numbers such as the ones employing runaway replicons [39,40]; (2) strong transcriptional control signals including P L , Tac, and T7 promoters [41,42]; (3) efficient ribosome binding sites such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence [43]; (4) inducible promoters which may be activated by heat shocking [44], light induction [45] or chemicals, e.g., isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG); (5) a codon-optimized gene sequence [46,47]; and (6) an efficient plasmid maintenance system. These various methods have been commonly applied, either individually or in conjunction with a fusion approach, to achieving efficient expression of target proteins in E. coli.\n\nAlthough high yields of products may result from the application of above mentioned expression approaches, oftentimes, the products present themselves as insoluble inclusion bodies or aggregates. Unfortunately, these inclusion bodies are composed of denatured and misfolded proteins, which are functionally inactive [48,49]. Due to the rearrangements of disulfide bridges in the aggregates, despite going through the processes of denaturation and renaturation, the target proteins are unlikely able to regain their functional activities [48].\n\nFusion of a target protein to an affinity tag presents a viable approach to not only the purification of the final product, but also the preservation of the product as a soluble protein. It has been shown that protein tags such as maltose-binding protein [50], glutathione S-transferase [51], small ubiquitin modifying protein [52,53], and thioredoxin [54] might help improve the solubility of fusion products formed between the tags and target proteins (Figure 2). Given that a fusion product is expressed as a soluble and properly folded intermediate, and that it is readily purified using affinity chromatography and proteolytically processed at a recognition site engineered between",

            "text": "The E. coli cultivation data were collected at the Department of Biotechnology at the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences in Vienna. Two recombinant E. coli processes with different induction strategies were conducted in order to evaluate the in influence of the expression level of the inclusion body forming protein N pro GFPmut3.1 on the host metabolism. The standard strategy with a single pulse of inducer yielding in a fully induced system (in the following called experiment A) was compared to a process with continuous supply of limiting amounts of inducer resulting in a partially induced system (in the following called experiment B) [11]. The time point of induction of the partially induced system was set one doubling past feed start. The bioreactor, the used equipment as well as the on-and offline analysis was published in detail by Achm\u00fcller et al. [12]. The resulting process data shown in Figure 1 clearly emphasize the central impact of induction strategies on the cellular response of strong expression systems and their behavior in production processes. The product formation rate triggered by full induction is too high and the thereby provoked metabolic overload impedes cellular growth. The increase in the total cell dry weight (CDW) attained past induction was mainly caused by the formation of the recombinant protein. This means that growth and product formation were decoupled completely. In consequence of these reactions product formation and process control were maintained only for a short period. However, in the experiment with limited induction cells were able to cope with the metabolic load triggered by the recombinant gene expression level for more than one doubling. Product formation was tightly coupled to cellular growth but approximately 9 hours past induction the metabolic load level exceeded the cellular capacities. The glucose yield coefficient (Y X/S ) decreased and the cells lost their ability to divide. The net cell mass generated in this phase was channeled into cell size and the cells entered a similar state as in the process with full induction.\n\nIn order to analyze the cellular response to different induction strategies on the transcription level two independent DNA microarray experiments were performed. A dye-swap design was used and the cells in the noninduced state of each experiment were compared to samples past induction. Since the production period of the fully induced system was limited to approximately one generation (7 h at a growth rate of 0.1 h -",

            "text": "Bacteria are simple and cost effective systems for producing recombinant proteins. However, the over-expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria often generates misfolded proteins, which form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm [10]. As more applications require higher amounts of high-quality recombinant proteins, new systems and refinements to recombinant protein expression have been developed, notably simultaneous over-expression of chaperones for proper folding and solubility of generated proteins during expression [19]. For example, an established strategy to overcome the formation of inclusion bodies is to introduce a chaperone that helps solubilize the recombinant proteins [19]. Different proteins have been observed to interact with prion protein [20], namely, molecular chaperones from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as Pdia3, Grp58, and Hsp60 [20][21][22]. This is suggestive of an important role for molecular chaperones in early protein folding. Most of these chaperones possess protein disulfide isomerase-like properties or folding activities [23]. In the ER, disulfide bond formation is catalyzed by Ero1 and the PDI [24,25]. The over-expression of the molecular chaperones (GroELS, Skp or trigger factor) and isomerase (DsbC) has been shown to significantly increase the production yield of recombinant disulfide bond-containing antibodies [26]. Indeed, we have previously observed that co-expression of the chaperone QSOX prevents human or mouse PrP from aggregation by producing soluble PrP in E. coli [13]. \n\nIn bacteria, correct oxidative protein folding depends on both the disulfide bond protein A and B (DsbA/ DsbB) pathway, which catalyzes disulfide bond formation and disulfide bond isomerization [11]. In eukaryotes, ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1) and the protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) catalyze the equivalent reactions in the ER.",

However, many of the proteins of relevant biomedical value are found at low concentration in their native sources and therefore their production using alternative systems is a necessity. Genetically modified bacteria Escherichia coli are extremely efficient hosts for the large-scale production of heterologous proteins [7]. The obtainment of soluble recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli is generally chosen as the favorite form of production since these molecules usually acquire the native state without the need for further processing. However, it has been described that approximately 70% of proteins from eukaryotic organisms have the tendency to form intermolecular bonds at the cost of intramolecular contacts characteristic of native proteins and also tend to aggregate and accumulate as insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs) in the cytoplasm of E. coli, especially when the level of expression of the recombinant protein is high [8,9]. Nonetheless, there are advantages regarding the production of recombinant proteins as IBs, and one example is the facility of separation of the insoluble aggregates from the soluble fraction of the bacterial cytoplasm enabling the production of IBs with low levels of contaminants and reducing the need of purification steps. Another advantage in the case that the target protein suffers from autoproteolysis is its protection in an inactive state as IBs until refolding.",

            "text": "Bacteria are a straightforward choice to approach heterologous protein expression through recombinant DNA technologies. Their high productivity paired with the significantly lower culture cost of this platform when compared to other expression systems are very appealing features for large-scale protein production. Unfortunately, several issues inherent to the bacterial systems have hindered their adoption as preferred tools for recombinant vaccine production. These constraints revolve around the immunogenicity of residual bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the cell wall, or the inability to adequately fold complex proteins or those that undergo post-translational modifications when produced in their natural sources. \n\nRegarding the first issue, procedures for LPS removal from protein preparations are under continuous development. In fact, these efforts have provided alternative methods for their generic and successful industrial application to any protein produced in bacteria and intended for clinical applications, including vaccinology [76][77][78]. In contrast, insolubility of recombinant proteins and the consequent precipitation as cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies have represented a more persistent bottleneck in the biological fabrication of protein drugs in E. coli [79], reluctant to the generic application of most of the preventive metabolic strategies [80,81]. This fact has limited the number of bacterial protein products transferred to the market, which are in fact those that naturally, or with cost-effective post-production protocols, reach a conformation compatible with solubility while retaining the expected biological activity. Alternatively, since inclusion bodies might contain high proportions of folded protein species [82,83], strategies for the straightforward use of these protein aggregates as a formulation for recombinant antigens or immunomodulators are interesting and have offered intriguing data [84][85][86][87]. However, they have been in general discontinued. In addition, they face important regulatory issues because of their heterogeneous chemical composition [88]. \n\nE. coli stands as the most immediate host for recombinant protein production among suitable bacterial species due to its fast growth rate, a broad repertoire of genetic tools and a wide array of different strains engineered to solve most of the production challenges [89].",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins can impair cellular growth detectable through a slower increase in cell mass or even complete growth inhibition, slower carbon substrate uptake, and reduced respiratory activity. The extent of this inhibition is strongly influenced by the properties of the recombinant protein, a phenomenon noticeable when different proteins are being produced in the same host strain/expression system combination under identical production conditions (Fig. 1). For example, the production of hFGF-2, a protein partly produced as soluble protein and partly in form of inclusion bodies, leads to a strong impact on bacterial growth ( [14][15][16], Fig. 1a). On the other hand, production of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), mainly produced as soluble protein in E. coli, impairs bacterial growth only marginally (Fig. 1b). Although this protein is produced in larger amounts at identical conditions compared to hFGF-2, production of GFP leads to a less severe decline of growth and metabolic activities (Fig. 1). \n\nTo distinguish if recombinant protein synthesis and/ or transcription of the recombinant gene are responsible for the growth inhibitory effect a set of modified expression vectors was constructed. All expression vectors carried a gene encoding a recombinant protein (hFGF-2 or GFP) with the original T7-based production vectors containing in front of the target gene the T7 promoter and a ribosome binding site (RBS). One set of expression vectors was modified in such a way that transcription of the recombinant gene was allowed by IPTG addition but translation into the protein product omitted by removal of the RBS. In a second set of expression vectors the promoter region was removed to prevent transcription of the recombinant gene. And in a third set of expression vectors the promoter region as well as the RBS were removed.",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins produced in the thermoinduced \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 expression system can form aggregates in the cytoplasm, accumulate in soluble form either in the cytoplasm or the periplasmic space, or be secreted to the supernatant [7,65,125,149]. The site of protein accumulation depends on proper localization signals [125]. Production of recombinant proteins in the periplasmic space offers several advantages, such as decreased proteolytic activity compared to the cytoplasm, simpler purification protocols as fewer host proteins are present in the periplasm, and minimum amounts or even absence of undesirable isoforms and posttranscriptional modifications. Furthermore, the in vivo cleavage of the signal peptide provides authentic N-terminus of the target protein without an extra methionine). Another advantage is that correct formation of disulfide bonds can be facilitated because the periplasmic space provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm [14,125]. Until now, few examples of soluble recombinant protein expression in periplasm using the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system have been reported [125,142]. \n\nThe increased temperature and high production rates alter protein folding, which in turn favors protein aggregation into inclusion bodies (IB) when using the \u03bbpL/ pR-cI857 system [65,137,149,150]. The factors that determine IB formation include the nature of the protein expressed (v. gr., protein sequence), growth and induction conditions, cytoplasmic reducing environment, kinetic competition between aggregation and folding, high local protein concentration, inappropriate interactions with in vivo folding chaperones, intermolecular disulfide crosslinking (although proteins lacking cysteines can still form inclusion bodies), medium composition, and bacterial strain [137,[150][151][152][153]. Accumulation of the recombinant protein in IB has certain advantages, as it can be isolated and concentrated by a simple centrifugation step, reducing the downstream processing costs and facilitating the production of toxic proteins to cells [154][155][156].",

This protein size is same as the size of spmoB recombinant protein reported by Balasubramanian et al. (2010). \n\nThe spmoB activity in E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformant was also assayed. Bacterial cells cultivated after 24 h IPTG induction in LB medium were used. The activity of the recombinant strain was 0.114 mmol/mL culture.h. For the E. coli BL21 (DE3) non transformant, no product was found during the detection of spmoB activity. This control experiment confirmed that the observed monooxygenase activity in the recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) was due to the cloned enzyme. The spmoB activity has not been optimal yet. This was presumably due to the strong promoter of T7 used in this study. In high level expression, rapid intracellular protein accumulation and expression of large proteins increase the probability of aggregation and leads to protein instability (Jonasson et al., 2002;Palomares et al., 2004). These buildups of protein aggregates are known as inclusion bodies. \n\nIn the end, our research succeeded to express recombinant protein spmoB in large quantity and it has methane oxidation activity. However, inclusion bodies was formed so purify and in vitro refolding steps have to be performed. The ability to express and purify the desired recombinant proteins in a large quantity allows for its biochemical characterization and the development of commercial goods.",

            "text": "A model suggesting that a folding intermediate is responsible for inclusion body formation has been proposed by Mitraki and King (12). Such a kinetic competition between the folding pathway and an aggregation reaction has previously been recognized as a major determinant for apparent irreversibility in refolding studies in vitro (13). Since aggregation is a second (or higher) order process, it can be much faster than first-order folding and therefore, at high protein concentrations, aggregation dominates over folding and leads to the formation of insoluble protein (14). The observation that temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutations in the tailspike protein of phage P22 increased the fraction of newly synthesized tailspike chains forming aggregates demonstrated the importance of folding intermediates in the mechanism of inclusion body formation (15). The tsf mutations prevent formation of the native protein at the restrictive temperature, but once folded at a lower permissive temperature, the mutant tailspike proteins have stabilities similar to that of the native protein. Intragenic suppressors of these mutations inhibit aggregation of folding intermediates and increase the folding efficiency of tsf mutants (16). Mutations influencing inclusion body formation were also identified for human interleukin-1\u2424, expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli (17). The mutated residues were mainly located either in a \u2424 strand or in a flexible loop. However, there was no strong correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the mutant interleukin-1\u2424 proteins and their tendency to form inclusion bodies. Another example of studies of inclusion body formation in E. coli is provided by the enzyme \u2424-lactamase (18). In the case of such an exported protein, the formation of inclusion bodies depends on the protein synthesis rate and the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide (19). High level of expression of \u2424-lactamase resulted in the accumulation of precursor chains: aggregation occurred both in the cytoplasm from the precursor and in the periplasm from the mature \u2424-lactamase. Despite the widespread reports of inclusion body formation resulting from very high level production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, there is little information on the molecular basis governing this process.",

            "text": "Aggregation of cysteine-rich proteins usually results in inclusion body formation as the reduced state in the cytoplasm makes forming the disulfide bonds difficult (which enable proper folding). A variety of methods have been reported to tackle these issues, for instance, optimizing culture and purification conditions (Kiedzierska et al., 2008), recovering and re-folding active proteins from inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015), expression in the periplasm, and many others (Ban et al., 2020). In addition to this array of strategies, in this study we have coupled two, somewhat disjoint methodologies, but when combined lead to significantly increased yields of soluble protein. \n\nFirst, we sought to reduce inclusion body formation with an autoinduction method mediated by rewiring the genetic circuitry of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) so that instead of mediating endogenous QS functions like biofilm formation, we engineered cells to induce expression of genes-of-interest. Overexpression of a recombinant protein is often accompanied by an imbalance of metabolism, often referred to as a \"metabolic burden\" (Bentley et al., 1990). In addition, the induction process is typically initiated by the addition of a bolus of inducer, which, in turn, can bring about significant transients in precursors or energy levels (Harcum and Bentley, 1993;Ramirez and Bentley, 1995;DeLisa et al., 2001a). This imposed stress could exhaust the bacterium's innate protein folding and quality control machinery, leading to improperly folded proteins that aggregate and form inclusion bodies or get targeted for degradation. By rewiring the native quorum sensing system of E. coli, we had previously developed an autonomous induction system that used QS autoinducer signals (i.e., autoinducer 2, AI-2) to guide high level expression of recombinant proteins (Tsao et al., 2010). \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, E. coli naturally secrete AI-2 that accumulates in the culture fluids as the cells grow in number.",

Therefore, refolding attempts can be undertaken directly after solubilization of the inclusion bodies. Some reports, however, claim higher refolding yields when the solubilized inclusion body proteins are purified prior to the refolding attempt [36,39,42,43]. Additional purification has been recommended when the protein of interest represents less than 2-5% of the total cell protein [26] or less than 2/3 of the total inclusion body protein [42]. The type of contaminants can also be crucial for the success of the refolding process. For example, typical non-proteinaceous contaminants of inclusion body preparations did not affect refolding yields of lysozyme, while proteinaceous contaminants, which have a high tendency towards aggregation significantly reduced refolding yields [42]. Further purification prior to the refolding attempt does not seem to be required, even at low target protein concentrations, when the solubilized inclusion body proteins are subjected to refolding conditions during size exclusion chromatography where refolding and purification can occur simultaneously [44]. All pros and cons of any further purification step have to be carefully evaluated as they cause potential protein loss and additional production costs.",

            "text": "The biosynthetic process of the hybrid non-ribosomal peptide-polyketide yersiniabactin was known to rely on the supply of salicylate, L-cysteine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH. When exogenous cysteine was fed to the culture of E. coli harboring yersiniabactin BGC and an additional set of genes (hmwp1-2) responsible for yersiniabactin precursor biosynthesis was introduced, the yersiniabactin production in E. coli was boosted to approximately 175 mg/L (Ahmadi and Pfeifer, 2016). \n\nPrecursor engineering strategy can be also employed to increase recombinant protein production by reducing unwanted by-products. One of the primary obstacles observed in high cell density cultivations of E. coli for the production of recombinant proteins is the formation of acetate, which is a byproduct caused by an excess influx of carbon during aerobic fermentation. This acetate accumulation hampers cell growth and recombinant protein formation, even at low concentrations (Waegeman and Soetaert, 2011). A number of engineering approaches have focused on minimizing acetate formation in order to enhance recombinant protein production in E. coli. When a heterologous anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase from Rhizobium etli is overexpressed in E. coli, the resulting strain had a 57% reduction in acetate formation and a 68% increase in \u03b2-galactosidase production (March et al., 2002). It is also possible to combine different strategies to reduce the formation of undesired by-products, including acetate. For example, one study found that a mutant E. coli strain containing a defective acetate pathway and an overexpressed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-encoding ppC reduced acetate and other by-product formation and produced five time more \u03b2-galactosidase activity when compared the wild type strain (De Mey et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Insoluble recombinant proteins are a major issue for both structural genomics and enzymology research. Greater than 30% of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) appear to be insoluble. The prevailing view is that insolubly expressed proteins cannot be easily solubilized, and are usually sequestered into inclusion bodies. However, we hypothesize that small molecules added during the cell lysis stage can yield soluble protein from insoluble protein previously screened without additives or ligands. We present a novel screening method that utilized 144 additive conditions to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. These selected additives are natural ligands, detergents, salts, buffers, and chemicals that have been shown to increase the stability of proteins in vivo. We present the methods used for this additive solubility screen and detailed results for 41 potential drug target recombinant proteins from infectious organisms. Increased solubility was observed for 80% of the recombinant proteins during the primary and secondary screening of lysis with the additives; that is 33 of 41 target proteins had increased solubility compared with no additive controls. Eleven additives (trehalose, glycine betaine, mannitol, L-Arginine, potassium citrate, CuCl2, proline, xylitol, NDSB 201, CTAB and K2PO4) solubilized more than one of the 41 proteins; these additives can be easily screened to increase protein solubility. Large-scale purifications were attempted for 15 of the proteins using the additives identified and eight (40%) were prepared for crystallization trials during the first purification attempt. Thus, this protocol allowed us to recover about a third of seemingly insoluble proteins for crystallography and structure determination. If recombinant proteins are required in smaller quantities or less purity, the final success rate may be even higher.",

Here, effect of expression temperature on the quality of Escherichia coli asparaginase II (a tetrameric protein) inclusion bodies was evaluated. Asparaginase was expressed as inclusion bodies at different temperatures. Purified inclusion bodies were checked for biological activities and analyzed for structural properties in order to establish a structure-activity relationship. Presence of activity in inclusion bodies showed the existence of properly folded asparaginase tetramers. Expression temperature affected the properties of asparaginase inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies expressed at higher temperatures were characterized by higher biological activity and less amyloid content as evident by Thioflavin T binding and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Complex kinetics of proteinase K digestion of asparaginase inclusion bodies expressed at higher temperatures indicate higher extent of conformational heterogeneity in these aggregates.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for the commercial production of therapeutic and industrial recombinant proteins (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004) for several reasons, including low manufacturing costs, rapid product accumulation, and well-established tools for genetic manipulation (Eiteman & Altman, 2006). Despite these advantages, overproduced heterologous proteins in E. coli often form nonproductive inclusion bodies, and fusion expression using solubility enhancer proteins as fusion partner has emerged as an efficient production strategy to overcome the inclusion body formation (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004;S\u00f8rensen & Mortensen, 2005). Currently, Shistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (Smith & Johnson, 1988), E. coli maltose-binding protein (Bach et al., 2001), E. coli N utilization substance A (De Marco et al., 2004) and E. coli thioredoxin (LaVallie et al., 1993) are the most extensively examined fusion partners (Davis et al., 1999;Nallamsetty & Waugh, 2006), but they are not free from proprietary protection upon commercial application. Moreover, the traditional solubility-enhancing fusion partner proteins are not equally effective in promoting the folding of fusion partners (Dyson et al., 2004;Park et al., 2008). In this study, we report a novel and efficient strategy for the synthesis of soluble and correctly folded hG-CSF using various E. coli stress-responsive proteins that we previously found through a proteome-wide analysis of E. coli proteins under 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (2-HEDS)-induced stress condition (Han et al., 2008). Using the six stress-responsive proteins of E. coli, we successfully produced hG-CSF with correct conformation as well as demonstrated using circular dichroism (CD).",

From already classical studies, it is well known that high temperatures impair protein folding and favour aggregation of the recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies [133,134]. Therefore, reducing the growth temperature has been a general strategy used to minimize inclusion body formation [135][136][137] that, like other strategies, has rendered moderately positive, but unpredictable and product-dependent results [107].

In spite of the many advantages of using E. coli as expression host, there are certain limitations such as upon gene over expression, recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. In order  to reduce the inclusion bodies, several strategies could be used such as regulation of the protein synthesis rate, co-expression of chaperone genes and empowering the secretion of proteins into the periplasm. However, the control rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by altering the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [9].\n\nAlthough previously it has been reported that the expression of the xylanase genes usually cannot be functionally expressed in E. coli due to some factors including the repetitive appearance of rare codons and the requirement for specific post translational modifications such as disulfide bond formation and glycosylation [51] and also it require N-glycosylation whereas E. coli can only perform simple O-glycosylation [52]. However, recently recombinant xylanase of family GH10 (XYN) from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (DSM 571) was successfully overexpressed in E. coli (strain BL21) [53].

Results: Escherichia coli cells overexpressing heterogeneous \u03b2-galactosidase are mainly composed of two subpopulations with soluble protein and inclusion bodies, respectively. Conclusion: The ratio of soluble and insoluble protein is determined by the ratio of the two cell subpopulations. Significance: Our data shed new light on the formation of the equilibrium between soluble and insoluble forms. The mechanism by which inclusion bodies form is still not well understood, partly because the dynamic processes of the inclusion body formation and its solubilization have hardly been investigated at an individual cell level, and so the important detailed information has not been acquired for the mechanism. In this study, we investigated the in vivo folding and aggregation of Aspergillus phoenicis \u03b2-d-galactosidase fused to a red fluorescence protein in individual Escherichia coli cells. The folding status and expression level of the recombinant \u03b2-d-galactosidase at an individual cell level was analyzed by flow cytometry in combination with transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. We found that individual E. coli cells fell into two distinct states, one containing only inclusion bodies accompanied with low galactosidase activity and the other containing the recombinant soluble galactosidase accompanied with high galactosidase activity. The majority of the E. coli cells in the later state possessed no inclusion bodies. The two states of the cells were shifted to a cell state with high enzyme activity by culturing the cells in isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside-free medium after an initial protein expression induction in isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside-containing medium. This shift of the cell population status took place without the level change of the \u03b2-d-galactosidase protein in individual cells, indicating that the factor(s) besides the crowdedness of the recombinant protein play a major role in the cell state transition. These results shed new light on the mechanism of inclusion body formation and will facilitate the development of new strategies in improving rec",

However, if proteins are folded incorrectly, they tend to accumulate as aggregates in the bacterial cell and, in order to avoid toxic effects on the host system, the bacteria store these aggregates in confined structures referred to as inclusion bodies.\n\nFormation and accumulation of heterologous proteins as inclusion bodies is a common problem in protein expression. The exact mechanism of this process is still not understood. It has been suggested that factors such as culture pH, temperature and protein amino acid composition might affect the solubility of a recombinant protein [24]. The data reported here indicate that the expression Impact of bacterial growth stages on protein solubility Figure 2 Impact of bacterial growth stages on protein solubility. The expression of the three recombinant proteins was induced at various timepoints chosen gradually from low OD A 600 to higher OD A 600 . The comparison of the soluble and insoluble fractions of the recombinant proteins revealed that after initiation of expression at an OD A 600 of greater than 2.0, the recombinant proteins are found almost completely in the soluble fraction. The amount of each protein loaded is not proportional to the size of the cultivation.\n\nspeed and, with that, the subsequent folding process is the most important factor. Protein expression at the post-log phase resulted in high amounts of soluble protein, which indicates that at this stage the low bacterial growth rate implicates a biosynthesis process that is kept at low speed. The slow synthesis process will allow the protein processing machinery to efficiently assemble the freshly synthesized peptides into the correct structure. Correctly folded proteins are most likely to stay in the soluble form provided that the molecule does not contain large numbers of hydrophobic residues.\n\nAlthough we found that the pH value of the growing culture is influenced by the amino acid composition of the expressed polypeptide, keeping a stable pH value in the bacterial culture does not affect the protein solubility (data not shown) and, therefore, has little influence on the quality of the expressed protein. However, temperature is an important factor to consider. Keeping the culture at 16\u00b0C before and after induction slightly improves the protein quality (data not shown), but, on the other hand, slows down bacterial growth considerably and therefore",

At the same time, considering that an excessive IPTG concentration will promote the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli and that a too high IPTG concentration can also exhibit strong toxicity against E. coli cells, we finally determined the optimal concentration of the cell inducer IPTG of r-EchAV expression to be 100 M for subsequent large-scale bacterial culture, induction of expression, and preparation of recombinant proteins. \n\nThe experimental identification results of optimal temperature control during r-EchAV-induced expression are shown in Fig. 2B. The IPTG-induced expression of recombinant E. coli was carried out under the control conditions of 37, 30, and 25 \u00b0C, respectively. Our studies have shown that under the above temperature conditions, r-EchAV expression products could be achieved efficiently and in large quantities; the target recombinant protein expression products were found in both the isolated supernatant and the bacterial inclusion bodies, and the yield of the expressed products was not significantly different. Considering that the formation of E. coli inclusion bodies is positively correlated with the temperature, reducing the temperature during induction will help to reduce the formation of bacterial inclusion bodies, so we finally controlled the temperature during the induction of r-EchAV at 25 \u00b0C and used it as the optimum temperature for the later large-scale E. coli culture and r-EchAV preparation.",

E. coli is one of the preferred hosts of choice for the preparation of therapeutic proteins because of its simplicity, fast growth, and low-cost fermentation process [15,16]. The soluble expression of functional HSA in E. coli is the major difficulty for investigators. In earlier attempts, rHSA was expressed in E. coli but the majority of the protein expressed is insoluble, in the form of inclusion bodies [17,18]. It is known that the majority of the overexpressed proteins that have hydrophobic patches, undergo post-translational modifications or have disulfide bonds are primarily at the risk to form such amorphous aggregates [21]. HSA is a large multidomain disulfide-rich protein and it is often difficult for a disulfide bond rich protein to fold in its functional form under the normal reducing physiological environment of the E. coli cells. \n\nIn the present study, we have targeted and eventually resolved the prime limitation associated with the negligence of E. coli as a host for rHSA production. We have developed a process to overcome an unbalanced (See figure on previous page.)

            "text": "One important limitation for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli is obtaining large amounts of soluble and functional proteins. Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within producing bacteria. The production of soluble proteins under native conditions is essential for functional and structural analyses. Therefore, many studies have focused on optimising processes in protein expression (see Peti and Page 2007). One possibility is the solubilisation of proteins from inclusion bodies, but it usually requires denaturing conditions, and the subsequent renaturing step can prove difficult. Several experimental approaches have been developed to prevent these aggregates from forming, which include the use of cold inducible expression systems (Qing et al. 2004, Thuy Le andSchumann 2007), to increase the intracellular concentration of molecular chaperones (Mogk et al. 2002), to reduce the IPTG concentration for induction (Winograd et al. 1993), to induce the expression in a late log phase culture (Galloway et al. 2003), and to lower the growth temperature of induced cultures (Schein andNoteborn 1988, Vera et al. 2007).\n\nIn previous works, we reported the isolation and biochemical characterisation of genes P5\u03b2R (Gavidia et al. 2007) and P5\u03b2R2 (P\u00e9rez-Berm\u00fadez et al. 2010), which encode progesterone 5\u03b2-reductase (P5\u03b2R). These enzymes catalyse the 5\u03b2-reduction of progesterone to 5\u03b2pregnan-3,20-dione as the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to cardiac glycosides in Digitalis species. In order to increase active enzyme yield, this study evaluated the effects of different temperatures and induction periods, and of varied initial culture densities, on the recombinant P5\u03b2R2 expression levels.",

The expression of the protein and the activity of the lac promoter is maximum at 37\u00b0C [23]. However, Optimization of temperature helps improve the nal yield, expression and solubility of the target protein. At higher temperature, the target protein is more prone to proteolytic degradation and denaturation by heat, and thus the protein accumulates as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Lowering the temperature from 37\u00b0C to about 25\u00b0C has seen to reduce the proteolytic degradation of the protein and improve the stability of the target protein [24]. Lowering the culture temperature is also seen to enhance the proper export and folding of functional recombinant proteins [25]. As seen in the case of lower concentration of IPTG induction, lower temperature helps in the proper formation of recombinant proteins by reducing their overexpression which ultimately leads the protein to the folding pathways and hence protein aggregation does not occur [26].",

            "text": "Many proteins we want to purify are completely insoluble, partially soluble, or aggregate for different reasons (Table 1). This condition can be alleviated at the expression level [16] but also poses a significant challenge during downstream purification steps requiring ad hoc strategies [17,18]. \n\nAggregation can be typically induced by the nucleation of a few proteins that form small and soluble aggregates, which serve as nucleation foci for the subsequent growth of larger insoluble aggregates. The nucleation-growth process can increase with time, temperature, protein concentration, or organic and inorganic contaminants. Notably, an extended lag phase can precede the abrupt formation of large insoluble aggregates [19]. \n\nAggregation of recombinant proteins can start already during expression and may produce both inclusion bodies (IB) and soluble aggregates. Several options have been proposed to limit this problem [16][17][18][19][20][21]. These include the screening of different bacterial strains, decreasing culture temperature, using modified culture media or different solubility-enhancing fusion proteins such as maltose-binding protein, alternative expression systems such as baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells, mammalian or cell-free expression, constructs with either amino-or carboxyl-terminal deletions, expressing homologs of the protein of interest, removing flexible loops or residues that affect solubility, and refolding of denatured proteins. \n\nThe quality of the overexpressed product must be evaluated by monitoring the ratio between monomeric and aggregated protein step-by-step in small-scale expression and purification tests coupled to SDS-PAGE and analytical gel filtration [22]. Conditions must be determined that lead to a minimal presence of aggregates (both soluble and insoluble) and maximal yield of the native target protein with the correct oligomeric conformation [17,18]. \n\nAlthough protein solubility during expression is an essential prerequisite before purification, this does not prevent aggregation problems from arising at later stages of the protein production process. In general, factors such as buffer composition, pH value, kosmotropes, or chaotropes should be screened (see Fig. 5).",

            "text": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein 64 (MPT64) is an extracellular protein that is specifically released by the M. tuberculosis complex and employed as a detectable antigen for tuberculosis diagnosis utilizing a rapid test kit including a particular antibody [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nIn the current study, MPT64 was generated in E. coli as a recombinant protein that was tag-free for protein purification. It should be emphasized that E. coli also manufactures other intracellular proteins in addition to our target protein. The expressed proteins in E. coli can comprise up to 50% of the total cellular protein. Hence, purification is more difficult since recombinant proteins are mostly synthesized inside the cells [6]. Moreover, inclusion bodies are frequently formed when recombinant protein molecules aggregate during high-level production in E. coli [7][8][9]. Large-scale recovery of bioactive proteins is a significant difficulty due to inclusion body formation in bacterial hosts. It takes a lot of work to extract bioactive proteins from inclusion bodies, and the yields of recombinant proteins are frequently poor [10]. The intended protein is frequently expressed at a high translational rate when high temperatures, high inducer concentrations, and strong promoter systems are used during protein production. As a result, the bacterial protein quality control mechanism becomes completely depleted, and the partly folded and improperly folded protein molecules clump together to form inclusion bodies [11]. Therefore, in order to obtain pure antigens, the secreted MPT64 protein needs to be separated. E. coli recombinant protein manufacturing and purification is frequently accompanied by pricy and challenging processes, particularly for medicinal proteins [12]. The production and purification of recombinant proteins are crucial processes, particularly for obtaining pure antigens. A pure protein can be prepared as an antigen using a variety of purifying techniques. Upstream production and downstream purification are two typical distinct processes.",

            "text": "As high recombinant protein production does implement changes in cell physiology, it is known that there is a decreased growth rate over the duration of induction time [32]. Also biomass formation does suffer from protein induction as it has been referred that biomass yields decrease over induction time, especially when compared to mock strains [33]. Helping to optimize feeding strategies, the term q s has been introduced, determining specific sugar uptake rates, per gram biomass in certain time intervals [31]. Within this study, it was also shown that a stepwise increase, such as a q s -ramp, is superior to a constant feeding profile in Pichia pastoris protein production. The influence of q s ramps onto inclusion body formation was performed by Reichelt et al. [34]. Within this study also the term \"q s,crit \" was determined, describing the maximum physiological substrate uptake rate. It was shown within this study, that the physiological feeding rate in E. coli is highly dependent onto process parameters and consists of a rather \"dynamic nature\". Physiological capacities decline during induced bioprocesses leading to substrate accumulation [35]. \n\nIn this study, we followed the hypothesis that the specific substrate uptake rate may be a suitable process parameter to steer IB CQA, such as IB size. We performed cultivations with a E. coli BL21(DE3) strain, producing a recombinant pharmaceutical protein coupled to a N-pro-fusion protein [36], expressed exclusively as an IB with the goal to control inclusion body size within the cells based on physiological feeding. Optimized process parameters for temperature (T) and pH were used throughout the whole work, derived in from a different previous study. The specific substrate feeding rate (q s,C ) was adapted using glycerol and glucose and responses onto IB bead size were analyzed. Usage of glycerol as media is comparable cheap and since glycerol is regarded as a waste product [37] it might find further applications in future manufacturing. The degree of reduction on glycerol is slightly higher when compared to glucose and titer based productivity seemed to be positively influenced using glycerol as a primary carbon source [38].",

A low yield of soluble proteins was obtained when MICA, anti-MICA scFv and IL-23p19 were expressed in E. coli, whereas proteins in inclusion bodies represented more than 90% of recombinant proteins (Fig. 1). Attempts in protocol optimization, including changes in culture temperature, IPTG concentration or induction time were unsuccessful to obtain soluble proteins. However, we could effectively purify these proteins from inclusion bodies (data not shown), and decided to optimize protein expression from this compartment. Optimization was first carried out by selecting the most appropriate operating space for each protein. For MICA and anti-MICA scFv, previous experiments showed that the operating space lies between 3-6 h (post-induction time) and 0.1-1 mM IPTG, which were used in the present designs. In the case of IL-23p19, a range of 3-5 h (post-induction time) and 0.2-1 mM IPTG was applied for protein expression. \n\nOptimization of anti-MICA scFv, MICA and IL-23p19 production in inclusion bodies in E. coli using response surface methodology. We developed a model to determine optimal bacterial culture temperature, IPTG concentration and post-induction time using response surface methodology (RSM). This technique is useful when a response of interest, in this case protein concentration, is dependent on several independent factors 19 . The design matrix was generated using RcmdrPlugin.DoE in a R environment. Table 1 shows detailed information on the design matrix, including coded and actual variables for each run. For each protein, the expression values obtained were analyzed by RSM, which retrieved the following equations: where Y is the response variable (protein in \u00b5g/mL, in eluate), A refers to post-induction temperature, B refers to post-induction time, and C represents IPTG concentration. The yield for each protein varied significantly, as displayed in Table 2, with IL-23p19 showing the greatest protein concentration. More importantly, every protein data point was fitted with different models and particular optimal conditions could be determined.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the absence of DnaK and GroEL in E. coli mutants significantly reduces bacterial growth [161]. Absence of DnaK results in larger IB, whereas a deficiency of GroEL reduces aggregation and favors soluble protein formation, with the concomitant production of smaller and numerous IB [155]. This has been explained as a combined consequence of a less efficient folding and impaired rescue (removal) of aggregates [161]. \n\nInterestingly, expression systems that are not based on heat induction have exploited phenomena present in the heat inducible expression system to improve various aspects of recombinant protein production. For instance, chaperones like DnaK/J or DnaK/J-GrpE/ClpB have been co-expressed to facilitate disaggregation and refolding of the recombinant protein of interest [162,163]. Likewise, the co-expression of GroEL/S with heterologous proteins such as zeta-crystallin [164] and carbamoylase [165] has significantly enhanced the yield of soluble proteins. Other examples include the co-expression of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones to increase the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, or the overexpression of DnaJ to increase soluble transglutaminase content [166,167]. Overexpression of all such chaperons naturally occurs during thermoinduction of heterologous protein. Accordingly, the knowledge gained on the molecular and physiological events that occur during recombinant protein production by the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system can be of great value to control and improve not only this expression system but others as well.",

            "text": "Abstract The microbial expression system (Escherichia coli) is the most widely studied host for the production of biotherapeutic products, such as antibody fragments, single chain variable fragments and nanobodies. However, recombinant biotherapeutic proteins are often expressed as insoluble proteins, thereby limiting the utility of E. coli as expression system. To overcome this limitation, various strategies have been developed, such as changes at DNA level (codon optimization), fusion with soluble tags and variations in process parameters (temperature), and inducer concentration. However, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d strategy. The most commonly used approach involves induction at low temperature, as reducing the temperature during cultivation has been reported to increase bioactive protein production in E. coli. In this study, we examine the impact of various process parameters, such as temperature and inducer concentration, as well as, high plasmid copy number vector for achieving enhanced soluble expression of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor Fab. An interaction amongst these parameters has been observed and their optimization has been demonstrated to result in expression of 30\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mg/L antibody fragment using E. coli. This case study illustrates how process optimization can contribute toward making biotherapeutics affordable.",

            "text": "However, E. coli a bacterial expression host is still a choice of system due to its well characterized genetics, rapid growth rate and use of inexpensive substrates for cultivations [11,12,13]. Many proteins of vaccine or therapeutic use are produced in E. coli using batch and fed-batch fermentation process [11][12][13][14]. It would be very useful if the optimized production as well as purification processes could be easily scaled up to an industrial scale for the bioprocess industry. Fermentation media, mode of fermentation, scale up and culture conditions are the most significant factors in a production process. Media composition especially with the essential carbon and nitrogen components is optimized to produce large amount of desired product. Fed-batch fermentation is a common technique in this regard to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins [14,15,16]. Increasing the scale of production is usually associated with reduction in the desired product yield due to the complexity associated with fermentation process. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the scaling up of laboratory scale fermentation process and apply suitable strategy in order to enhance the productivity of the desired recombinant protein on the large scale. \n\nHigh-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often accumulates as insoluble, inactive aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies in vivo [17,18,19]. Although the recombinant protein expression in the form of IBs has advantages, the inactive recombinant proteins need to be converted into soluble and correctly folded proteins [20]. The solubilization of IBs was carried out using higher concentration of denaturing agent which must be removed using refolding processes to obtain biologically active recombinant product for vaccine studies. In recent years, several refolding techniques such as rapid dilution, dialysis, diafiltration, high pH solubilization and on column refolding using chromatographic techniques have been used for recovery of bioactive recombinant proteins [17,20,21,22]. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has emerged as a powerful technique for purification of recombinant proteins [22].",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production with Escherichia coli is usually carried out in fed-batch mode in industry. As set-up and cleaning of equipment are time- and cost-intensive, it would be economically and environmentally favorable to reduce the number of these procedures. Switching from fed-batch to continuous biomanufacturing with microbials is not yet applied as these cultivations still suffer from time-dependent variations in productivity. Repetitive fed-batch process technology facilitates critical equipment usage, reduces the environmental fingerprint and potentially increases the overall space-time yield. Surprisingly, studies on repetitive fed-batch processes for recombinant protein production can be found for yeasts only. Knowledge on repetitive fed-batch cultivation technology for recombinant protein production in E. coli is not available until now. In this study, a mixed feed approach, enabling repetitive fed-batch technology for recombinant protein production in E. coli, was developed. Effects of the cultivation mode on the space-time yield for a single-cycle fed-batch, a two-cycle repetitive fed-batch, a three-cycle repetitive fed batch and a chemostat cultivation were investigated. For that purpose, we used two different E. coli strains, expressing a model protein in the cytoplasm or in the periplasm, respectively. Our results demonstrate that a repetitive fed-batch for E. coli leads to a higher space-time yield compared to a single-cycle fed-batch and can potentially outperform continuous biomanufacturing. For the first time, we were able to show that repetitive fed-batch technology is highly suitable for recombinant protein production in E. coli using our mixed feeding approach, as it potentially (i) improves product throughput by using critical equipment to its full capacity and (ii) allows implementation of a more economic process by reducing cleaning and set-up times.",

            "text": "These antibody fragments show better tissue penetration and are less immunogenic to the human body in comparison to the full antibody. Recently, ESETEC secretion technology (Wacker Biotech) has been developed to secrete recombinant products into the culture broth during fermentation and resulted in a high yield of Fab (exceeding 4.0 g/l) and of scFv (up to 3.5 g/l) (Gupta and Shukla, 2017b). In another study, it was shown that the optimization of antibody fragment production was accompanied by the alleviation of stress production in the periplasm of E. coli. Thus, the monitoring of stress responses could be used to facilitate enhanced recombinant protein production yields (Baumgarten et al., 2018). Overexpression of membrane protein in E. coli may lead to toxicity and low yields of the active protein product. Snijder and Hakulinen (2016) described the challenges associated with overexpression of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins and different approaches to overcoming these challenges as well as a detailed protocol to express and screen membrane proteins using a His-specific fluorescent probe and fluorescent size-exclusion chromatography. Strategies for the production of soluble recombinant proteins using E. coli were described in another study (Gurramkonda et al., 2018). The latest advances in recombinant protein expression in E. coli were also described recently (Rosano et al., 2019). \n\nCRISPR/Cas9 has been used to successfully carry out the chromosomal integration of large DNA into E. coli and was also able to integrate functional genes in diverse E. coli strains (Chung et al., 2017). In a recent study, it was also reported that CRISPR-Cas9-assisted native end-joining editing offered a simple strategy for efficient genetic engineering in E. coli (Huang et al., 2019). The existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in bacteria were also described in a recent review (Vento et al., 2019).",

            "text": "E. coli has been the chief bacterial host for the production of recombinant proteins with commercial and medical significance. A kaleidoscopic variety of genetically engineered hosts, expression vectors, and expression strategies have made this process significantly convenient [25,26]. Intracellular protein expression has been in widespread use, albeit complicated by hurdles including inclusion body formation [27], protein degradation due to protease release, and liberation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), demanding cumbersome downstream procedures such as denaturation and refolding [28], endotoxin removal [29,30] and successive steps of protein purification [31]. Extracellular protein production seems to be promising as it has the potential to circumvent the need for breaking open the cells, to enhance protein purity, and to pave the way for the large-scale industrial protein production [13]. We envisioned that the T1SS and the T2SS secretory pathways of E. coli would be suitable for the production of recombinant PF4. Several factors contribute to the superiority of recombinant protein secretion in E. coli over the conventional cytoplasmic expression. Target proteins are sequestered away from a variety of  destructive proteases through protection by the components of the secretory machinery. SecB, as a pivotal component of the type II secretory pathway, grabs onto and holds the target protein in a semi-folded conformation thus retaining their competency for the post-translational translocation through the inner membrane into the periplasmic space, thereby preventing protein aggregation [32]. Based on previous studies indicating the dependency of the pelB signal sequence on secB to direct protein secretion [18], we speculate that coexpression of the secB protein may also improve the secretion level of rPF4 via type II secretory pathway by augmenting the T2SS machinery through providing surplus of secB proteins, compensating for the rate-limiting amount of secB at disposal. Furthermore, based on our observations, in the case of toxic recombinant proteins, the secB protein sequesters the target proteins and diminishes their toxicity to a large extent (unpublished data).",

            "text": "Proteins are vital for virtually all biological processes and recombinant protein production is indispensable for structural and functional characterization as the native expression does not yield sufficient amount of proteins for these studies. Moreover, protein stability and yield are important prerequisites in a wide range of applications including increasing number of therapeutic applications such as monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, cytokines and hormones [1,2]. \n\nExpression of recombinant proteins is hampered due to their poor solubility in heterologous hosts. Intracellular misfolding and poor solubility leads to inclusion bodies formation in bacteria which are submicron size species. [3] Sometimes inclusion bodies based protein expression is deliberate mainly to boost the recombinant protein production [4] or reduce the toxicity of target protein to the host [5]. Some protein-based drugs are also packaged in inclusion bodies [6]. However most of the time recombinantly produced protein are required to be soluble and fully folded. For this purpose, several N-terminal fusion tags like Maltose Binding protein (MBP), trigger factor (TF), Thioredoxin (TRX), transcription termination/antitermination (NusA), Ubiquitin protein (UB), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) have been used to improve the solubility of protein in heterologous prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts [7]. Use of SUMO fusion have been reported to increase protein yield, solubility, and purification in prokaryotes [7,8]. \n\nProtein based pharmaceuticals are one of the innovator pharmaceuticals and promise multibillion dollar industry in the health sector [9]. Protein aggregation, however cause major economic and technical burden on pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as protein based pharmaceuticals products are facing major challenge due to their aggregation over the time, since inherently proteins tend to aggregate [10]. Protein aggregation is a process during which misfolded proteins accumulates into insoluble agglomerates. In order to be functional, proteins should be fully folded. Therefore, if the protein of interest to be used as a therapeutic product, should have long term stability.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a preferred microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is mainly used for cloning, genetic modification, and small-scale production, and the mechanisms of these processes have been thoroughly studied. E. coli has been widely used in the studies of heterologous medicinal proteins because of its clearly defined genetic background, fast reproduction, low cost, high expression level, stable 2 H/ 13 C/ 15 N isotope labeling technology, and wide range of applications (Nuc and Nuc, 2006). However, as a prokaryote, E. coli has no regulatory mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression and it lacks the ability to catalyze posttranslational modifications (PTMs), especially modifications catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which severely limits its application as a recombinant drug factory. PTMs play important roles in the folding, processing, stability, glycosylation, final biological activity, and immunogenicity of the proteins. A previous study has shown that transfer of the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni to E. coli may produce glycosylated proteins (Wacker et al., 2002). Deficiency of the E. coli expression system for pharmaceutical protein production was overcome by a series of optimization strategies, such as codon optimization (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008), vector construction (Hayashi and Kojima, 2008), development of a new secretion system to reduce inclusion body formation (Cheng et al., 2017), and self-induction (Briand et al., 2016), to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli and to determine the best strategy. \n\nBacillus subtilis is an alternate host for the expression and secretion of heterologous proteins in some cases. Comparison with E. coli indicates that B. subtilis has strong protein secretion ability and does not easily form inclusion bodies. Moreover, B. subtilis is not pathogenic and has been used as a cell factory for producing enzymes, vitamins, and functional sugars in the expression systems for over a decade (van Dijl and Hecker, 2013).",

Escherichia coli is an easily cultured organism often used for recombinant protein production; however, the quantity obtained of a soluble, folded, and functional protein-of-interest is often undesirably low, because many proteins-of-interest aggregate to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm when overexpressed. 1 This happens because the innate E. coli proteostasis network capacity is insufficient to support the efficient folding of large quantities of a protein-of-interest as well as the endogenous proteome during bacterial cell growth. Therefore, one potentially general strategy to improve recombinant protein production is to enhance the E. coli's proteostasis network capacity to facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins during their overexpression, without compromising the folding of the endogenous proteome. 2,3 \u22127 Overexpression of select proteostasis network components, such as the molecular chaperones (DnaK), and/or co-chaperones (DnaJ and GrpE), and/or chaperonins (GroEL and GroES), either alone or in combination, effectively increases the biosynthetic yield of certain proteins-of-interest. 8\u221211 However, this approach is limited\ue0d5individual chaperones often handle specific protein substrates, 12,13 making it difficult to predict a priori a suitable chaperone system for a specific protein. \u221213 The E. coli cytosolic proteostasis network is transcriptionally regulated by the heat-shock response (HSR) stress-responsive signaling pathway. 14 \u221218 The HSR transcriptional program is controlled by the transcriptional factor \u03c332, 19 whose induction through stress has been shown to elevate the mRNA and protein levels of the majority of proteostasis network components. 20",

They play important roles in a variety of cell processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle, and their failure is consequently correlated with several diseases.\n\nWith the introduction of the DNA recombinant technology in the 1970s, proteins started to be expressed in several host organisms resulting in a faster and easier process compared to their natural sources (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Escherichia coli remains the dominant host for producing recombinant proteins, owing to its advantageous fast and inexpensive, and high yield protein production, together with the well-characterized genetics and variety of available molecular tools (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).\n\nThe recombinant protein production in E. coli has greatly contributed for several structural studies; for instance, about 90% of the structures available in the Protein Data Bank were determined on proteins produced in E. coli. (Nettleship et al., 2010;Bird, 2011). The E. coli recombinant production has also boosted the biopharmaceutical industry: 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed up to 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) were obtained using this host cell (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Walsh, 2010;Berlec and Strukelj, 2013).\n\nEscherichia coli recombinant protein-based products can also be found in major sectors of the enzyme industry and the agricultural industry with applications ranging from catalysis (e.g., washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g., vaccine development) to functional analysis and structure determination (e.g., crystallography; Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). As a bacterial system, the E. coli has, however, limitations at expressing more complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011).

            "text": "Other experimental approaches were attempted in order to optimize our strategy. For example, the expression of the fusion protein rMnP1-intein-CBD, under the control of T7 promoter, caused the formation of inclusion bodies, a drawback we tried to overcome by lowering expression levels with no remarkable results [33]. The incorporation of physical disruption methods, such as sonication and vortex, was insufficient to disaggregate inclusion bodies; consequently, the solubilisation of inclusion bodies was achieved with 4 M urea (Figure 5). Another point to consider is the proper refolding of MnP after recovering from inclusion bodies [16,17,28,35]. Currently there is no single method of refolding that fits for all proteins. The refolding of recombinant protein from bacterial inclusion bodies is still a challenge for the correct expression of proteins from any source. In this work, we did not include any additional steps for the in vitro refolding of rMnP1. It is likely that both the constitutive expression of DsbC by the E. coli host and the presence of DDT during the self-cleavage step promote the refolding of MnP1, since the purified enzyme was active. Hence, our strategy can be refined if combined with other improvements. For example, the production of a recombinant MnP in E. coli was favoured by the presence of calcium and hemin during in vitro refolding, generating an active enzyme with similar properties to those of the native MnP [17,28]. Furthermore, a recent work presented a strategy where the co-expression of a combination of chaperones, alongside the expression of DsbC, allowed production of a soluble form of recombinant MnP in E. coli. However, the recombinant MnP produced still had to be subject to in vitro maturation using hemin, ATP, and an ATP regeneration system in order to help chaperones to finish their folding cycle [35]. Another strategy that could be addressed is by simultaneously decreasing the temperature of expression (16 \u2022 C) and supplementing the culture medium with four chemical additives (Triton X-100, Tween-80, glycerol, and ethanol).",

The fluorescence emission does not present significant differences at different production times. However, in general terms, it is possible to conclude that GFP activity increases at longer production times, being this effect more marked in the soluble fraction (Figure 2). Besides, it is worh mentioning that at 3 h post-induction, protein solubility reached 67%, a yield much higher than that reached in E. coli for the same protein under comparable conditions (10-18%, [34]). In this context, the potential of the system for the soluble protein production was confirmed with a difficult-to-express human catalase, which under these conditions majorly occurred at the soluble cell fraction (75%) (data not shown). On the other hand, the conformational quality, namely the ratio between protein activity and protein yield, of soluble rVP1GFP (estimated through its specific fluorescence) (Figure 5) evolved contrarily to the resulting protein amount in cells (Figure 2). This means that those conditions that favour protein solubility are those giving non-optimal results regarding conformational quality. Interestingly, such a divergence between protein yield and quality has been previously described in recombinant E. coli [29,35], but the present finding confirms this fact as a generic event.",

            "text": "A third option and collateral way to produce recombinant antibody fragments is their recovery directly from the surrounding E. coli culture medium. In general, a target protein fused to an N-terminal secretion tag can be recognized and translocated by the Sec machinery to the periplasm but it could further cross the outer membrane reaching the extracellular medium giving rise to a secretory protein. Extracellular protein expression holds several advantages over intracellular production such as the more oxidative and ample environment for effective protein folding, a higher titer of recombinant protein expression, and straightforward downstream purification process. The extracellular expression also enables the direct harvesting of proteins from the culture supernatant, sparing the procedures of cell lysis and reducing the process-related impurities, such as host cell DNA and endotoxins. Furthermore, extracellular secretion can prevent the accumulation of insoluble inclusion bodies in the cytosol or periplasm as well as the toxic effects exerted by some target proteins on the host upon their intracellular expression. The extracellular secretion can be successfully achieved by optimizing the induction starting point and by adding chemical agents that promote outer cell membrane permeability [131,148,173]. To date, the supplementation of Triton X-100 or glycine to the culture medium facilitates the extracellular secretion of target proteins from E. coli cells in periplasmic expression settings. Indeed, while glycine induces the swelling of E. coli cells and enlargement of the periplasmic space by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycans, Triton X-100 disrupts the integrity of the outer membrane [174]. In this way, a functional recombinant scFv has been efficiently recovered (2.86 mg/L) from the extracellular medium by adding 0.25% Triton X-100 [159]. An experimental setting for the efficient secretion of Fab fragments in E. coli in shake flasks has been recently described by Luo and coworkers [160].",

            "text": "There are two ways to achieve these goals: one is to develop methods for converting insoluble denatured recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein to a soluble active form; the other is to change growth conditions to make cells produce active soluble recombinant protein. \n\nRecovery of active recombinant protein from the inclusion body complexes has long been regarded as a formidable task due to the denaturation of the protein and the heterogeneous nature of inclusion bodies (29). Although general techniques for obtaining active recombinant protein from inclusion bodies have not been developed, some success has been reported (30 -32). In these cases, recombinant protein aggregates were solubilized with a high concentration of urea, or other chaotropic reagents, and followed by dialysis, to allow proper refolding of the protein structure (32). When insoluble aggregates of recombinant GST-QPc were treated with 8 M urea, about 75% of the fusion protein was solubilized. However, when the urea was removed by dialysis, more than 95% of the protein precipitated. When the remaining soluble protein was applied to a glutathione agarose gel, no protein was bound to the gel, indicating that the GST-active structure had not properly re-folded. The failure to regenerate active soluble recombinant GST-QPc from inclusion bodies by the urea-dialysis method suggests that this approach is difficult or impossible for GST-QPc fusion protein. Therefore, development of an environment conducive to production of active, soluble GST-QPc recombinant protein by E. coli was necessary if the pGEX/glutathione agarose system was to work for this investigation. \n\nChanges in cellular environments are known to increase the yield of active recombinant protein either by encouraging the cells to adopt the active conformation or by increasing the stability of recombinant proteins. Variation of media, induction conditions, and length of induction are factors that affect the cellular environments of E. coli. We systematically examined the effect of these factors on the yield of soluble recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein.",

            "text": "It is possibly for this reason that co-expression of certain recombinant proteins with supplemented E. coli chaperones does not always yield positive outcomes. For instance, de Marco and co-workers [20] reported that only 26 of the 50 target proteins that were co-overproduced with supplemented E. coli chaperones showed enhanced solubility and improved yields. Altogether, this suggests that E. coli chaperones may not be acquiescent to facilitate folding of certain recombinant proteins, especially those of eukaryotic origin. For this reason, it has been proposed that rehosting the E. coli protein folding landscape by matching chaperones and target proteins from the same species for co-expression in E. coli could improve yields and quality of recombinant proteins [3]. Since production of malarial proteins in E. coli is problematic, this approach may possibly assist. Indeed, a previous study demonstrated that the co-expression of PfHsp70 with another plasmodial protein, PfGCHI, improved the solubility and functional status of the latter [4]. In the current study we investigated the merit of the chimeric Hsp70, KPf, as a chaperone co-expression partner towards improving the quality of recombinant PfAdoMetDC produced in E. coli. Our study further investigated the effect of co-expressing PfAdoMetDC with combinations of supplemented chaperones from both E. coli and P. falciparum. Our findings indicate that supplementation of chaperones of plasmodial origin improves the quality and stability of recombinant malarial proteins produced in E. coli. We discuss our findings with respect to their application in recombinant protein biotechnology and their impact on our understanding of protein folding in E. coli.",

            "text": "Currently it is often difficult to produce disulfide bond containing proteins, especially on a large scale. This severely inhibits scientific progress in understanding a myriad of mechanistic processes and imposes limitations on the biotechnology industry for the production of therapeutic proteins. The most common route for large scale production of proteins that contain disulfide bonds involves biosynthesis in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Here there are no mechanisms for disulfide bond formation. Due to this recombinant proteins are unable to attain their native conformation and form insoluble inclusion bodies. Inclusion body refolding is a widely studied field. However, it can be costly, complex, time consuming and is often inefficient. Alternative routes for producing disulfide bonded proteins such as periplasmic expression or expression in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes also have drawbacks.\n\nCurrent systems for making disulfide bonded proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli are based on the disruption of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase and glutathione/glutathione reductase pathways present in this cytoplasm [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. We recently showed that by coexpression of a catalyst of disulfide bond formation prokaryotic disulfide bond containing proteins could be produced even without disruption of these reducing pathways [12]. Here we further develop and test this system for the production of eukaryotic proteins with multiple disulfide bonds.\n\nFor proteins with only a few disulfide bonds e.g. PhoA and AppA, we showed that the addition of a catalytic system for the formation of disulfide bonds i.e. coexpression of the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1p, increased the yields of active protein produced up to 1000-fold over the wild-type E. coli control, with yields of up to 16 mg/L of culture [12]. Furthermore, the addition of a catalyst for the formation of disulfide bonds is more effective than the removal of the reducing pathways for these proteins i.e. BL21 (DE3) pLysSR",

            "text": "In contrast, proteins expressed in E. coli at lower temperatures in the range of 18 \u2022 C to 25 \u2022 C can form aggregates in the inner membrane or periplasmic space and are released to the supernatant in soluble formation; several advantages of low temperature include reduced proteolytic activity, simpler purification protocols due to fewer host proteins, correct formation of disulfide bonds, etc. [41]. Additionally, lower temperatures can stabilize refolded enzymes and lead to lower protein expression rates, so that newly transcribed recombinant proteins have enough time to fold correctly or properly [42]. As a consequence, low temperature can enhance the refolded yield of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli and is therefore usually selected to induce the production of heterogenous proteins [43][44][45][46]. However, some previous studies have demonstrated that lower temperatures may limit bacterial cell growth by disrupting an early step in protein synthesis, which leads to low recombinant protein yields [47,48]. In our study, FtsZ protein was produced as an inclusion form after induction with IPTG at 16-37 \u2022 C (Figure 1C); the highest expression level (approximately 1 mg/mL) of FtsZ protein was obtained after induction with 0.2 mM IPTG for 5 h at 37 \u2022 C (Figure 1D). Furthermore, ultrasonic lysis of bacterial cells at 97.5 W was more effective than at 162.5 W or 227.5 W (Figure 2A-C), which may be linked to an increase in protein denaturation [49]. \n\nProper concentrations of imidazole may result in a higher purity of the eluted sample. In our work, the recombinant FtsZ protein was eluted by a solution supplemented with 500 mM imidazole, with a higher yield of 25 \u00b5g/mL and purity of >90% (Figure 2D); this result was different from those in previous studies, in which higher protein yield and purity were achieved with 300-350 mM imidazole [50,51].",

During heat-treatment, majority of mesophilic host proteins are denatured and aggregated, rendering the recombinant thermostable protein in soluble fraction [48] (see Ref. [46,Table 2]). \n\nThe recombinant catalytic subunit was purified approximately 30-fold to purity (Fig. 3A) with specific activity of 160 727 U/mg (Table 1). The effects of growth temperature (Ref. [46,) and heat-treatment temperatures on yield of the soluble protein and enzyme activity were also optimized (Ref. [46,Figs. 5 and 6]). Incubation of CCEs at either 70 or 80 \u00baC resulted in enhanced AHAS activity with the highest activity achieved after 1 h of incubation, longer treatments resulted in reduced activity. \n\nAlthough expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins, the purity of the catalytic subunit was improved considerably when it was purified by loading on DEAE and HAP columns instead of IMAC columns (data not shown), resulting in approximately 1 mg purified recombinant protein from each gram (wet weight) of E. coli cells. A typical purification of the catalytic subunit is summarized in Table 1. \n\nSince small subunit has no enzymatic activity, its purity was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of the chromatography fractions. The small subunit was expressed mostly as insoluble inclusion bodies as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown), which was expectable based on a previous report pertaining to expression of the same protein [41]. The re-solubilization of the small subunit was then achieved by purification under denaturing conditions using IMAC and subsequent on-column refolding of the denatured protein (Fig. 3B).",

            "text": "Under the regulation of strong promoters, as in numerous commercial plasmid-based vectors, heterologous proteins are typically expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. The overexpression of plasmid-encoded genes can trigger transcription of heat-shock genes and other stress responses and often result in the aggregation of the encoded proteins as inclusion bodies [1]. The formation of inclusion bodies offers distinct advantages for the separation of overexpressed protein, because the aggregates that mostly contain the product in a high concentration can be easily isolated [2]. However, the recombinant proteins found in inclusion bodies are often in a misfolded state, methods that can be used to avoid aggregation to yield a soluble and active product are sometime very desirable. To improve the expression of soluble recombinant proteins, introducing a fusion partner (tag) such as N-utilization substance A (NusA), maltose-binding protein (MBP), thioredoxin (TRX), or glutathione S-transferase (GST), to the recombinant protein is one of the most commonly used methods to increase solubility [3,4]. We previously constructed two double-tagged gene fusions for overexpressing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (GlcNAc 2-epimerase) and N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid aldolase (Neu5Ac aldolase), two sequential enzymes in the production of sialic acids. Both proteins were tagged with GST at the N-terminus, but at the C-terminus, one was tagged with five contiguous aspartate residues (5D) and the other with five contiguous arginine residues (5R) [5]. The fusions were so designed to yield fusion proteins having charged surfaces at working pH, which allowed isolation and immobilization in a single step with either an anionic or a cationic exchanger that electrostatically bound fusion proteins via the 5D or 5R tag. In contrast to overexpressed GST alone that was totally soluble, however, most of overexpressed fusion proteins were in insoluble fraction.",

            "text": "One of the major challenges during expression screening is the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. These often contain large quantities of active protein, leading to strong GFP signals that cannot be distinguished from the homogeneous fluorescence of soluble proteins during FACS. This issue could be addressed by including a biosensor for inclusion body formation. The transcriptomic response to inclusion body formation has been investigated, and offers multiple starting points (Baig et al., 2014). The expression of a second fluorescent marker in the presence of inclusion bodies would allow such cells to be excluded, resulting in the specific gating of cells expressing soluble recombinant proteins. \n\nWe confirmed that V. natriegens is a suitable host for recombinant protein production, especially in the case of uricase. Although, uricases from other species have been produced successfully in E. coli (Nakagawa et al., 1995;Shaaban et al., 2015), this is not the case for L. sericata uricase and we were similarly unable to identify any E. coli clones that produced this enzyme in significant amounts. In contrast, V. natriegens produced large amounts of the enzyme in a soluble form. \n\nWe found that many of the functional elements in E. coli expression constructs could also be used in V. natriegens, including the ssYahJ secretion signal. Most of the lucimycin product was detected in the V. natriegens periplasmic fraction, and the presence of an additional smaller product indicated the cleavage of the secretion signal (Figure 6A). In E. coli, proteins fused to thioredoxin can be released from the cytoplasm by osmotic shock (Ajouz et al., 1998), but it is unclear whether this also occurs in V. natriegens. We expected to detect most of the Trx-uricase fusion protein in the periplasm (Figure 7) so it is unclear why the same fusion protein combination leads to the periplasmic localization of lucimycin. The abundance of insoluble uricase indicates incomplete or incorrect folding of the large fusion protein.",

            "text": "We have recently shown that the addition of glycine to the culture medium improves the secretion of recombinant proteins in E. coli because it increases the permeability of the E. coli cell membrane [15]. Thus, glycine should also influence the diffusion of cyclodextrins across the E. coli cell membrane, thereby augmenting their ability to influence protein production. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, both total soluble \u03b3-CGTase activity and cell growth decreased when the concentration of glycine increased from 0 to 10 g\u2022L \u2212 1 . However, the ratio of extracellular \u03b3-CGTase activity to the total soluble \u03b3-CGTase activity increased, in both control cultures (from 71.7 to 97.0%) and cultures supplemented with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (from 56.3 to 91.8%). More importantly, the effect of \u03b2-cyclodextrin on total soluble \u03b3-CGTase activity, as a multiple of the control value, increased from 1.98-fold (5.61 vs 2.83 U\u2022mL \u2212 1 ) to 2.97-fold (3.17 vs 1.17 U\u2022mL \u2212 1 ) as the glycine concentration increased. Thus, the increase in E. coli cell membrane permeability mediated by glycine did appear to enhance the diffusion of \u03b2-cyclodextrin into these cells, but this effect was second to the detrimental effect of glycine on cell growth and protein production. \n\nThe effect of the induction conditions on \u03b3-CGTase production by E. coli Temperature Induction temperature is an important parameter for recombinant protein production in E. coli. In previous studies of the production of recombinant \u03b1-CGTase, pullulanase, arginine deiminase and glutamate decarboxylase, we have shown that temperature has important impacts on both cell growth and recombinant enzyme production. In general, induction at lower temperatures increases the solubility of the recombinant proteins by preventing the formation of inclusion bodies.",

            "text": "Other workers have shown that the growth of transformed cells under a decreased growth temperature resulted in an increase in the yield of native, soluble protein [14,15]. It has been reported that cold shock can result in the production of CspA, the major cold-shock protein of E. coli, which is an RNA chaperone, preventing RNA from forming stable secondary structures for efficient translation of mRNAs at low temperature [13,16]. Also a direct consequence of temperature reduction is the partial elimination of heat-shock proteases that are induced under overexpression conditions [17][18][19][20][21][22]. \n\nAlso folding failures of about 60% recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is generally attributed to a limitation in the cell concentration of folding supporter elements, which cannot process the newly synthesized aggregation prone polypeptides. This assumption is physiologically supported by the overexpression of chaperone genes, in particular of chaperone genes from the heatshock protein family, in response to recombinant protein overproduction [23][24][25]. We therefore developed a meth-od that involved induction of expression of recombinant proteins under changing temperature conditions and using rich broth that contain glycerol (4% v/v) with low aeration (see material and methods). Also, before induction, the cultures were cooled to required temperature followed by induction and incubation of cultures at low temperature with slow shaking (10 -40 RPM) to decrease aeration. Andersen and Meyenburg [26] suggest that aerobic growth of E. coli in batch cultures is limited by the rate of respiration and the concomitant rate of ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation [26]. The addition of glycerol (4% v/v) led to a decrease in concentration of nascent polypeptide. We found that expression of 38 recombinant protein MBP or TrxA tagged at 37\u02daC in presence of 4% glycerol resulted in the production of soluble momomeric recombinants protein as shown by native PAGE analysis.",

            "text": "Another effective factor in the expression of recombinant proteins is the conditions of bacterial cultures. Researchers use shake flasks for the optimization of growth conditions. These shake flasks do not require any special instruments (Ladner et al. 2019). However, unlike bioreactors, standard cultivation of E. coli in shake flasks is done in batches. Batch growth in flasks has several limitations such as lack of pH control, low aeration, and nutrient shortage (Weuster-Botz et al. 2001). In aerobic cultures, oxygen supply is vital. Under oxygen-restricted conditions, the metabolism of a microorganism is substantially altered, and unwanted by-products like organic acids such as acetate and ethanol may be composed (Losen et al. 2004). In E.coli, high cell density followed by the formation of acetate leads to toxicity during the culture period. Controlling oxygen levels can greatly control toxicity (Johnson et al. 2010). Acetate production and its toxicity can be solved by continuously feeding the culture with glucose and maintaining the growth rate, especially before entering the acetate production stage (Millard et al. 2021). Different types of bioreactor systems have been introduced for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in E.coli (Blunt et al. 2018;Lopes et al. 2014;Muhamad Ali et al. 2015). In one experiment, researchers used a new device (gas-vortex bioreactor) for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli and claimed their method outperformed the stirred bioreactor (Savelyeva et al. 2017). Culture conditions (such as temperature, oxygen supply, and pH) were confirmed to have a significant effect on the largescale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli (Zare et al. 2019). In one research, nerve growth factor (\u03b2-NGF) protein was heterologously produced in E. coli DE3 strain, and it was reported that the 30% dissolved oxygen and postinduction temperature of 28.5 \u00b0C were the best values to produce this protein in the bioreactor (Hajihassan et al. 2019). In another study, improved growth performance of E. coli was reported by manipulating",

            "text": "Several studies have shown that mutations in A\u03b2 may affect its rate of aggregation 8,17,22,[38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] . The aim of the present study was to examine whether the aggregation propensity of A\u03b240 mutants correlates with the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli. This hypothesis was based on the notion that inclusion-body formation may be considered to be an aggregation process. \n\nSoluble unstructured peptides and small proteins may suffer from fast degradation in E. coli, preventing efficient recombinant production unless a protective tag is added. The high aggregation propensity of amyloid peptides rescues them from proteolysis and their formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli can be exploited as an advantage to enable tag-free expression of A\u03b2 peptides 29 . Moreover, the low solubility of inclusion bodies allows for repeated sonication and removal of the majority of soluble E. coli proteins to obtain a suitable starting material for ion-exchange and size-exclusion isolation of A\u03b2 with wild-type as well as mutant sequences 29 . Expression of amyloid proteins in E. coli is therefore fast, robust and inexpensive. \n\nAlthough several factors influence the quality of expression, wild-type A\u03b240 as well as most of the mutants were expressed at reproducible levels at the conditions used in this study. The amount of inclusion bodies did vary in a reproducible manner between different mutants as classified by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). The amount of inclusion bodies is likely a reflection of the aggregation propensity relative to the degradation rate of soluble species rather than the expression level. Increased inclusion body formation is found for a set of mutants with a net charge that is less negative than for wild-type: D1K, D1N, E3Q, H6R, D7N, D7K, H13R, H14R and Q15K. Following this trend, we observe reduced inclusion body formation for all mutants with a net charge that is more negative: R5Q, Q15E, K16E, K16Q, N27D, and K28Q, some of which did not show any detectable peptide in inclusion bodies after overnight expression.",

As an additional technical obstacle, proteins larger than 60 kDa are inefficiently obtained in soluble forms in E. coli [20].\n\nAs it has been well documented, bacteria overproducing either eukaryotic or prokaryotic recombinant proteins are subjected to different stresses (essentially metabolic and conformational) [21]. Under this situation, protein processing associated to cell stress responses might render non useless products, mainly because of lack of solubility, and many protein species deposit in high amounts as protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) [22][23][24][25]. By adjusting media composition, growth temperature, inducer concentration, promoter strength and plasmid copy number, variable amounts of the target protein can be forced to appear in the soluble form [26,27], although unfortunately, many eukaryotic proteins are exclusively found trapped in IBs and seem to be resistant to processbased solubility enhancement. While IBs formed by enzymes can be efficient catalysers in enzymatic reactions [28][29][30][31][32], pharmaceutical proteins need, in contrast, to be dispersed as soluble entities to reach their targets at therapeutic doses. IBs essentially contain the recombinant protein in variable proportions (from 60 to more than 90%) and some contaminants as chaperones, DNA, RNA and lipids [33]. Although stored protein can be released from IBs using denaturing conditions, in vitro refolding processes are not as effective as expected [34] and other expression systems should be tried. In some cases, recombinant proteins have been successfully purified from IBs as for example Betaferon [35] and insulin [36]. However, for non integral membrane proteins, cytosolic and/or soluble protein domains, the probability of success is reasonably high and E. coli should be then considered as a promising expression system [37].\n\nIn summary, around 10% of full-length eukaryotic proteins tested in this system have been successfully produced in soluble form in E. coli [38].

            "text": "There are several reports in literature citing the effect of chaperones on recombinant protein expression, solubilization and folding in E. coli based expression systems. Although there have been many experimental investigations on the effects of chaperone co-expression on aggregating recombinant proteins (Caspers et al. 1994;Mogk et al. 1999;Nishihara et al. 2000), there are very few such studies on soluble recombinant proteins (Kohda et al. 2002). Our experimental investigations, involving coexpression of major chaperone teams, found that the role played by the molecular chaperones was different for a soluble recombinant protein as compared to the literature reports on aggregation-prone recombinant proteins (which often form inclusion bodies). Kohda et al. (2002) observed that coexpression of DnaK chaperone team lead to a significantly reduced level of the active recombinant protein (glutamate racemase) and attributed this to the accumulation of partially folded intermediates due to the absence of large quantities of GroEL chaperone team. However, in the present case, the DnaK chaperone team seems to impair productivity of streptokinase even in the presence of GroEL chaperone team and this indicates that the unavailability of GroEL chaperone team suggested by Kohda et al. could not be the reason for the reduced productivity. Enhancement in the biological activity of recombinant proteins during the co-expression of folding accessories has been extensively reported (Georgiou and Valax 1996). The enhancement in the activity of the recombinant protein is generally brought about by increasing the solubility of the recombinant protein (Caspers et al. 1994;Baneyx and Palumbo 2003). However, the enhancement in the activity of highly soluble recombinant protein often results from better folding of the recombinant protein.",

Inclusion body formation is usually not toxic to the cell, the recombinant protein can be accumulated to very high levels and, in some cases, the protein is in an 'amyloid' form which entraps functional protein [4]. Bacterial inclusion bodies have been shown to spontaneously penetrate mammalian cells and can be targeted to specific receptors, opening the way to deliver functional drugs. Due to their natural abundance and the fact that Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography can be performed in denaturing conditions, IBMP can be purified in large quantities. One application is their use as an alternative to peptides for raising specific antibodies against eukaryotic proteins [5,6]. As mentioned in Section 2.1, large scale refolding of inclusion bodies has been attempted in the field of structural biology and some progress has been made especially for NMR analysis. For instance, several G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) have been produced in a functional form (after refolding of E. coli-produced inclusion bodies in amphipols [7,8])",

However, an excess of DnaK is recognized to promote functional inactivation of the target protein and eventually its massive proteolysis, at least in given experimental setting ups [13][14][15]. Protein degradation mediated by DnaK seems to be mechanistically connected to the disaggregation process on the surface of inclusion bodies (where DnaK accumulates), in which by DnaK-DnaJ, IbpA-IbpB and ClpP participate [16]. DnaK-mediated degradation of recombinant polypeptides might represent a physiological replica of \u03c3 32 inactivation, through its DnaK-mediated delivery to the protease La during the regulation of the heat shock circuits [17]. Recombinant protein production in DnaK knock out mutants, in contrast, results in high yields of recombinant protein and larger inclusion bodies [18].\n\nThe activities of GroEL, the other main cytosolic chaperone in E. coli, on recombinant protein solubility, but specially their potential side effects on protein quality are much less known. This might be due to the fact that GroEL knock out mutants are not viable [19], and that studies on partially inactivating groEL mutations [20] or truncated versions of the chaperone [21] might render non conclusive results. GroEL co-production has been shown to enhance solubility and/or yield of different proteins, at very different extents (although sometimes with no perceivable or very mild effects) and under different production conditions [22]. GroELS, apart from acting in the sequential folding steps of nascent polypeptides [23][24][25][26], is a holding chaperone that can also promote natural and recombinant protein stability and the formation of large macromolecular complexes such as tobacco mosaic virus-like particles",

EPA had been used successfully by others as immunogenic carrier protein in a chemically coupled conjugate vaccine against Shigella flexneri type 2a [2].\n\nOverexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is often associated with negative effects on host physiology, reflected in a reduced specific growth rate, reduced respiratory capacity, increased levels of alarmones and upregulated stress defence genes [35][36][37][38]. In our study we observed a considerable metabolic burden already in uninduced cells. This could be alleviated by including complex supplements in the medium. In spite of optimal, surplus nutrient supply in batch and fed-batch culture, growth was strongly inhibited after induction of oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. Growth inhibition presumably was due to stress caused by aggregated, misfolded proteins [38]. PglB is an integral membrane protein [9] and such proteins are prone to inclusion body formation and often severely affect cell physiology when overexpressed in recombinant E. coli [39]. Reduced inducer concentrations and/or lower cultivation temperature in many cases improve the expression of correctly folded \"problematic\" recombinant proteins [28,29,40]. However, in our case no significant improvements could be obtained with these strategies. The vector pEXT21 used for PglB expression is a low copy number plasmid. When fully induced with 1 mM IPTG, expression levels are as low as for a high copy number, pBR322-derived plasmid induced with only 20 \u03bcM IPTG [21]. In our experiments the use of 50, 20 and 5 \u03bcM IPTG should have reduced the expression level of PglB by 25, 60 and 90%, respectively [21]. This further reduction did not seem to have an additional positive effect compared to the reduced expression level already achieved by using the low copy number vector.\n\nThe results obtained in this study demonstrate the suitability of a vector combination with independent, tight control of PglB and carrier protein expression for efficient glycoconjugate production with E. coli. P BAD is well-known for its tight repression [31] while P tac is prone to leaky expression if LacI repressor levels",

            "text": "Since E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium, bacteriocin production can be confined to the cytoplasm where it can accumulate in a soluble form or aggregate in insoluble inclusion bodies, or can also be secreted into the periplasmic space or into the culture medium. Several factors including protein size, amino acid composition, and the type of leader peptide can affect bacteriocin translocation to these locations (reviewed in Mergulhao et al., 2004).\n\nMost bacteriocins use a dedicated secretion machinery in their natural hosts to export the bacteriocin to the extracellular media. However, the production of active bacteriocins directly to the culture medium by cloning their whole operons in E. coli has been reported on a limited number of occasions (Figure 2) (Caetano et al., 2011a;Mesa-Pereira et al., 2017). Generally, the overexpression of cloned native genes leads to bacteriocin accumulation in inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. At first glance, the formation of inclusion bodies could be advantageous as the expressed bacteriocins are inactive and protected against host proteases, facilitating their purification and a high protein yield. However, this aggregation can affect the host metabolism and additional steps (inclusion body isolation, solubilization of the aggregates, and protein refolding) are required for their purification, limiting their large-scale production (Mergulhao et al., 2004).\n\nThe processing and the correct folding of bacteriocins as well as their recovery can be simplified when the peptide is secreted into the E. coli periplasm or into the culture medium. To achieve that, signal sequences of proteins recognized by a general protein secretory pathway (sec pathway), such as the maltose-binding protein malE (Miller et al., 1998), the pectase lyase secretion signal pelB (Ingham et al., 2005), and the outer membrane protein ompA (Zhang et al., 1995), have been fused to the bacteriocin sequence for targeting their secretion to the periplasm. In addition, the bacteriocin divergicin A signal peptide has been used to direct",

            "text": "Process and product quality robustness are of utmost importance for the industry. In bioprocess development, a protein production process is usually characterized in a broad range of different process conditions (design space) and later optimized in a narrow range (control space). This can be done using a design of experiments (DoE) approach that statistically investigates how a system output variable (e.g. protein titer) changes upon the variation of a certain input variable (e.g. temperature) or a variety of input variables [1]. This approach does not only allow process development and optimization, but also robustness testing [1,2]. \n\nIn contrast to most lab-scale bioprocesses, pilot and largescale bioprocesses often apply fully digitized bioprocess monitoring and control systems. Nevertheless, unexpected equipment failures and operator errors might cause process deviations (e.g., a failure in the cooling system might cause an increase in temperature). Knowledge on the effects of these technical failures on cell and product are scarce. Recently, we have shown that an inclusion body (IB) process with E. coli BL21(DE3) is robust to temporary technical failures during the protein production phase [3]. In this followup study, we want to know how soluble protein production in the cytosol and protein quality are affected by such technical failures. In Table 1 we give an overview of the technical failures that we investigated and our hypotheses, how this might affect the bioprocess and the product [3]. \n\nWith respect to protein quality, E. coli has rather simple protein modification capabilities, like enzyme cofactor integration [8] or disulphide bridge formation in its periplasm [9]. However, spontaneous protein glycation has been reported [10][11][12]. Protein glycation is an unwanted, covalent, non-enzymatic modification that changes the physico-chemical properties of a protein and increases its size by 178 Da and/or 258 Da [11].",

            "text": "Inclusion bodies (IBs) are formed during high level expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli [1,2]. These are often localized in cytoplasm or periplasm of the expression hosts and seen as dense refractile aggregates under electron microscope [3,4]. Aggregation of proteins during high level expression is generally attributed to high local concentration of naive polypeptide chains emerging from ribosomes, inefficient folding and unavailability of chaperones [5,6]. These factors lead to the formation of partially folded or misfolded protein intermediates in cytoplasm. Usually, these intermediates have surface exposed hydrophobic patches which come together to form large, amorphous inclusion body (IB) aggregates [7]. Isolation of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies is cumbersome and needs understanding of protein aggregation behavior [8,9]. Although IBs have been characterized as amorphous aggregates, they are not merely a cluster of disordered folding intermediates [10,11]. Rather, inclusion body proteins are often enriched in b-sheet structures [12][13][14][15] and bind to amyloid specific dyes like Thioflavin-T and Congo-Red [14,[16][17][18]. Moreover, inclusion bodies have ability to seed aggregation of structurally similar proteins, a characteristic property of amyloids [14]. Aggregation leading to inclusion body formation has been reported to be very specific in nature as they mostly consist of the expressed recombinant proteins [16,19]. Size distribution of IB aggregates, as well as their other physical and structural properties depends on cultivation and induction conditions [20,21]. Reversibility of inclusion body formation [22] and existence of native-like structure of proteins in inclusion bodies has also been reported [12][13][23][24]. Besides this, there are reports suggesting the presence of biologically active protein molecules in inclusion bodies [25][26][27][28].",

            "text": "In recent years, the rapid expansion of biotechnology has lead to the production of a wide spectrum of recombinant proteins. To this end, a range of host organisms, from bacteria to mammalian cell-culture systems are being used. Even though bacteria have some disadvantages, Escherichia coli is still one of the most commonly used organisms for the production of recombinant proteins [1][2][3].\n\nThe over-expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria often leads to their aggregation into protein deposits called inclusion bodies (IBs). However, recombinant protein production is stressful for the host bacterial cell, as the whole cell machinery has to adapt to the overexpression of foreign protein [4]. Therefore, the production process has to be carefully designed [5][6][7]. Extensive studies on bacterial IBs showed that if an overall friendlier production is used, a great proportion of properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins are formed inside IBs [5][6][7][8][9]. Selection of the suitable production strain, optimization of the gene coding for the target protein, lowering the production temperature and careful design of medium composition are key factors in preparing IBs that will be composed of biologically active proteins [6,10]. Such IBs, which are made of biologically active proteins, are designated as non-classical IBs (ncIBs) [8,11].\n\nSince IBs are highly pure protein deposit (overexpressed recombinant protein may represent up to 95% of total protein content [12]), ncIBs composed from active proteins are highly attractive to biotechnology and the developing field of nano-biotechnology [9,13,14]. Such ncIBs are highly attractive for downstream isolation of target proteins, as majority of other proteins can be simply washed from IBs after their isolation from bacterial cells [5,11]. In addition, IBs possessing active proteins can be used as active protein nanoparticles, with many possible applications [5,6,13,14].\n\nHowever, in order to prepare quality active nanoparticles, both the protein production step (bacterial growth conditions) and the isolation process should be carefully optimized.\n\nIn the past, various",

            "text": "Ann example this dramatic solubilization can be observed in additive lanes B8 and B11 of Figure 2B. \n\nThough we did not test this, it may be beneficial to have additives present in both the growth medium of the E. coli and also during cell to aid in the overall solubility of the protein. If this was to be attempted, the investigator would need to ensure the additive is not toxic to the E. coli expression strain, not metabolized, and the solubilizing effect is scalable to growth cultures with different expression volumes. Variations to this have previously be attempted [37,53], but not with a wide range of proteins. \n\nOur results indicate naturally occurring osmolytes glycine betaine, proline, trehalose, and mannitol can effectively aid in the stability and solubility of recombinant proteins. Many of these additives are osmolytes, which are protein-stabilizing molecules and chemical folding chaperones in nature. Research groups are actively studying these molecules to elucidate their stabilizing effects in vitro. Most of these studies look into the biophysical stabilization and thermal protection of proteins. Little work has been done into applying these to stabilizing small molecules to protein solubilization. It has been recently reported that when added to a growth culture, trehalose and sorbitol (6-carbon polyol) helped two previously insoluble proteins appear in the soluble fraction [37]. In Prasad et al. [37] protein solubility was increased, but the protein did not appear to be fully soluble. \n\nThe general mechanism for stabilization with osmolytes is believed to be through changing the protein hydration by exclusion from the hydration layer of the protein [30,41]. The resulting change in the protein hydration increases the energy needed to denature proteins [30]. Osmolytes have been shown to increase the thermal stability of proteins resulting in a shift in the protein's melting temperature when present in the protein buffer  . SDS-PAGE gels from Prp2, which was purified in the presence of 100 mM potassium citrate. The resulting protein resulted in diffraction quality crystals.

            "text": "Folding failures of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is generally attributed to a limitation in the cell concentration of folding assistant elements, which cannot process the newly synthesized aggregation prone polypeptides. This assumption is physiologically supported by the overexpression of chaperone genes, in particular of chaperone genes from the heat-shock protein family, in response to recombinant protein overproduction [126,127,133]. Thus, coproduction of the main heat shock chaperones (specially GroEL and DnaK) together with the target protein has been largely explored as a way to minimize aggregation and to enhance the solubility of the recombinant protein product (reviewed in [140][141][142][143]). In many cases, solubility has been significantly enhanced by coexpression of individual chaperone genes, while in others an even negative effect on product stability and host viability has been observed. Selection of the suitable chaperone(s) is still a trial-and-error process. However, more recent results indicate that complete chaperones gene sets rather than individual chaperone genes with synergistic and/or cooperative activities (such as DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES sets) will lead to a more predictable improvement of target protein solubility. [144][145][146][147].\n\nInterestingly, when producing enzymes or fluorescent proteins in DnaKcells, the biological activities and therefore the conformational quality of aggregated polypeptides is much more close to that of soluble versions, compared to wild type cells [148][149][150]. Furthermore, the overexpression of the dnaK gene along with a model GFP recombinant protein dramatically reduces the specific fluorescence of a GFP fusion in both soluble and insoluble versions [151]. This indicates that DnaK directly or indirectly impairs the folding state of the aggregated proteins.\n\nIn this regard, the production of GFP variants in absence of DnaK results in highly fluorescent inclusion bodies [152]. In these cells, both the protein yield and quality were dramatically enhanced although the solubility is lower than in the wild type, as expected",

The timing of protein synthesis induction also played a critical role in the fate of the recombinant protein within the host cell, affecting protein and product yield. The study identified significant differences in the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis pathways between two E. coli host strains (M15 and DH5\u237a), with the E. coli M15 strain demonstrating superior expression characteristics for the recombinant protein.

            "text": "allows for more exible change between high-and low-demand products, less down time of unit operations, less process variability and reduced degradation of the target molecule due to less residence time in the reactor [9][10][11]. Integrated continuous operation has been demonstrated in animal cell [12,13] and even E. coli processes [14]. However, in the latter, the product is typically located inside the cell, which requires cell disruption in downstream processing, leading to release of unwanted host cell proteins and other contaminants, like lipids and DNA [15]. If the target protein is produced as insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs), additional IB processing is needed. Thus, continuous manufacturing in E. coli is still hard to realize to date. One strategy to bring E. coli to continuous manufacturing is soluble, extracellular protein production.\n\nSecretion of recombinant protein to the medium furthermore enhances solubility, stability and biological activity of the product [16]. This can be achieved either by one-step-secretion (directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space) via the T1SS or T3SS system, or by two-step-secretion: In the rst step, the protein is directed through the inner membrane via the Sec-or Tat-pathway. In the second step, the outer membrane (OM) is made permeable, or \"leaky\", to release the product to the medium [3]. Numerous studies on how to increase leakiness during cultivation exist and several reviews cover this research in detail [2,3,17].\n\nOne approach to increase leakiness is chemical permeabilization by addition of media supplements, like Triton-X, Tween or EDTA. However, those additives usually have detrimental effects on the viability of the cells and might harm the product [3]. Another approach is the generation of leaky E. coli mutants. Many expression systems that show permanently high leakiness have been engineered to date. Their outer membrane structure is usually altered by mutations in cell envelope genes and signal peptides are optimized for higher translocation e ciency [3,18,19].

Nevertheless, formation of recombinant proteins in soluble fraction (periplasmic and cytoplasmic) is favored at lower temperature [23]. In this case, the formation of recombinant protein was relatively higher at 37\u00b0C (induction period-5 h) as compared to 18\u00b0C (induction period-20 h), but a large amount of protein goes to inclusion body at 37\u00b0C (Additional file 2A-C, Table 1A). However, at 18\u00b0C most fraction of the protein remains in soluble fraction. When induced at 37\u00b0C, the amount of native (cytoplasmic or soluble) PschSOD protein, obtained with the purification procedure was~2.8 mg L \u22121 of culture volume with bacterial wet biomass was about~5 g L \u22121 , while induction at 18\u00b0C resulted in~4 mg L \u22121 of culture volume with bacterial wet biomass was about~4.5 g L \u22121 (Table 1A). Therefore, 18\u00b0C was selected for further expression study and overexpression of the protein.\n\nThe prosthetic copper and zinc are essential component of CuZn-SODs. Therefore, the effect of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) on the expression of PschSOD was investigated by exogenous supplementation of Cu (CuSO 4 ) and Zn (ZnSO 4 ) in the culture medium following induction with IPTG. The added concentration (250 \u03bcM) of each of these compounds does not interfere with the viability of bacterial cells as reflected in OD600 and CFU counting (Additional file 3: Figure S3A and B). Although, supplementation of copper has no effect on the overexpression of PschSOD in soluble form but zinc results in the increase in protein expression (Additional file 4: Figure  S4A and B, Table 1B). However, addition of copper causes a nearly 10-fold increase of SOD activity, as observed in both crude extract and Ni-NTA purified protein samples (Additional file 4: Figure S4C and D, Table 1B).

            "text": "2010). Furthermore, it has been shown that (the co-production of) variants of components involved in the protein biogenesis can also help to improve periplasmic protein production yields (P\u00e9rez-P\u00e9rez et al., 1994;Taw et al., 2021). Isolation of such variants will require cleverly designed screens or selections. Also hosts can be customized for the production of a particular Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org December 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 797334 recombinant protein in the periplasm using evolutionary and engineering approaches (Wang et al., 2009;Robertson et al., 2021;Wannier et al., 2021). It should not be forgotten that our knowledge of gene expression, protein translation, protein targeting, translocation, folding and stability is everything but complete. Furthering our knowledge in these areas may also open up new avenues for enhancing periplasmic protein production yields. Studying E. coli cells producing proteins in the periplasm using omics approaches, may help to identify components that can positively and also negatively affect periplasmic protein production yields (e.g., (Ceroni et al., 2015;Reis et al., 2019;Karyolaimos et al., 2020;Mateus et al., 2020;Tan et al., 2020;Rugbjerg et al., 2021)). Such studies may extend the repertoire of components that can be coproduced and used for the isolation of variants as well as genes that can be inactivated to enhance periplasmic protein production yields.\n\nTaken together, different strategies have successfully been used to enhance periplasmic protein production yields in E. coli and there appears to be ample room for further improvements. The more information becomes available, the easier it may become to develop predictors and other computer-aided tools that can assist in designing strategies to enhance periplasmic protein production yields (Salis et al., 2009;Orfanoudaki et al., 2017;Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019;Reis and Salis, 2020;Bhandari et al., 2021;Cetnar and Salis, 2021).\n\nFinally, we still can learn a lot from how Genente",

            "text": "Background: Bacterial expression systems remain a widely used host for recombinant protein production. However, overexpression of recombinant target proteins in bacterial systems such as Escherichia coli can result in poor solubility and the formation of insoluble aggregates, termed inclusion bodies. As a consequence, different and numerous strategies or alternative engineering approaches have been employed to increase recombinant protein production. In this case study, we present the strategies used to increase the recombinant production and solubility of \u2018difficult-to-express\u2019 bacterial antigens, termed Ant2 and Ant3, from Absynth Biologics Ltd\u2019s Clostridium difficile vaccine programme. Results: Single recombinant antigens (Ant2 and Ant3) and fusion proteins (Ant2-3 and Ant3-2) formed insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) when overexpressed in BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) cells. Further, proteolytic cleavage of Ant2-3 was observed, potentially due to the presence of a large un-structured loop between the protein boundaries. Optimisation of culture conditions such as varying the induction temperature and addition of heat-shock inducer benzyl alcohol to the growth media had no significant effect on the processing and protein production pattern for all four antigen molecules. Changes to the construct design to include N-terminal solubility tags (Thioredoxin and N utilisation substance protein A) did not improve solubility. Screening of different buffer/additives to improve stability showed that the addition of 1-15mM dithiothreitol (DTT) alone improved the stability of both Ant2 and Ant3. Structural models were generated for Ant2 and Ant3 and solubility-based prediction tools were employed to determine the role of charge and hydrophobicity on protein production. The results showed that both Ant2 and Ant3 contained unfavorable features associated with poor solubility. A large non-polar region was detected on the surface of Ant2 structures, whereas, positively charged regions were observed for Ant3.Conclusions: Commonly used strategies to enhance recombinant protein production in bacterial systems did not act to increase production of model \u2018difficult-to-express\u2019 antigens,",

In the purification process developed here only the bacteriocin encoded by orf030 gene was obtained in the soluble fraction, the other ones were recovered from the insoluble fraction. Fahnert et al. [40] reported that overexpression of recombinant proteins can be lethal for the E. coli host, yielding to inactive inclusion bodies associated with the specific folding of these proteins [40]. The formation of the inclusion bodies may be an advantage for bacteriocin purification as they can remain protected from the deleterious actions of the host proteases [36]. In addition to these two hypotheses, expression of these bacteriocins in other hosts like lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts could be advantageous. In this study, the inclusion bodies were solubilized with 4 M of urea. Urea is a chaotrope molecule that at high concentrations can lead to denaturation of the secondary structures of proteins. It is used to inhibit protein aggregation during the folding process, improving the recovery of bioactive proteins [41]. The solubilized inclusion body proteins are refolded by removal of the solubilisation agent. In this study, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was used for refolding of solubilized proteins.",

            "text": "Before initiating a protein expression project, it is essential to determine the definitive use of the recombinantly produced protein. Must the protein be soluble? Does the final product need to be active? Is the native protein conformation important? In some instances, such as antibody production, the production of soluble protein is not necessary, as the protein sequence, rather than the correct 3-dimensional fold, is required for successful antibody production (Yan et al., 2007). For these cases, expression that causes the protein to be incorporated into inclusion bodies is suggested, as the recombinant protein, while misfolded or unfolded, is highly enriched and protected from proteases (Valax and Georgiou, 1993). However, most often, the objective of recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to produce a protein product that is soluble, folded, and active.\n\nExpression in E. coli requires four elements: (1) the protein of interest, (2) a bacterial expression vector, (3) an expression cell line, and (4) the equipment/materials for bacterial cell culture (i.e., shaker/media). There are multiple parameters that can be varied when optimizing an expression protocol, from selecting a vector with the appropriate promoter, to choosing an appropriate induction temperature. With each selection affecting the solubility and activity of the protein product, this task can appear daunting. However, decades of work by individual protein chemists, coupled with the recent experiences of high-throughput structural genomics efforts, have resulted in the identification of a consensus protocol that allows a diverse set of proteins to be successfully expressed in E. coli. A flowchart of the protocol typically used by the authors to express a diverse set of proteins is shown in Figure 5.24.2 (Mustelin et al., 2005;Brown et al., 2008;Critton et al., 2008). More extensive protocols are also available (Peti and Page, 2007;Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a).\n\nThe protocol outlined in Figure 5.24.2 consists of nine steps. First, the optimal residue boundaries of the desired protein product, the \"target protein,\" are determined. The target gene is then subcloned into a bacterial expression vector that utilizes the T7 lacO",

            "text": "This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control. E. coli can produce recombinant proteins with up to 80% of its dry weight and withstand many environmental conditions [34]. Human insulin-like growth factor (hIGF-I) is a single-chain 70-residue therapeutic protein with three disulfide bonds within its structure. IGF-I affects cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the long term. E. coli promotes the production of this kind of protein through its relative ease, low cost, and accelerated high-density cultivation. Therefore, it played an important role in the pharmaceutical industry in the last decades. \n\nHowever, E. coli has several disadvantages that need to be addressed for efficient protein production. High cell densities cause toxicity owing to the deposition of acetates [35][36][37]. This can be inhibited by monitoring oxygen levels. Proteins that are generated as inclusion bodies are often inert, insoluble, and require refolding. Owing to the limitation associated with the processing of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds, it is extremely difficult to refold such proteins [38,39]. The E. coli system generates unmodified proteins without glycosylation. Hence, some of the antibodies that are synthesized do not recognize mammalian proteins [40][41][42]. Interestingly, the non-glycosylated human tPA produced in E. coli was fully active in vitro. Given the absence of glycosylation, the drug exhibited a four-fold longer plasma half-life and a correspondingly higher clearance rate in animals [43,44]. The resulting quantity constituted 5-10% of total E. coli protein.",

We envisage that our observations can be used to engineer E. coli for the improved production of recombinant secretory proteins. IMPORTANCE The bacterium Escherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. To fold properly, many recombinant proteins have to be targeted to the E. coli periplasm, but so far the impact of the targeting pathway of a recombinant protein to the periplasm has not been extensively investigated. Here, we show that the targeting pathway of a recombinant antibody fragment has a tremendous impact on cell physiology, ultimately affecting protein production yields in the periplasm and biomass formation. This indicates that studying the targeting and secretion of proteins into the periplasm could be used to design strategies to improve recombinant protein production yields.",

            "text": "There are two different coding systems for the mitochondrial genome and nuclear gene coding. According to the invariance of the sequence of the target protein sequence, the obtained COX\u2161 subunit gene was modified, synthesized and then expressed. Different expression vectors (Peasy blunt E1, pET28a, pET30a, pET32a, pET42a) were used to express COX\u2161 fusion protein. However, only pET32a-COX\u2161could be expressed recombinant protein in the E.coli Transetta(DE3) and be detected by the SDS-PAGE and WB. After removal of fusion tag with enterokinase, the monomeric form of COX\u2161 could not be visualized by WB because of the lack of anti-COX\u2161 antibodies. \n\nOverexpression of protein in heterologous systems often results in the formation of inclusion bodies [39]. In the E. coli expression system, the formation of inclusion bodies can be formed owing to the high growth rates of cell lead to the protein unfolded to form the correct conformation [40]. Therefore, improving solubility is a major goal in studying protein production processes. Recently, the use of low growth temperatures to increase soluble protein yields has been reported [41][42]. In present study, most of the COX\u2161 protein expressed in E.coli was as inclusion bodies. Therefore, various strategies have been designed to overcome this drawback. When expressed at 37\u2103, a considerable amount of the total protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was obtained, however only a little soluble protein was detected. Finally, considerable soluble protein was obtained when expressed at 16\u2103, accompanied by a reduced total protein yield. The results suggested that the conformational quality of COX\u2161 protein is significantly influenced by temperature. When grown at low temperature, COX\u2161proteins with the slow rates growth in E. coli cell have enough time to fold in the correct conformation [43]. \n\nAfter removal of fusion tag with enterokinase, UV-visible was used to characterize purified COX\u2161 active site.",

            "text": "The factors that determine IB formation include the nature of the protein expressed (v. gr., protein sequence), growth and induction conditions, cytoplasmic reducing environment, kinetic competition between aggregation and folding, high local protein concentration, inappropriate interactions with in vivo folding chaperones, intermolecular disulfide crosslinking (although proteins lacking cysteines can still form inclusion bodies), medium composition, and bacterial strain [137,[150][151][152][153]. Accumulation of the recombinant protein in IB has certain advantages, as it can be isolated and concentrated by a simple centrifugation step, reducing the downstream processing costs and facilitating the production of toxic proteins to cells [154][155][156]. However, a refolding step is then required to recover a biologically active protein, and refolding steps can be inefficient [157,158]. \n\nInduction temperature, extracellular pH, and the carbon source can either prevent or accelerate the formation of IB when employing the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system [151]. IB typically contain around 20% to 85% of recombinant protein, whereas the remainder consists of a large set of host cellular proteins, particularly hsp such as chaperones and co-chaperones [153,155,159,160], and other contaminants such as phospholipids, nucleic acids, and membrane proteins [152]. The chaperones DnaK and GroEL (together with their co-chaperones DnaJ-GrpE and GroES, respectively) have been identified as major components of IB produced in the thermoinduced system [155]. DnaK has been mostly localized on the surface of the IB, suggesting that this protein interacts with the IB after their formation [155]. In contrast, a significant fraction of GroEL has been observed within the IB, remaining trapped inside during the initial aggregation [155]. Interestingly, the absence of DnaK and GroEL in E. coli mutants significantly reduces bacterial growth [161].",

            "text": "the form of inclusion bodies. At this time, the expression strategy of E. coli was to extract inclusion body first and then refold the denatured proteins rather than secretory protein expression, and the difference in hNGF yield was dependent on the formation of inclusion bodies. They obtained 85 mg and 10-12 mg of recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) per liter of bacterial suspension before purification, respectively. However, 87% of the hNGF protein was lost during the purification process, which may indicate that the folding of hNGF folding is not entirely correct [30]. In 2001, Anke et al. [28] continued the method of extracting proteins from inclusion body, but changed the host strain to DE3, which is more commonly used by later researchers. The important role of pro-sequence in facilitating the folding of NGF in inclusion body is also demonstrated. Anke et al. verified that pro-sequence mediates protein entry into the endoplasmic reticulum and significantly increases the yield and rate of disulfide bond formation. Although protein production through inclusion body can ensure high protein yield, it is difficult to extract and purify protein in the later stage, involving disulfide bond formation and protein refolding [30,31]. The inclusion bodies located in the cytoplasm are particularly susceptible to degradation. An improved strategy was to produce NGF in the periplasmic space, where the protease content of protease is lower and disulfide bond forming enzymes can catalyze correct disulfide bond formation [32,33]. Different signal peptides are used for subcellular localization and increase in expression of recombinant proteins. Kilmon tried different N-terminal sequence of trp L and \u03b2-lactamase signal peptide, and it was found that the former achieves better expression of NGF [31]. Tilko used DsbA signal sequence, which is a disulfide bond forming enzyme, to express recombinant NGF [34], leading to soluble periplasmic expression of DsbA-NGF in E. coli, but yields using this approach are less than expression in cytoplasm [35].",

            "text": "E. coli has been efficiently used for the high-yield production of many recombinant proteins. However, high-level expression often leads to insoluble protein aggregates such as inclusion bodies, and  thus requires additional steps including solubilization and refolding prior to purification. Although the formation of inclusion bodies has certain advantages such as convenient isolation and protection from proteolysis, the recovery of biological activity has often been unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the resolubilization of protein aggregates can be problematic, requires the use of high concentrations of denaturants, and the subsequent refolding process generally requires extensive optimization. \n\nIn this study, we demonstrated the efficient preparation of soluble hGH directly from the E. coli cytoplasmic space under optimized conditions where protein aggregation was minimized. Although we found that a lowering of the induction temperature significantly decreased the formation of inclusion bodies, considerable amounts of recombinant hGH were still found in the insoluble pellet fraction. Unlike inclusion bodies produced by induction at high temperature, we were able to solubilize most of the pelleted hGH under our optimized protein extraction conditions. This observation suggests that they are reversible protein aggregates or clusters, rather than inclusion bodies, probably resulting from non-covalent protein interactions. Numerous detergents are known to disrupt such protein interactions. While anionic and cationic detergents are likely to disrupt protein structure, non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 generally do not disrupt protein structure. We showed that the proper use of non-ionic detergents significantly increased the solubility of hGH during protein extraction. The solubilizing effects of such detergents can be attributed to an association with hydrophobic parts of hGH, disrupting non-specific intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Since detergent-dependent protein solubility varies with the nature of the protein and experimental conditions, an appropriate detergent should be determined empirically. \n\nWhile salt solutions (e.g., 150 mM NaCl) are commonly used for protein extraction, under our conditions the solubility of hGH was somewhat decreased by the addition of NaCl or KCl.",

            "text": "High metabolic burden is also often associated with the accumulation of intracellular proteins as the chaperones become overloaded and inclusion body formation can be observed (Fahnert et al., 2004;Ram\u00f3n et al., 2014). As misfolded intracellular proteins are also known to suffer from long purification times and occasionally low refolding yields (Jungbauer and Kaar, 2007;Singh et al., 2015;Slouka et al., 2018b), the production of soluble extracellular proteins might be a feasible approach. Protein secretion, commonly performed in eukaryotic cells, might also be a key solution to reducing the metabolic burden; however, recombinant protein secretion is not easy to establish in bacteria (Berlec and Strukelj, 2013;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Still, RPP in the periplasm of E. coli has shown to yield promising results, especially when producing antibody fragments, making use of the oxidizing environment (Spadiut et al., 2014a;Kasli et al., 2019). To enable protein secretion in E. coli, engineering of the Sec-Pathway is commonly performed, leading to unfolded protein secretion (Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005;Burdette et al., 2018). Alternatively, the SRP pathway can be used to secrete unfolded hydrophobic amino acid sequences while the twin-arginine pathway can be used to secrete folded proteins to the outer membrane (Berlec and Strukelj, 2013). As the amount of recombinant protein can be as high as 50% of the complete protein content of the cell, the RPP therefore sometimes might be limited by the secretion system itself (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Even though it is challenging to achieve extracellular RPP in E. coli, the company WACKER engineered a secretion system, called ESETEC, which has been upgraded to ESETEC 2 and is able to achieve high extracellular titers (Richter and Koebsch, 2017).",

            "text": "To proteins such as disintegrins, which are rich in cysteine residues, this may lead to low biological activity, protein instability and insolubility [45]. Furthermore, the oxidizing environment in cytoplasm is unavailable, which may result in the production of misfolded recombinant proteins that form insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates known as \"inclusion bodies\" [69,70]. Although only the recombinant disintegrins DisBa-01 [71] and salmosin [72] were described to form inclusion bodies. \n\nThese insoluble aggregates consist primarily of recombinant proteins devoid of biological activity [73]. To recover these proteins with native conformation, it is necessary to solubilize and refold the proteins from inclusion bodies. Redox reactions can be useful during renaturation when the protein contains disulfide bonds [70]. However, the recovery process requires the use of denaturing agents and laborious steps of refolding. The disadvantage of this process is that it may lead to intermediate aggregates, thus limiting the yield of recombinant protein due to poor recovery [70]. On the other hand, protein expression in the form of inclusion bodies can offer the advantage of an easy isolation of homogeneous recombinant proteins with high levels of expression. Moreover, inclusion bodies confer resistance to proteolytic degradation [73]. Alternative steps to improve recover of proteins in their bioactive form from inclusion bodies can be used. These alternatives include the use of mild solvents instead of denaturing agents in the solubilization step [74,75] and slow dilution as an alternative to dialysis in the refolding step [76]. Different strategies for expression can sometimes overcome these limitations related to disulfide-bond formation or problems with inclusion bodies. Proteins can be expressed by secretion to the periplasmic space of bacteria, where there are cell envelope proteins that favor the formation of disulfide bonds [109,110]. This is a suitable strategy for expression of cysteine-rich proteins.",

            "abstract": "Background A number of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold promise as new drugs owing to their potent bactericidal activity and because they are often refractory to the development of drug resistance. Cryptdins (Crps) are a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the small intestine of mice, comprising six isoforms containing three sets of disulfide bonds. Although Crp4 is actively being investigated, there have been few studies to date on the other Crp isoforms. A prerequisite for detailed characterization of the other Crp isoforms is establishment of efficient sample preparation methods. Results To avoid degradation during recombinant expression of Crps in E. coli , co-expression of Crps with the aggregation-prone protein human \u03b1-lactalbumin (HLA) was used to promote the formation of stable inclusion bodies. Using this method, the production of Crp4 and Crp6 by the BL21 strain was effective, but the expression of other Crp isoforms was not as efficient. The results of a cell-free system study suggested that Crps were degraded, even though a substantial amounts of Crps were synthesized. Therefore, using the Origami\u2122 B strain, we were able to significantly increase the expression efficiency of Crps by promoting the formation of erroneous intermolecular disulfide bonds between HLA and Crps, thereby promoting protein aggregation and inclusion body formation, which prevented degradation. The various Crp isoforms were successfully refolded in vitro and purified using reversed-phase HPLC. In addition, the yield was further improved by deformylation of formyl-Crps. We measured the antibacterial activity of Crps against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Each Crp isoform exhibited a completely different trend in antimicrobial activity, although conformational analysis by circular dichroism did not reveal any significant steric differences. Conclusion In this study, we established a novel and efficient method for the production of the cryptdin family of cysteine-containing antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, we found that there were notable differences in the antibacterial activities of the various Crp family members. The expression system established in this study is expected to provide new insights regarding the mechanisms underlying the different antibacterial activities of the Crp family of peptides.",

So far, protein from inclusion bodies has been recovered from the cell factory through mechanical or chemical disruption methods, requiring additional cost-intensive unit operations. We describe a novel method that is using a bacteriophage-derived lysis protein to directly recover inclusion body protein from Escherichia coli from high cell density fermentation process: The recombinant inclusion body product is expressed by using a mixed feed fed-batch process which allows expression tuning via adjusting the specific uptake rate of the inducing substrate. Then, bacteriophage \u03a6X174-derived lysis protein E is expressed to induce cell lysis. Inclusion bodies in empty cell envelopes are harvested via centrifugation of the fermentation broth. A subsequent solubilization step reveals the recombinant protein. The process was investigated by analyzing the impact of fermentation conditions on protein E-mediated cell lysis as well as cell lysis kinetics. Optimal cell lysis efficiencies of 99% were obtained with inclusion body titers of >2.0\u00a0g/l at specific growth rates higher 0.12\u00a0h\u22121 and inducer uptake rates below 0.125\u00a0g/(g\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0h). Protein E-mediated cell disruption showed a first-order kinetics with a kinetic constant of \u22120.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0h\u22121. This alternative inclusion body protein isolation technique was compared to the one via high-pressure homogenization. SDS gel analysis showed 10% less protein impurities when cells had been disrupted via high-pressure homogenization, than when empty cell envelopes including inclusion bodies were investigated. Within this contribution, an innovative technology, tuning recombinant protein production and substituting cost-intensive mechanical cell disruption, is presented.

Using appropriate host/vector systems (e.g., HB101 harboring pTrcKnPAC2902 or MDDeltaP7 harboring pTrcKnPAC2902) in which the expression of the pac gene was regulated by the strong trc promoter, the overproduction of PAC was often limited by periplasmic processing and inclusion bodies composed of protein aggregates of PAC precursors were formed in the periplasm. The amount of these periplasmic inclusion bodies was significantly reduced and PAC activity was significantly increased upon coexpression of DegP. The specific PAC activity reached an extremely high level of 674 U/L/OD(600) for MDDeltaP7 harboring pTrcKnPAC2902 and pKS12 under optimum culture conditions. However, such improvement in the production of PAC was not observed for the expression systems (e.g., MDDeltaP7 harboring pCLL2902) in which the periplasmic processing was not the step limiting the production of PAC. The results suggest that DegP could in vivo assist the periplasmic processing though the enzyme is shown to be not absolutely required for the formation of active PAC in E. coli. In addition, the steps limiting the production of PAC are identified and the reasons for the formation of PAC inclusion bodies are discussed here.",

This set of techniques was strengthened even further later on with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction and allowed scientists to explore and understand essential life processes in an easy and straightforward way. It also marked the birth of the modern biotech industry. At that time, it was shown that eukaryotic DNA could be propagated in Escherichia coli (Morrow et al., 1974) and functional products could be synthesized from heterologous genes cloned in bacterial plasmids (Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977; Vapnek et al., 1977). After these successful cases, it was soon realized that the potential applications of these techniques were almost limitless. In fact, US patent 4,237,224 granted to Cohen and Boyer (1980) claimed to commercial ownership of the methodology for cloning virtually all possible DNAs in all possible vectors. While cloning any gene in any given vector is feasible, obtaining a functional product from its expression is not that simple. \n \nIn this series of articles, the authors describe the methods and technologies available for producing recombinant proteins in different microbes. They also introduce and discuss recent advances that attempt to tackle common pitfalls in the process. Taken together, this E-book will be of great importance for those entering the field as well as for experienced researchers that are looking for an update in the state of the art. \n \nBefore proceeding any further, it is necessary to clarify an important aspect of this topic. In biology, the universal accepted definition of \u201cexpression\u201d is \u201cproduction of an observable phenotype by a gene\u2014usually by directing the synthesis of a protein\u201d (Alberts et al., 2002). By this definition, the term \u201cgene expression\u201d is correct while \u201cprotein expression\u201d is basically lab jargon. We do think that correct usage of scientific language is of great importance, yet in this particular case, the usage of \u201cprotein expression\u201d in the scientific community is so pervasive that readers will immediately understand what we are talking about. So, considering that \u201cprotein expression\u201d found its way into journal names, book names and high-impact reviews (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005) and research papers (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) (>1800 citations in Scopus) we and other authors have used it interchangeably with more correct terms like protein production or protein synthesis.",
                    "[6392822 | Marco et al. | 2007 | Citations: 288]": "BackgroundThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc.",

Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc."

Fusion of ubiquitin to yeast metallothionein or to the alpha subunit of the adenylate cyclase-stimulatory GTP-binding protein increased the yield from undetectable to 20% of the total cellular protein. A ubiquitin-N alpha-protein hydrolase has been partially purified from rabbit reticulocytes; this enzyme faithfully cleaves the junction peptide bound between the C-terminal Gly-76 of ubiquitin and the fusion protein.

There is an expanding choice of tightly regulated prokaryotic promoters suitable for achieving high-level gene expression. New host strains facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and offer higher protein yields by minimizing proteolytic degradation. Insights into the process of protein translocation across the bacterial membranes may eventually make it possible to achieve robust secretion of specific proteins into the culture medium. Studies involving molecular chaperones have shown that in specific cases, chaperones can be very effective for improved protein folding, solubility, and membrane transport. Negative results derived from such studies are also instructive in formulating different strategies. The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that \"rare\" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes. Finally, the elucidation of specific determinants of protein degradation, a plethora of protease-deficient host strains, and methods to stabilize proteins afford new strategies to minimize proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins in E. coli.",

At 37 degrees C, the fusion protein was produced at high levels from the tac promoter, but aggregated quantitatively in a biologically inactive form. In contrast, little preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase was synthesized from the cspA promoter at this temperature, presumably due to transcript instability. The highest yields of active enzyme were obtained following temperature downshift from 37 to 30 degrees C for the tac promoter and 25 degrees C for the cspA promoter. At 25 degrees C, the kinetics of accumulation of beta-galactosidase activity, ratios of soluble to insoluble fusion protein, and synthesis rates of preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase were virtually identical for both promoters for a period of 2 h postinduction. Thereafter, the cspA promoter became repressed, whereas synthesis of the fusion protein continued with the tac system. Following transfer to 10 degrees C, the tac promoter was almost completely inhibited while the cspA promoter was able to direct the synthesis of soluble preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase for up to 2 h. However, the levels of active enzyme produced were approximately threefold lower than those measured at 25 degrees C. Overexpression of native CspA had no effect on the accumulation of active preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase from the cspA promoter. It is therefore unlikely that CspA acts as it own positive inducer. Our results indicate that the cspA promoter can efficiently substitute for the tac system at 25 degrees C and may be particularly valuable for the expression of highly aggregation-prone or unstable gene products at 10 degrees C."

The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium (Strandberg et al., 1991). The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing (Baneyx, 1999)(Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010)(Choi et al., 2004)(Wong, 1999)(Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005)(Missiakas et al., 1997), although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm (Bowden et al., 1991)(Hunke et al., 2003). The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins (Berndt et al., 2008)(Chen et al., 1999)(Merdanovic et al., 2011)(Shao et al., 2000).

Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

Examination of the synthesis and the accumulation of the phoA gene products revealed that a part of them, synthesized in the wild-type strain, undergoes relatively rapid proteolysis and that degP is necessary for such a process.

Simultaneous presence of DsbC and PDI in the refolding buffer shows an additive effect on the reactivation of GAPDH. The assisted reactivation of GAPDH and the protein disulfide oxidoreductase activity of DsbC can both be inhibited by scrambled andS-carboxymethylated RNases, but not by shorter peptides, including synthetic 10- and 14-mer peptides andS-carboxymethylated insulin A chain. In contrast, all the three peptides and the two nonnative RNases inhibit PDI-assisted GAPDH reactivation and the reductase activity of PDI.

The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium (Strandberg et al., 1991). The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing (Baneyx, 1999)(Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010)(Choi et al., 2004)(Wong, 1999)(Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005)(Missiakas et al., 1997), although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm (Bowden et al., 1991)(Hunke et al., 2003). The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins (Berndt et al., 2008)(Chen et al., 1999)(Merdanovic et al., 2011)(Shao et al., 2000). Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins (Ari\u00e9 et al., 2001)(Kadokura et al., 2001)(Zhang et al., 2003). Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22]."

Protein folding is initiated by collapse of the polypeptide chain, which is driven by the TMdesire\u222b of hydrophobic amino acids to escape the polar solvent water. The number of theoretical possible but wrong conformations of a protein is incredibly high: even a small protein consisting of 100 amino acids can adopt 10 different structures.

Reasons for this have been attributed to co-amplification of non-target DNA and the formation of primer concatamers during degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP)-PCR. Here we describe a technique of circumventing this problem by sequence enrichment. It involves co-hybridization of DOP-PCR biotinylated microdissected material and linkered genomic DNA.

Establishing the best fusion partner for difficult\u2010to\u2010express proteins remains empirical. To determine which fusion tags are best suited for difficult\u2010to\u2010express proteins, a comparative analysis of the newly described SUMO fusion system with a variety of commonly used fusion systems was completed. For this study, three model proteins, enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP), matrix metalloprotease\u201013 (MMP13), and myostatin (growth differentiating factor\u20108, GDF8), were fused to the C termini of maltose\u2010binding protein (MBP), glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST), thioredoxin (TRX), NUS A, ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO tags. These constructswere expressed in E. coli and evaluated for expression and solubility. As expected, the fusion tags varied in their ability to produce tractable quantities of soluble eGFP, MMP13, and GDF8. SUMO and NUS A fusions enhanced expression and solubility of recombinant proteins most dramatically. The ease at which SUMO and NUS A fusion tags were removed from their partner proteins was then determined. SUMO fusions are cleaved by the natural SUMO protease, while an AcTEV protease site had to be engineered between NUS A and its partner protein. A kinetic analysis showed that the SUMO and AcTEV proteases had similarKM values, but SUMOprotease had a 25\u2010fold higher kcat than AcTEV protease, indicating a more catalytically efficient enzyme. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SUMO is superior to commonly used fusion tags in enhancing expression and solubility with the distinction of generating recombinant protein with native sequences.",

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies (Arya et al., 2015)(Marco, 2007)(Cui et al., 2011)(Levy et al., 2001). The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding (Folwarczna et al., 2012). Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins (Guzzo, 2012). It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32]...Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins.",

Recently, we showed that in Escherichia coli trxB gor mutants, in which the reduction of thioredoxin and glutathione is impaired, the redox potential of the cytoplasm becomes comparable to that of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, thus allowing the formation of disulfide bonds in certain complex proteins (P. H. Bessette et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 13703-13708]. Here, we investigate the expression of a Fab antibody fragment in the bacterial cytoplasm. The effect of coexpressing cytoplasmic chaperones (GroEL/ES, trigger factor, DnaK/J), as well as signal sequenceless versions of periplasmic chaperones (DsbC and Skp), was examined. Skp coexpression was shown to have the most significant effect (five- to sixfold increase) on the yield of correctly folded Fab. A maximum yield of 0.8 mg Fab/L/OD(600) Fab was obtained, indicating that cytoplasmic expression may be a viable alternative for the preparative production of antibody fragments."

Inclusion-body-prone proteins have often been reported to escape precipitation when fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP). Here, we have examined the case of HPV 16 oncoprotein E6. The unfused sequence of E6 is overexpressed as inclusion bodies in bacteria. By contrast, fusions of E6 to the C-terminus of MBP are produced soluble. We have analyzed preparations of soluble MBP-E6 fusions by using three independent approaches: dynamic light scattering, lateral turbidimetry, and sandwich ELISA. All three methods showed that MBP-E6 preparations contain highly aggregated material. The behavior of these soluble aggregates under denaturating conditions suggests that they are formed by agglomeration of misfolded E6 moieties. However, precipitation is prevented by the presence of the folded and highly soluble MBP moieties, which maintain the aggregates in solution. Therefore, the fact that a protein or protein domain is produced soluble when fused to the C-terminus of a carrier protein does not guarantee that the protein of interest is properly folded and active. We suggest that aggregation of fusion proteins should be systematically assayed, especially when these fusions are to be used for binding measurements or activity tests."

However, recent advancement of biotechnology has shown substantial recovery of bioactive protein from such insoluble IBs by solubilization and refolding processes. In addition, gene fusion technology has also widely been used to improve the soluble protein production using E. coli. This study demonstrates that mild-solubilization and in vitro refolding strategies, both are capable to recover soluble scFv protein from bacterial IBs, although the degree of success is greatly influenced by different fusion tags with the target protein.ResultsIt was observed that the most commonly used fusion tag, i.e., maltose binding protein (MBP) was not only influenced the cytoplasmic expression in E. coli but also greatly improved the in vitro refolding yield of scFv protein. On the other hand, mild solubilization process potentially could recover soluble and functional scFv protein from non-classical IBs without assistance of any fusion tag and in vitro refolding step. The recovery yield achieved by mild solubilization process was also found higher than denaturation\u2013refolding method except while scFv was refolded in fusion with MBP tag. Concomitantly, it was also observed that the soluble protein achieved by mild solubilization\nprocess was better structured and functionally more active than the one achieved by in vitro refolding method in the absence of MBP tag or refolding enhancer.ConclusionsMaltose binding protein tagged scFv has shown better refolding and solubility yields as compare to mild solubilization process. However, in terms of cost, time and tag free nature, mild solubilization method for scFv recovery from bacterial IBs is considerable for therapeutic application and further structural studies."

However, heterologous expression of hSOD1 has remained an issue due to Cu2+ insufficiency at protein active site, leading to low solubility and enzymatic activity. Objectives The effect of co-expressed human copper chaperone (hCCS) to enhance the solubility and enzymatic activity of hSOD1 in E. coli was investigated in the presence and absence of Cu2+. Materials and Methods pETDuet-1-hSOD1 and pETDuet-1-hCCS-hSOD1 were constructed and individually transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The recombinant hSOD1 was expressed and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The yield and specific activity of hSOD1 in all conditions were studied. Results Co-expression with hCCS increased hSOD1 solubility at 37\u00b0C, but this effect was not observed at 25\u00b0C. Notably, the specific activity of hSOD1 was enhanced by 1.5 fold and greater than 3 fold when co-expressed with hCCS at 25\u00b0C with and without Cu2+ supplement, respectively. However, the chaperone co-expression did not significantly increase the yield of hSOD1 comparable to the expression of hSOD1 alone. Conclusions This study is the first report demonstrating a potential use of hCCS for heterologous production of hSOD1 with high enzymatic activity."

Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Pacheco et al., 2012). However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020). Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein (Sijwali et al., 2001).

The soluble GM-CSF was subjected to endotoxin removal and purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography, ultrafiltration. The biological activity of produced GM-CSF was evaluated based on its growth promotion effect on TF-1 cell lines by MTT assay method. Findings / Results: A significant improvement of the soluble yield of GM-CSF (about 30% of GM-CSF was expressed as soluble proteins) was observed when protein expression was induced at 30 \u00b0C with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in E. coli Shuffle T7.

High-yield expression was achieved using M15(pREP4) Escherichia coli transformed with the pQE-30 plasmid containing a truncated profalcipain-2 construct. Recombinant falcipain-2 was expressed as inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A systematic approach was then used to optimize refolding parameters. This approach utilized 100-fold dilutions of reduced and denatured falcipain-2 into 203 different buffers in a microtiter plate format. Refolding efficiency varied markedly. Optimal refolding was obtained in an alkaline buffer containing glycerol or sucrose and equal concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione. After optimization of the expression and refolding protocols and additional purification with anion-exchange chromatography, 12 mg of falcipain-2 was obtained from 5 liters of E. coli, and crystals of the protease were grown.

The aim of this research was to improve solubilizing and refolding conditions for IBs of scFv version of pertuzumab (anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody). After protein overexpression in E. coli BL21 (DE3), bacterial cells were lysed and IBs were extracted via repeated washing and centrifugation. The effect of different types, concentrations, pHs, and additive of denaturing agents on IBs solubility were evaluated. More than 40 refolding additives were screened and combinations of 10 of the best additives were check out using Plackett-Burman design to choose three refolding additives with the most positive effect on refolding of the scFv. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the concentration of adopted additives. The most efficient buffer to solubilize IBs was a buffer containing 6 M urea with 6 mM beta mercaptoethanol, pH 11. The optimum concentration of three buffer additives for refolding of the scFv was 23 mM tricine, 0.55 mM arginine, and 14.3 mM imidazole. The bioactivity of the refolded scFv was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer tissue, a specific binding based method. The systematic optimization of refolding buffer developed in the present work will contribute to improve the refolding of other scFv fragments."

A variety of methods have been reported to tackle these issues, for instance, optimizing culture and purification conditions (Kiedzierska et al., 2008), recovering and re-folding active proteins from inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015), expression in the periplasm, and many others (Ban et al., 2020). In addition to this array of strategies, in this study we have coupled two, somewhat disjoint methodologies, but when combined lead to significantly increased yields of soluble protein. \n\nFirst, we sought to reduce inclusion body formation with an autoinduction method mediated by rewiring the genetic circuitry of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) so that instead of mediating endogenous QS functions like biofilm formation, we engineered cells to induce expression of genes-of-interest. Overexpression of a recombinant protein is often accompanied by an imbalance of metabolism, often referred to as a \"metabolic burden\" (Bentley et al., 1990). In addition, the induction process is typically initiated by the addition of a bolus of inducer, which, in turn, can bring about significant transients in precursors or energy levels (Harcum et al., 1993)(Ramirez et al., 1995)(DeLisa et al., 2001). This imposed stress could exhaust the bacterium's innate protein folding and quality control machinery, leading to improperly folded proteins that aggregate and form inclusion bodies or get targeted for degradation.",

Mild solubilization methods have been discussed which are based on the understanding of the fact that protein molecules in inclusion body aggregates have native-like structure. These methods solubilize the inclusion body aggregates while preserving the native-like protein structure. Subsequent protein refolding and purification results in high recovery of bioactive protein.

Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies.

However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity."

A variety of methods have been reported to tackle these issues, for instance, optimizing culture and purification conditions (Kiedzierska et al., 2008), recovering and re-folding active proteins from inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015), expression in the periplasm, and many others (Ban et al., 2020). In addition to this array of strategies, in this study we have coupled two, somewhat disjoint methodologies, but when combined lead to significantly increased yields of soluble protein. \n\nFirst, we sought to reduce inclusion body formation with an autoinduction method mediated by rewiring the genetic circuitry of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) so that instead of mediating endogenous QS functions like biofilm formation, we engineered cells to induce expression of genes-of-interest. Overexpression of a recombinant protein is often accompanied by an imbalance of metabolism, often referred to as a \"metabolic burden\" (Bentley et al., 1990). In addition, the induction process is typically initiated by the addition of a bolus of inducer, which, in turn, can bring about significant transients in precursors or energy levels (Harcum et al., 1993)(Ramirez et al., 1995)(DeLisa et al., 2001). This imposed stress could exhaust the bacterium's innate protein folding and quality control machinery, leading to improperly folded proteins that aggregate and form inclusion bodies or get targeted for degradation."

Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. As inclusion bodies contain relatively pure and intact proteins, protein refolding is an important process to obtain active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, conventional refolding methods, such as dialysis and dilution, are time consuming and, often, recovered yields of active proteins are low, and a trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. Recently, several approaches have been reported to refold these aggregated proteins into an active form. The strategies largely aim at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This review focuses on protein refolding techniques using chemical additives and laminar flow in microfluidic chips for the efficient recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies.",

These selected additives are natural ligands, detergents, salts, buffers, and chemicals that have been shown to increase the stability of proteins in vivo. We present the methods used for this additive solubility screen and detailed results for 41 potential drug target recombinant proteins from infectious organisms. Increased solubility was observed for 80% of the recombinant proteins during the primary and secondary screening of lysis with the additives; that is 33 of 41 target proteins had increased solubility compared with no additive controls. Eleven additives (trehalose, glycine betaine, mannitol, L-Arginine, potassium citrate, CuCl2, proline, xylitol, NDSB 201, CTAB and K2PO4) solubilized more than one of the 41 proteins; these additives can be easily screened to increase protein solubility. Large-scale purifications were attempted for 15 of the proteins using the additives identified and eight (40%) were prepared for crystallization trials during the first purification attempt. Thus, this protocol allowed us to recover about a third of seemingly insoluble proteins for crystallography and structure determination. If recombinant proteins are required in smaller quantities or less purity, the final success rate may be even higher."

Expressing recombinant human ALDH3A1 has been difficult in Escherichia coli (E. coli) because of low solubility, yield and insufficient purity issues. In this report, we compared different E. coli expression strategies (namely the maltose binding protein; MBP- and the 6-his-tagged expression systems) under conditions of auto-induction and co-expression with E. coli\u2019s molecular chaperones where appropriate. Thus, we aimed to screen the efficiency of these expression strategies in order to improve solubility of recombinant ALDH3A1 when expressed in E. coli. We showed that the MBP- tagged expression in combination with lower-temperature culture conditions resulted in active soluble recombinant ALDH3A1. Expression of the fused 6-his tagged-ALDH3A1 protein resulted in poor solubility and neither lowering temperature culture conditions nor the auto-induction strategy improved its solubility. Furthermore, higher yield of soluble, active native form of 6-his tagged-ALDH3A1 was facilitated through co-expression of the two groups of E. coli\u2019s molecular chaperones, GroES/GroEL and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. Convenient one step immobilized affinity chromatography methods were utilized to purify the fused ALDH3A1 hybrids. Both fusion proteins retained their biological activity and could be used directly without removing the fusion tags. Taken together, our results provide a rational option for producing sufficient amounts of soluble and active recombinant ALDH3A1 using the E. coli expression system for conducting functional studies towards elucidating the biological role(s) of this interesting corneal crystallin.",

This kind of antigen increases immunogenicity of any conjugated antigen upon administration. Thus, it is supposed to have an enormous potentiality for vaccine development against bacterial infections and cancer diseases. fljB gene (1515 nucleotides) coding for mature FljB was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium and inserted into pET32a(+) for expression in E. coli BL21. The protein FljB was well expressed under the fusion form with Trx, S-tag at N terminal and hexa-histidine at C terminal, thus the recombinant protein was abbreviated to TrxFljB. Study on the impact of temperature on the gene expression showed that TrxFljB was synthesized at lower level at 37 o C comparing to the levels at 22 o C and 25 o C. 13% of the protein synthesized at 37 o C was inclusion body. Lower temperatures used during induction phase increased the solubility of the recombinant protein. About 97% of TrxFljB synthesized at 25 o C was soluble. IPTG concentration had a strong effect on the growth of freshly transformed cells but did not affect on the growth of stored and re-cultivated cells. The increase of IPTG concentration resulted in the decrease of the growth of freshly transformed cells and the TrxFljB productivity. However, 0.05 mM IPTG concentration was found to gain the full TrxFljB expression. TrxFljB productivity declined during storage of cells at 4 o C and re-cultivation. At optimal condition, volumetric productivity of TrxFljB was about 300 mg/ l broth."

Several strategies have been developed to improve the yield and one of the most common strategies is the fusion of the target protein with a suitable partner. Despite several reports on the successful use of each of these carriers to increase the solubility of some recombinant proteins, none of them was always successful and a combinatorial approach seems more efficient to identify the optimal combination for a specific protein. Therefore, the efficiency of an expression system critically depends on the speed in the identification of the optimal combination for the suitable fusion candidate in a screening process. This paper describes a set of expression vectors (pETM) designed for rapid subcloning, expression and subsequent purification using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC).ResultsA single PCR product of two Yellow Fluorescent Proteins (EYFPs) was cloned into 18 vectors comprising identical restriction sites and varying fusion partners as well as differing protease recognition sites. After a small-scale expression, the yields of the different constructs were compared using a Coomassie stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the results of this preliminary screening were then confirmed by large-scale purification. The yields were calculated and the stability of the different constructs determined using three independent conditions. The results indicated a significant correlation between the length and composition of non-native amino acid tails and stability. Furthermore, the buffer specificity of TEV and 3C proteases was tested using fusion proteins differing only in their protease recognition sequence, and a His-GST-EYFP construct was employed to compare the efficiency of the two alternative affinity purification methods.ConclusionThe experiments showed that the set of pETM vectors could be used for the rapid production of a large array of different constructs with specific yield, stability, and cleavage features. Their comparison allowed the identification of the optimal constructs to use for the large-scale expression. We expect that the approach outlined in this paper, i.e. the possibility to obtain in parallel fusion products of the target protein with different partners for a preliminary evaluation, would be highly beneficial for all them who are interested in the rapid identification of the optimal conditions for protein expression.",

Refolding of inclusion body proteins into bioactive forms is cumbersome, results in poor recovery and accounts for the major cost in production of recombinant proteins from E. coli. With new information available on the structure and function of protein aggregates in bacterial inclusion bodies, it has been possible to develop improved solubilization and refolding procedures for higher recovery of bioactive protein. Inclusion bodies are formed from partially folded protein intermediates and are composed of aggregates of mostly single types of polypeptide. This helps to isolate and purify the protein aggregates to homogeneity before solubilization and refolding. Proteins inside inclusion body aggregates have native-like secondary structures. It is assumed that restoration of this native-like secondary structure using mild solubilization conditions will help in improved recovery of bioactive protein in comparison to solubilization using a high concentration of chaotropic agent. Analysis of the dominant forces causing aggregation during inclusion body formation provides information to develop suitable mild solubilization procedures for inclusion body proteins. Refolding from such solubilized protein will be very high due to restoration of native-like secondary structure. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies were purified to homogeneity from E. coli cells before solubilization and refolding. Pure inclusion bodies were solubilized at alkaline pH in the presence of 2 M urea solution. The solubilized proteins were refolded using a pulsatile renaturation process and subsequently purified using chromatographic procedures. More than 40% of the inclusion body proteins could be refolded back to the bioactive native conformation. Mild solubilization is thus the key for high recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies.",

Against the outdated belief that the production of IBs should be avoided during recombinant protein production, quite a number of recombinant products are currently produced as IBs, which are then processed to give correctly folded and soluble product. However, this processing is quite cumbersome comprising IB wash, IB solubilization and refolding. To date, IB processing often happens rather uncontrolled and relies on empiricism rather than sound process understanding. In this mini review we describe current efforts to introduce more monitoring and control in IB processes, focusing on the refolding step, and thus generate process understanding and knowledge."

                "snippets": "A problem with folding errors that is routinely described in the literature is the inclusion bodies occurrence due to misfolded recombinant proteins. Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143]. The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144]. As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies. Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains. For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145]. The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources. This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids. The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148]. Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149]. These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31]40].",

However, the production of a foreign protein in recombinant E. coli often leads to growth deterioration and elevated secretion of acetic acid. Such observed phenomena have been widely linked with cell stress responses and metabolic burdens originated particularly from the increased energy demand. In this study, flux balance analysis and dynamic flux balance analysis were applied to investigate the observed growth physiology of recombinant E. coli, incorporating the proteome allocation theory and an adjustable maintenance energy level (ATPM) to capture the proteomic and energetic burdens introduced by recombinant protein synthesis. Model predictions of biomass growth, substrate consumption, acetate excretion, and protein production with two different strains were in good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that the constraint on the available proteomic resource and the change in ATPM might be important contributors governing the growth physiology of recombinant strains. The modeling framework developed in this work, currently with several limitations to overcome, offers a starting point for the development of a practical, model\u2010based tool to guide metabolic engineering decisions for boosting recombinant protein production."

                        "quote": "A problem with folding errors that is routinely described in the literature is the inclusion bodies occurrence due to misfolded recombinant proteins. Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143]. The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144]. As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies. Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains. For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145]. The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources. This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids. The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148]. Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149]. These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31]40]."

However, most of the rhGALNS produced was present as protein aggregates. Here, several methods were investigated to improve production and activity of rhGALNS. These methods involved the use of physiologically-regulated promoters and alternatives to improve protein folding including global stress responses (osmotic shock), overexpression of native chaperones, and enhancement of cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation. Increase of rhGALNS activity was obtained when a promoter regulated under \u03c3s was implemented. Additionally, improvements were observed when osmotic shock was applied. Noteworthy, overexpression of chaperones did not have any effect on rhGALNS activity, suggesting that the effect of osmotic shock was probably due to a general stress response and not to the action of an individual chaperone. Finally, it was observed that high concentrations of sucrose in conjunction with the physiological-regulated promoter proUmod significantly increased the rhGALNS production and activity. Together, these results describe advances in the current knowledge on the production of human recombinant enzymes in a prokaryotic system such as E. coli, and could have a significant impact on the development of enzyme replacement therapies for lysosomal storage diseases.",

In this study, the effect of the signal peptide (SP), inducer concentration, process scale, and operational mode (batch and semi-continuous) on GALNS production were evaluated. When native SP was presented, higher enzyme activity levels were observed in both soluble and inclusion bodies fractions, and its removal had a significant impact on enzyme activation. At shake scale, the optimal IPTG concentrations were 0.5 and 1.5 mM for the strains with and without SP, respectively, whereas at bench scale, the highest enzyme activities were observed with 1.5 mM IPTG for both strains. Noteworthy, enzyme activity in the culture media was only detected when SP was presented and the culture was carried out under semi-continuous mode. We showed for the first time that the mechanism that in prokaryotes recognizes the SP to mediate sulfatase activation can also recognize a eukaryotic SP, favoring the activation of the enzyme, and could also favor the secretion of the recombinant protein. These results offer significant information for scaling-up the production of human sulfatases in E. coli."

The effects of overproduction of molecular chaperones on the intracellular solubility of newly produced recombinant TGase were examined. The overexpression of dnaK or groES/EL did not improve solubility. However, DnaJ greatly increased the solubility of the recombinant TGase, resulting in active enzyme in the presence of calcium ions. Co-expression of dnaK along with dnaJ further increased the content of soluble TGase. Under our experimental conditions, supplementation with both DnaJ and DnaK elevated the TGase activity in the producer cells by roughly 4-fold, compared with the control strain cultured at 30 degrees C.

In the present study, we focused on CyDs (cyclodextrins), cyclic oligosaccharides composed of glucose units, and reported the inhibitory effect of CyDs on TTR amyloid formation. Of various branched \u03b2-CyDs, GUG-\u03b2-CyD [6-O-\u03b1-(4-O-\u03b1-D-glucuronyl)-D-glucosyl-\u03b2-CyD] showed potent inhibition of TTR amyloid formation. Far-UV CD spectra analysis showed that GUG-\u03b2-CyD reduced the conformational change of TTR in the process of amyloid formation. In addition, tryptophan fluorescence and 1H-NMR spectroscopy analyses indicated that GUG-\u03b2-CyD stabilized the TTR conformation via interaction with the hydrophobic amino acids of TTR, especially tryptophan. Moreover, GUG-\u03b2-CyD exerted its inhibitory effect by reducing TTR deposition in transgenic rats possessing a human variant TTR gene in vivo.

In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins (Francis et al., 2010). Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies...Although the formation of inclusion bodies may be further reduced by optimizing environmental factors such as culture media (Baneyx et al., 2004) or genetic engineering (Makrides, 1996)(S\u00f8rensen et al., 2005), we reasoned that the observed protein aggregation may involve some other factors such as non-specific protein interactions. To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented (Bondos et al., 2003). We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure.

In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity.

There is an expanding choice of tightly regulated prokaryotic promoters suitable for achieving high-level gene expression. New host strains facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and offer higher protein yields by minimizing proteolytic degradation. Insights into the process of protein translocation across the bacterial membranes may eventually make it possible to achieve robust secretion of specific proteins into the culture medium. Studies involving molecular chaperones have shown that in specific cases, chaperones can be very effective for improved protein folding, solubility, and membrane transport. Negative results derived from such studies are also instructive in formulating different strategies. The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that \"rare\" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes.

As molecular chaperones are involved in the protein-folding process, their over-expression was usually carried out in order to increase the stability and solubility of the produced target recombinant protein (Marco et al., 2007)Tegel et al., 2011;(Makhoba et al., 2015)(Gounel et al., 2016).

Here we investigated the functional relationship of TF and DnaK by comparing various functional properties of both chaperones. First, we analyzed the ability of TF and DnaK to associate with nascent polypeptides and fulllength proteins released from the ribosome. Toward this end, we established an E. coli based transcription/translation system containing physiological ratios of TF, DnaK and ribosomes. In this system, TF can be crosslinked to nascent polypeptides of \u03c332. No TF crosslink was found to fulllength \u03c332, which is known to be a DnaK substrate. In contrast, DnaK crosslinked to both nascent and fulllength \u03c332. DnaK crosslinks critically depended on the type of chemical crosslinker. Crosslinks represent specific substratechaperone interactions since they relied on the association of the nascent polypeptides with the substrate binding pocket of DnaK. While DnaK is known to be the major chaperone to prevent protein aggregation under heat shock conditions, we found that TF did not prevent aggregation of thermally unfolded proteins in vitro and was not able to complement the heatsensitive phenotype of a \u03b4naK52 mutant in vivo. These data indicate that TF and DnaK show strong differences in their ability to prevent aggregation of denatured proteins and to associate with native like substrates, but share the ability to associate with nascent polypeptides.",

The production of recombinant proteins in foreign host system such as E. coli has been a biggest challenge. This has brought negative impact on the ongoing search for alternative drugs and vaccines for diseases such as schistosomiasis, African sleeping sickness and malaria. At present, no system is available to produce various recombinant proteins from different sources. Hence, the search for a universal system that can be utilized for any recombinant protein is crucial. The basic requirements for high quality protein production in a pure active and soluble form have led to the use of molecular chaperones as supplement during recombinant proteins production in E. coli. Molecular chaperones are proteins that are known to assist the newly synthesized proteins to complete their folding stages. This system has improved various proteins that are difficult to produce in E. coli host. However, some proteins have not been produced as pure, soluble or active proteins. For this reason this has led to some researchers to suggest the use of engineered host systems that do not produce endogenous molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 or Hsp40. However, these systems are not easy to work with because of their fragileness. Therefore, this work explores some progresses made as well as challenges faced in coming up with the desired system that can meet all the requirements to obtain the desired protein product.",

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

As molecular chaperones are involved in the protein-folding process, their over-expression was usually carried out in order to increase the stability and solubility of the produced target recombinant protein (Marco et al., 2007)Tegel et al., 2011;(Makhoba et al., 2015)(Gounel et al., 2016).

                            "Among the available expression hosts, E. coli remains the most attractive one for production of heterologous proteins for a variety of downstream utilization. Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Pacheco et al., 2012). However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020). Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein (Sijwali et al., 2001). So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins (Salehinia et al., 2018). Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host. Varying several parameters such as fusion partners, post induction temperature, promoters, or E. coli strains have been reported to be able to alleviate the insolubility problem and increase the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [15]."

                            "A problem with folding errors that is routinely described in the literature is the inclusion bodies occurrence due to misfolded recombinant proteins. Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143]. The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144]. As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies. Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains. For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145]. The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources. This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids. The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148]. Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149]. These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31]40]."

                            "Escherichia coli has been the host organism most frequently investigated for efficient recombinant protein production. However, the production of a foreign protein in recombinant E. coli often leads to growth deterioration and elevated secretion of acetic acid. Such observed phenomena have been widely linked with cell stress responses and metabolic burdens originated particularly from the increased energy demand. In this study, flux balance analysis and dynamic flux balance analysis were applied to investigate the observed growth physiology of recombinant E. coli, incorporating the proteome allocation theory and an adjustable maintenance energy level (ATPM) to capture the proteomic and energetic burdens introduced by recombinant protein synthesis. Model predictions of biomass growth, substrate consumption, acetate excretion, and protein production with two different strains were in good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that the constraint on the available proteomic resource and the change in ATPM might be important contributors governing the growth physiology of recombinant strains. The modeling framework developed in this work, currently with several limitations to overcome, offers a starting point for the development of a practical, model\u2010based tool to guide metabolic engineering decisions for boosting recombinant protein production."

                            "AbstractBackgroundThe production of therapeutically active single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody is still challenging in E. coli due to the aggregation propensity of recombinant protein into inclusion bodies (IBs). However, recent advancement of biotechnology has shown substantial recovery of bioactive protein from such insoluble IBs by solubilization and refolding processes. In addition, gene fusion technology has also widely been used to improve the soluble protein production using E. coli. This study demonstrates that mild-solubilization and in vitro refolding strategies, both are capable to recover soluble scFv protein from bacterial IBs, although the degree of success is greatly influenced by different fusion tags with the target protein.ResultsIt was observed that the most commonly used fusion tag, i.e., maltose binding protein (MBP) was not only influenced the cytoplasmic expression in E. coli but also greatly improved the in vitro refolding yield of scFv protein. On the other hand, mild solubilization process potentially could recover soluble and functional scFv protein from non-classical IBs without assistance of any fusion tag and in vitro refolding step. The recovery yield achieved by mild solubilization process was also found higher than denaturation\u2013refolding method except while scFv was refolded in fusion with MBP tag. Concomitantly, it was also observed that the soluble protein achieved by mild solubilization\nprocess was better structured and functionally more active than the one achieved by in vitro refolding method in the absence of MBP tag or refolding enhancer.ConclusionsMaltose binding protein tagged scFv has shown better refolding and solubility yields as compare to mild solubilization process. However, in terms of cost, time and tag free nature, mild solubilization method for scFv recovery from bacterial IBs is considerable for therapeutic application and further structural studies."

In order to obtain large quantities of active falcipain-2 for biochemical and structural analysis, a systematic assessment of optimal parameters for the expression and refolding of the protease was carried out. High-yield expression was achieved using M15(pREP4) Escherichia coli transformed with the pQE-30 plasmid containing a truncated profalcipain-2 construct. Recombinant falcipain-2 was expressed as inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A systematic approach was then used to optimize refolding parameters. This approach utilized 100-fold dilutions of reduced and denatured falcipain-2 into 203 different buffers in a microtiter plate format. Refolding efficiency varied markedly. Optimal refolding was obtained in an alkaline buffer containing glycerol or sucrose and equal concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione. After optimization of the expression and refolding protocols and additional purification with anion-exchange chromatography, 12 mg of falcipain-2 was obtained from 5 liters of E. coli, and crystals of the protease were grown. The systematic approach described here allowed the rapid evaluation of a large number of expression and refolding conditions and provided milligram quantities of recombinant falcipain-2."

                            "The emergence of recombinant DNA technology during the early 70's set a revolution in molecular biology. This set of techniques was strengthened even further later on with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction and allowed scientists to explore and understand essential life processes in an easy and straightforward way. It also marked the birth of the modern biotech industry. At that time, it was shown that eukaryotic DNA could be propagated in Escherichia coli (Morrow et al., 1974) and functional products could be synthesized from heterologous genes cloned in bacterial plasmids (Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977; Vapnek et al., 1977). After these successful cases, it was soon realized that the potential applications of these techniques were almost limitless. In fact, US patent 4,237,224 granted to Cohen and Boyer (1980) claimed to commercial ownership of the methodology for cloning virtually all possible DNAs in all possible vectors. While cloning any gene in any given vector is feasible, obtaining a functional product from its expression is not that simple. \n \nIn this series of articles, the authors describe the methods and technologies available for producing recombinant proteins in different microbes. They also introduce and discuss recent advances that attempt to tackle common pitfalls in the process. Taken together, this E-book will be of great importance for those entering the field as well as for experienced researchers that are looking for an update in the state of the art. \n \nBefore proceeding any further, it is necessary to clarify an important aspect of this topic. In biology, the universal accepted definition of \"expression\" is \"production of an observable phenotype by a gene\u2014usually by directing the synthesis of a protein\" (Alberts et al., 2002). By this definition, the term \"gene expression\" is correct while \"protein expression\" is basically lab jargon. We do think that correct usage of scientific language is of great importance, yet in this particular case, the usage of \"protein expression\" in the scientific community is so pervasive that readers will immediately understand what we are talking about. So, considering that \"protein expression\" found its way into journal names, book names and high-impact reviews (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005) and research papers (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) (>1800 citations in Scopus) we and other authors have used it interchangeably with more correct terms like protein production or protein synthesis."

                            "BackgroundThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

This approach is one of the most effective and widely used strategies to prevent inclusion body formation despite potentially lower overall protein yields. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nReducing cultivation temperature is a well-established and highly effective strategy for minimizing inclusion body formation during recombinant protein expression in E. coli. While standard expression protocols typically operate at 37\u00b0C, lowering the temperature to 16-25\u00b0C can dramatically increase the yield of soluble, correctly folded proteins <Paper corpusId=\"112829\" paperTitle=\"(Schumann et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"13571021\" paperTitle=\"(Spadiut et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255290846\" paperTitle=\"(Bartolo-Aguilar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\nThe effectiveness of lower temperatures in promoting soluble protein production stems from multiple mechanisms. First, reduced temperatures slow the rate of protein synthesis, allowing nascent polypeptides more time to fold correctly before aggregation can occur <Paper corpusId=\"112829\" paperTitle=\"(Schumann et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Second, lower temperatures decrease the hydrophobic interactions that drive protein self-association and aggregation <Paper corpusId=\"7564064\" paperTitle=\"(Costa et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Third, expression and activity of several E. coli chaperones actually increases at lower temperatures (around 30\u00b0C), enhancing protein folding efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"21204854\" paperTitle=\"(Spencer et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15164270\" paperTitle=\"(Mogk et al., 2002)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe optimal temperature for soluble protein expression is protein-dependent but frequently falls between 16-25\u00b0C. For example, Kim and colleagues observed that induction at temperatures between 16-20\u00b0C significantly increased the amount of soluble human growth hormone without modifying their protein extraction method <Paper corpusId=\"650400\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31546198\" paperTitle=\"(Francis et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Motevalli et al. achieved soluble protein expression using growth at 16\u00b0C for 20 hours, whereas the same protein formed inclusion bodies at 37\u00b0C after just 3 hours of induction <Paper corpusId=\"73500125\" paperTitle=\"(Motevalli et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLower temperature expression can also provide additional benefits, including reduced proteolytic degradation of target proteins <Paper corpusId=\"233674494\" paperTitle=\"(Iftikhar, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> and improved export and folding of functional recombinant proteins <Paper corpusId=\"233674494\" paperTitle=\"(Iftikhar, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For particularly aggregation-prone proteins, specialized cold-inducible expression systems have been developed that combine the benefits of low-temperature expression with higher productivity <Paper corpusId=\"255290846\" paperTitle=\"(Bartolo-Aguilar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1585460\" paperTitle=\"(Rosano et al._1, 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. The cspA promoter system, for example, can direct the expression of soluble, aggregation-prone proteins at temperatures as low as 10\u00b0C <Paper corpusId=\"13571021\" paperTitle=\"(Spadiut et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"45491398\" paperTitle=\"(Vasina et al., 1997)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe primary drawback of low-temperature expression is the inevitable reduction in bacterial growth rate and, consequently, potentially lower overall protein yields <Paper corpusId=\"255290846\" paperTitle=\"(Bartolo-Aguilar et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, reduced temperatures can affect replication, transcription, and translation rates <Paper corpusId=\"7564064\" paperTitle=\"(Costa et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc."

                            "A major drawback of overexpressing recombinant proteins in E. coli is that they often do not readily fold into their native conformation. Instead, they can quickly form aggregates under conventional expression conditions, that is, when chemically or nutritionally inducible promoters drive the expression at physiological temperatures. Recombinant proteins readily accumulate into so-called inclusion bodies, for this reason, alternative protocols have been developed to recover these proteins. To obtain a given amount of soluble protein, a common approach involves the production of larger amounts of the protein expressed as inclusion bodies. Additional processes to recover the later protein may include in vitro refolding, strain engineering to increase the concentration of molecular chaperones, or cell cultures at relatively low temperatures. Low-temperature protein expression in E. coli prevents the degradation of proteolytically sensitive products and restricts the overall protein synthesis (Rosano et al., 2014)(Falak et al., 2022), this may result in a higher yield of soluble protein versus aggregation-prone proteins or unstable products. However, cell growth may be notably affected under these conditions. Alternatively, bacterial expression systems with vectors directed by cold-inducible promoters may be grown at low temperatures for short periods only. This strategy often leads to overexpression of the target protein with the advantages cited above for cultures performed fully at low temperatures, i.e., with greater productivity of the target protein (Rosano et al., 2014)(Lin et al., 2018)."

                            "Several methods have been shown to prevent or decrease protein aggregation during protein production in E. coli on a trial-and-error basis, including:\n\n(i) Lower expression temperatures: bacteria cultivation at reduced temperatures is often used to reduce protein aggregation, since it slows down the rate of protein synthesis and folding kinetics, decreasing the hydrophobic interactions that are involved in protein self-aggregation (Schumann et al., 2004)Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). Low cultivation temperatures can also reduce or impair protein degradation due to a poor activity of heat shock proteases that are usually induced during protein overproduction in E. coli (Chesshyre et al., 1989). This strategy has, however, some drawbacks as the reduction of temperature can also affect replication, transcription, and translation rates, besides decreasing the bacterial growth and protein production yields. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by the use of coldinducible promoters that maximize protein production under low temperature conditions (Mujacic et al., 1999). (ii) E. coli-engineered host strains: E. coli mutant strains are a significant advance toward the soluble production of difficult recombinant proteins. Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Ma"

This over expression is not always well tolerated by the metabolic system of the host and in some situations a cellular stress response is encountered. One phenomenon to be avoided during over expression is the accumulation of over expressed proteins into insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies. These aggregated proteins are in general misfolded and thus biologically inactive. This can be avoided in part by slowing down expression rate using low temperatures, indeed, the expression and activity of a number of E. coli chaperones is increased at 30 \u2022 C (Ferrer et al., 2003)(Mogk et al., 2002) hence increasing protein folding efficiency and reducing precipitation into inclusion bodies.

In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins (Francis et al., 2010). Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies",

To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented (Bondos et al., 2003). We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure. As shown in Figure 2A, the use of Triton X-100 significantly increased the solubility of hGH expressed at low temperature."

Lowering the culture temperature is also seen to enhance the proper export and folding of functional recombinant proteins (Jeffrey et al., 1990). As seen in the case of lower concentration of IPTG induction, lower temperature helps in the proper formation of recombinant proteins by reducing their overexpression which ultimately leads the protein to the folding pathways and hence protein aggregation does not occur (Knappik et al., 1993)."

At 37 degrees C, the fusion protein was produced at high levels from the tac promoter, but aggregated quantitatively in a biologically inactive form. In contrast, little preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase was synthesized from the cspA promoter at this temperature, presumably due to transcript instability. The highest yields of active enzyme were obtained following temperature downshift from 37 to 30 degrees C for the tac promoter and 25 degrees C for the cspA promoter. At 25 degrees C, the kinetics of accumulation of beta-galactosidase activity, ratios of soluble to insoluble fusion protein, and synthesis rates of preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase were virtually identical for both promoters for a period of 2 h postinduction. Thereafter, the cspA promoter became repressed, whereas synthesis of the fusion protein continued with the tac system. Following transfer to 10 degrees C, the tac promoter was almost completely inhibited while the cspA promoter was able to direct the synthesis of soluble preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase for up to 2 h. However, the levels of active enzyme produced were approximately threefold lower than those measured at 25 degrees C. Overexpression of native CspA had no effect on the accumulation of active preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase from the cspA promoter. It is therefore unlikely that CspA acts as it own positive inducer. Our results indicate that the cspA promoter can efficiently substitute for the tac system at 25 degrees C and may be particularly valuable for the expression of highly aggregation-prone or unstable gene products at 10 degrees C."

This over expression is not always well tolerated by the metabolic system of the host and in some situations a cellular stress response is encountered. One phenomenon to be avoided during over expression is the accumulation of over expressed proteins into insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies. These aggregated proteins are in general misfolded and thus biologically inactive. This can be avoided in part by slowing down expression rate using low temperatures, indeed, the expression and activity of a number of E. coli chaperones is increased at 30 \u2022 C (Ferrer et al., 2003)(Mogk et al., 2002) hence increasing protein folding efficiency and reducing precipitation into inclusion bodies.

In general, reduced cell growth, caused by lowered temperatures or oxygen limitation, promotes the expression of complex heterologous proteins in an active and soluble form and reduces IB formation (Schein et al., 1988)[9](Kim et al., 1996)(Vasina et al., 1997). Overdrive of inducer, on the other hand, results in IB formation and cell damage, whereas limited induction is favorable for native enzyme production [12]."

Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc."

At 37 degrees C, the fusion protein was produced at high levels from the tac promoter, but aggregated quantitatively in a biologically inactive form. In contrast, little preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase was synthesized from the cspA promoter at this temperature, presumably due to transcript instability. The highest yields of active enzyme were obtained following temperature downshift from 37 to 30 degrees C for the tac promoter and 25 degrees C for the cspA promoter. At 25 degrees C, the kinetics of accumulation of beta-galactosidase activity, ratios of soluble to insoluble fusion protein, and synthesis rates of preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase were virtually identical for both promoters for a period of 2 h postinduction. Thereafter, the cspA promoter became repressed, whereas synthesis of the fusion protein continued with the tac system. Following transfer to 10 degrees C, the tac promoter was almost completely inhibited while the cspA promoter was able to direct the synthesis of soluble preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase for up to 2 h. However, the levels of active enzyme produced were approximately threefold lower than those measured at 25 degrees C. Overexpression of native CspA had no effect on the accumulation of active preS2-S'-beta-galactosidase from the cspA promoter. It is therefore unlikely that CspA acts as it own positive inducer. Our results indicate that the cspA promoter can efficiently substitute for the tac system at 25 degrees C and may be particularly valuable for the expression of highly aggregation-prone or unstable gene products at 10 degrees C."

                            "Previously, we demonstrated production of an active recombinant human N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (rhGALNS) enzyme in Escherichia coli as a potential therapeutic alternative for mucopolysaccharidosis IVA. However, most of the rhGALNS produced was present as protein aggregates. Here, several methods were investigated to improve production and activity of rhGALNS. These methods involved the use of physiologically-regulated promoters and alternatives to improve protein folding including global stress responses (osmotic shock), overexpression of native chaperones, and enhancement of cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation. Increase of rhGALNS activity was obtained when a promoter regulated under \u03c3s was implemented. Additionally, improvements were observed when osmotic shock was applied. Noteworthy, overexpression of chaperones did not have any effect on rhGALNS activity, suggesting that the effect of osmotic shock was probably due to a general stress response and not to the action of an individual chaperone. Finally, it was observed that high concentrations of sucrose in conjunction with the physiological-regulated promoter proUmod significantly increased the rhGALNS production and activity. Together, these results describe advances in the current knowledge on the production of human recombinant enzymes in a prokaryotic system such as E. coli, and could have a significant impact on the development of enzyme replacement therapies for lysosomal storage diseases."

                            "A problem with folding errors that is routinely described in the literature is the inclusion bodies occurrence due to misfolded recombinant proteins. Inclusion bodies are aggregates of biomolecules, mostly proteins, to which the bacteria become more susceptible during the recombinant expression [143]. The physicochemical properties of amino acids, particularly the hydrophobic interactions, are key factors that govern the formation of inclusion bodies [144]. As the RMPs have not undergone natural selection, they might exhibit instability issues, being more prone to form inclusion bodies. Moreover, protein expression at high rates also triggers inclusion body formation, which is a common feature of BL21 derivative strains. For instance, T7 promoters are able to raise recombinant proteins to constitute 50% of total cell proteins within a few hours [145]. The inclusion bodies form more readily under metabolic stress as the production of recombinant and host proteins compete for resources. This contest arises from the overload on DNA replication, the rivalry for transcription and translation elements, and the supplementary energy [146].\n\nThree leading ways to avoid inclusion body formation without involving the RMP redesigning are (') reduce recombinant protein production, (2) use stress-adapted strains, or (3) insert certain adjustments into the RMP's plasmids. The first approach mainly consists of culturing E. coli at lower temperatures (30\u00b0 to 25 \u00b0C), slowing down expression, and enhancing protein stability [147,148]. Furthermore, strains containing plasmids, such as pLysS or pLysE, significantly benefit RMP production by using T7 promoters, preventing inclusion body formation [149]. These plasmids co-express T7 lysozyme, which suppresses transcriptional leak of recombinant genes, an approach adopted for expression of the following RMPs: r-LMP, ITC 8.2, USM.TOXO1, rMEHB, and rMEHCV [2,10,19,31]40]."

                            "Escherichia coli has been the host organism most frequently investigated for efficient recombinant protein production. However, the production of a foreign protein in recombinant E. coli often leads to growth deterioration and elevated secretion of acetic acid. Such observed phenomena have been widely linked with cell stress responses and metabolic burdens originated particularly from the increased energy demand. In this study, flux balance analysis and dynamic flux balance analysis were applied to investigate the observed growth physiology of recombinant E. coli, incorporating the proteome allocation theory and an adjustable maintenance energy level (ATPM) to capture the proteomic and energetic burdens introduced by recombinant protein synthesis. Model predictions of biomass growth, substrate consumption, acetate excretion, and protein production with two different strains were in good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that the constraint on the available proteomic resource and the change in ATPM might be important contributors governing the growth physiology of recombinant strains. The modeling framework developed in this work, currently with several limitations to overcome, offers a starting point for the development of a practical, model\u2010based tool to guide metabolic engineering decisions for boosting recombinant protein production."

One of its most serious limitations is the aggregation of misfolded recombinant proteins which leads to the formation of IBs (Villaverde et al., 2003)(Jaliani et al., 2014). Insoluble IBs are serious obstacles in producing biologically active recombinant proteins. Various approaches have been used to overcome these restrictions, including applying various molecular chaperones (Eiamphungporn et al., 2016) and expression in the periplasmic space (Asghar et al., 2012). In addition, reducing the inducer concentrations and the culture temperature decrease the speed and the level of expression, providing adequate time for proteins to fold correctly (Hu et al., 2007), (Duilio et al., 2004)",

                            "One important limitation for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli is obtaining large amounts of soluble and functional proteins. Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within producing bacteria. The production of soluble proteins under native conditions is essential for functional and structural analyses. Therefore, many studies have focused on optimising processes in protein expression (see (Peti et al., 2007). One possibility is the solubilisation of proteins from inclusion bodies, but it usually requires denaturing conditions, and the subsequent renaturing step can prove difficult. Several experimental approaches have been developed to prevent these aggregates from forming, which include the use of cold inducible expression systems (Qing et al. 2004, Thuy Le and(Le et al., 2007), to increase the intracellular concentration of molecular chaperones (Mogk et al., 2002), to reduce the IPTG concentration for induction (Winograd et al., 1993), to induce the expression in a late log phase culture (Masabanda et al., 2003), and to lower the growth temperature of induced cultures (Schein et al., 1988)Noteborn 1988, Vera et al. 2007)."

The most effective approaches often combine multiple chaperone systems like DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES, though success varies depending on the target protein. (11 sources)",
                "text": "\nMolecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the proper folding of nascent polypeptides during protein synthesis, making their co-expression a powerful strategy to reduce inclusion body formation in E. coli <Paper corpusId=\"10684903\" paperTitle=\"(Kuczynska-Wisnik et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6392822\" paperTitle=\"(Marco et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>. When recombinant proteins are overexpressed, the cell's endogenous chaperones can become titrated out, unable to cope with the excessive load of unfolded proteins <Paper corpusId=\"15379654\" paperTitle=\"(Kolaj et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This creates a strong rationale for supplementing the cell with additional folding machinery through chaperone co-expression.\n\nThe most commonly employed chaperone systems in E. coli include GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, and Trigger factor <Paper corpusId=\"196660066\" paperTitle=\"(Al-hejin et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. These can be used individually or in combination to enhance protein solubility. The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is particularly efficient at enhancing protein refolding and preventing degradation, while Trigger factor can interact with GroEL to improve substrate binding and protein folding <Paper corpusId=\"196660066\" paperTitle=\"(Al-hejin et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system has proven valuable for many recombinant proteins. For example, Valdez-Cruz et al. reported that co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE significantly increased the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, while DnaJ overexpression alone improved soluble transglutaminase content <Paper corpusId=\"469333\" paperTitle=\"(Valdez-Cruz et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"34229192\" paperTitle=\"(Yokoyama et al., 1998)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Nazari et al. found that co-expressing a plasmid carrying dnaK-dnaJ-grpE-groES-groEL with a single-chain antibody fragment increased solubility by up to 54% <Paper corpusId=\"222223466\" paperTitle=\"(Nazari et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRather than using single chaperones, the most impressive results often come from coordinated co-expression of multiple chaperone systems. Marco et al. developed a two-step procedure that showed remarkable enhancement of protein solubility. First, four chaperone systems (GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB, and the small heat shock proteins IbpA/IbpB) were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone-mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins. This approach increased the solubility of 70% of the 64 different heterologous proteins tested, with improvements of up to 42-fold <Paper corpusId=\"6392822\" paperTitle=\"(Marco et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSadeghian-Rizi et al. developed an innovative two-step expression system that balanced protein production rates and cellular stress. Using GFP as a model protein, they first expressed it under control of a T7-TetO promoter alongside the DnaK/J/GrpE chaperone system. Then, when inclusion bodies began to accumulate, the TetR repressor was automatically activated by a stress promoter (ibpAB), suppressing GFP production and allowing time for refolding of incorrectly folded proteins <Paper corpusId=\"204538582\" paperTitle=\"(Sadeghian-Rizi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor proteins requiring disulfide bonds, periplasmic chaperones like DsbC and FkpA can be expressed in the cytoplasm without their signal sequences to improve protein folding <Paper corpusId=\"196660066\" paperTitle=\"(Al-hejin et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Co-expression of periplasmic chaperones Skp and FkpA has been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments <Paper corpusId=\"19260060\" paperTitle=\"(Levy et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these successes, it's important to note that no universal chaperone system works for all proteins <Paper corpusId=\"6380682\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Individual chaperones often handle specific protein substrates, making it difficult to predict which system will work best for a particular protein. Complete prevention of inclusion body formation remains challenging, with many approaches offering only partial solutions <Paper corpusId=\"264614455\" paperTitle=\"(Alibolandi et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Therefore, researchers typically need to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient system for their target protein <Paper corpusId=\"196660066\" paperTitle=\"(Al-hejin et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8]9]."

                            "One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012). The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies (Arya et al., 2015)(Marco, 2007)(Cui et al., 2011)(Levy et al., 2001). The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding (Folwarczna et al., 2012). Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins (Guzzo, 2012). It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32]",
                            "Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins."

Although the solubility of the gene products could be improved by cultivation at a lower temperature (26-28 degrees C), most of the synthesized TGase was still in the form of insoluble aggregates. The effects of overproduction of molecular chaperones on the intracellular solubility of newly produced recombinant TGase were examined. The overexpression of dnaK or groES/EL did not improve solubility. However, DnaJ greatly increased the solubility of the recombinant TGase, resulting in active enzyme in the presence of calcium ions. Co-expression of dnaK along with dnaJ further increased the content of soluble TGase. Under our experimental conditions, supplementation with both DnaJ and DnaK elevated the TGase activity in the producer cells by roughly 4-fold, compared with the control strain cultured at 30 degrees C. Thus, we found that DnaJ is important in controlling the solubility of protein overproduced in E. coli."

One of its most serious limitations is the aggregation of misfolded recombinant proteins which leads to the formation of IBs (Villaverde et al., 2003)(Jaliani et al., 2014). Insoluble IBs are serious obstacles in producing biologically active recombinant proteins. Various approaches have been used to overcome these restrictions, including applying various molecular chaperones (Eiamphungporn et al., 2016) and expression in the periplasmic space (Asghar et al., 2012). In addition, reducing the inducer concentrations and the culture temperature decrease the speed and the level of expression, providing adequate time for proteins to fold correctly (Hu et al., 2007), (Duilio et al., 2004)",

Co-expression of chaperon systems accompanied by recombinant protein is a general method to increase the production yield. However, it has not been successful enough due to imposed intense stress to the host cells. The aim of this study was to balance the rate of protein production and the imposed cellular stresses using a two-step expression system. For this purpose, in the first step, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed as a recombinant protein model under control of the T7-TetO artificial promoter-operator, accompanied by Dnak/J/GrpE chaperon system. Then, in the next step, TetR repressor was activated automatically under the control of the stress promoter ibpAB and suppressed the GFP production after accumulation of inclusion bodies. Thus in this step incorrect folded proteins and inclusion bodies are refolded causing increased yield and solubility of the recombinant protein and restarting GFP expression again."

Recently, we showed that in Escherichia coli trxB gor mutants, in which the reduction of thioredoxin and glutathione is impaired, the redox potential of the cytoplasm becomes comparable to that of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum, thus allowing the formation of disulfide bonds in certain complex proteins (P. H. Bessette et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 13703-13708]. Here, we investigate the expression of a Fab antibody fragment in the bacterial cytoplasm. The effect of coexpressing cytoplasmic chaperones (GroEL/ES, trigger factor, DnaK/J), as well as signal sequenceless versions of periplasmic chaperones (DsbC and Skp), was examined. Skp coexpression was shown to have the most significant effect (five- to sixfold increase) on the yield of correctly folded Fab. A maximum yield of 0.8 mg Fab/L/OD(600) Fab was obtained, indicating that cytoplasmic expression may be a viable alternative for the preparative production of antibody fragments."

(1988, Gene 74, 365-373), we have constructed expression vectors which contain a sequence encoding six consecutive histidine residues (His6-tag) at the 3' end of the MBP-encoding malE gene which is followed by either a thrombin-binding site (LVPRGS) or a factor Xa-binding site (IEGR). The benefits of this approach include; (a) high expression levels of soluble MBP fusion proteins (exceeding 2% of the total cellular protein), (b) high-quality purification of proteins under various conditions (high salt, low salt, denaturing, nondenaturing, etc.), and (c) two alternative protease cleavage sites to test for the most efficient cleavage of each fusion protein. We also constructed these MBP-His 6-tag expression vectors with alternative selection markers (Ampr, Kanr) and alternative promoters (tac, T7). Using these constructs, we expressed and purified several proteins of which we present two, penicillin-binding protein PBP2a and UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase (MurC), and compare their expression level and purity with other expression systems. We also discuss the use of minimal media with supplements versus rich media and cell growth strategies to optimize the protein yield in general and for isotope labeling."

To date, Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST), E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), E. coli N-utilization substance A (NusA), and E. coli thioredoxin are commonly used as fusion partners to prevent inclusion body formation (Esposito et al., 2006). Although fusion partners provide a general protective effect against insoluble aggregation, some soluble fusions lack detectable activities (Sachdev et al., 1999). These soluble aggregates are formed by agglomeration of misfolded proteins of interest, while precipitation is prevented by the presence of the soluble fusion partners (Nomin\u00e9 et al., 2001)."

                            "Despite the availability of efficient transcription and translation signals, some heterologous gene products are not adequately expressed when introduced into prokaryotes and eukaryotes. An expression system has been established in Escherichia coli to increase the yield of cloned gene products, where the C terminus of ubiquitin was fused to the N terminus of unstable or poorly expressed proteins. Fusion of ubiquitin to yeast metallothionein or to the alpha subunit of the adenylate cyclase-stimulatory GTP-binding protein increased the yield from undetectable to 20% of the total cellular protein. A ubiquitin-N alpha-protein hydrolase has been partially purified from rabbit reticulocytes; this enzyme faithfully cleaves the junction peptide bound between the C-terminal Gly-76 of ubiquitin and the fusion protein. The increased yield of cloned gene products is very likely due to increased stability and/or more efficient translation of the fusion proteins. Possible mechanisms for the augmentation of ubiquitin fusion-protein expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are discussed."

                            "Despite the availability of numerous gene fusion systems, recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli remains difficult. Establishing the best fusion partner for difficult\u2010to\u2010express proteins remains empirical. To determine which fusion tags are best suited for difficult\u2010to\u2010express proteins, a comparative analysis of the newly described SUMO fusion system with a variety of commonly used fusion systems was completed. For this study, three model proteins, enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP), matrix metalloprotease\u201013 (MMP13), and myostatin (growth differentiating factor\u20108, GDF8), were fused to the C termini of maltose\u2010binding protein (MBP), glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST), thioredoxin (TRX), NUS A, ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO tags. These constructswere expressed in E. coli and evaluated for expression and solubility. As expected, the fusion tags varied in their ability to produce tractable quantities of soluble eGFP, MMP13, and GDF8. SUMO and NUS A fusions enhanced expression and solubility of recombinant proteins most dramatically. The ease at which SUMO and NUS A fusion tags were removed from their partner proteins was then determined. SUMO fusions are cleaved by the natural SUMO protease, while an AcTEV protease site had to be engineered between NUS A and its partner protein. A kinetic analysis showed that the SUMO and AcTEV proteases had similarKM values, but SUMOprotease had a 25\u2010fold higher kcat than AcTEV protease, indicating a more catalytically efficient enzyme. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SUMO is superior to commonly used fusion tags in enhancing expression and solubility with the distinction of generating recombinant protein with native sequences."

In addition, several fusion tags have been developed to increase the solubility of overexpressed proteins, although with variable degrees of success. Currently, available fusion systems include maltose-binding polypeptide (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ubiquitin (SUMO), thioredoxin (TrxA), and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (Kaur et al., 2018).

                            "One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012). The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies (Arya et al., 2015)(Marco, 2007)(Cui et al., 2011)(Levy et al., 2001). The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding (Folwarczna et al., 2012). Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins (Guzzo, 2012). It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32]",
                            "Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins."

                            "Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1) is a recently characterized corneal crystallin with its exact functions still being unclear. Expressing recombinant human ALDH3A1 has been difficult in Escherichia coli (E. coli) because of low solubility, yield and insufficient purity issues. In this report, we compared different E. coli expression strategies (namely the maltose binding protein; MBP- and the 6-his-tagged expression systems) under conditions of auto-induction and co-expression with E. coli\u2019s molecular chaperones where appropriate. Thus, we aimed to screen the efficiency of these expression strategies in order to improve solubility of recombinant ALDH3A1 when expressed in E. coli. We showed that the MBP- tagged expression in combination with lower-temperature culture conditions resulted in active soluble recombinant ALDH3A1. Expression of the fused 6-his tagged-ALDH3A1 protein resulted in poor solubility and neither lowering temperature culture conditions nor the auto-induction strategy improved its solubility. Furthermore, higher yield of soluble, active native form of 6-his tagged-ALDH3A1 was facilitated through co-expression of the two groups of E. coli\u2019s molecular chaperones, GroES/GroEL and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. Convenient one step immobilized affinity chromatography methods were utilized to purify the fused ALDH3A1 hybrids. Both fusion proteins retained their biological activity and could be used directly without removing the fusion tags. Taken together, our results provide a rational option for producing sufficient amounts of soluble and active recombinant ALDH3A1 using the E. coli expression system for conducting functional studies towards elucidating the biological role(s) of this interesting corneal crystallin."

                            "One of the best strategies to overcome this problem is to use fusion proteins, e. g. DsbA, as used in this research. DsbA is an enzyme that can assist disulfide bond formation in nascent polypeptide chains (Ke et al., 2014). \n\nAnother strategy for the prevention of inclusion body formation is the co-expression of molecular chaperones. As molecular chaperones are involved in the protein-folding process, their over-expression was usually carried out in order to increase the stability and solubility of the produced target recombinant protein (Marco et al., 2007)Tegel et al., 2011;(Makhoba et al., 2015)(Gounel et al., 2016). E. coli cytoplasm involves three chaperone systems: trigger factor, DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES (Voziyan et al., 1998;(Baneyx et al., 2004). Newly-synthesized proteins in bacteria are associated with the chaperone trigger factor as soon as they leave the exit tunnel of the ribosome (Deuerling et al., 1999)Valent et al., 1997;(Schaffitzel et al., 2001)."

                            "Many polypeptides overexpressed in bacteria are produced misfolded and accumulate as solid structures called inclusion bodies. Inclusion-body-prone proteins have often been reported to escape precipitation when fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP). Here, we have examined the case of HPV 16 oncoprotein E6. The unfused sequence of E6 is overexpressed as inclusion bodies in bacteria. By contrast, fusions of E6 to the C-terminus of MBP are produced soluble. We have analyzed preparations of soluble MBP-E6 fusions by using three independent approaches: dynamic light scattering, lateral turbidimetry, and sandwich ELISA. All three methods showed that MBP-E6 preparations contain highly aggregated material. The behavior of these soluble aggregates under denaturating conditions suggests that they are formed by agglomeration of misfolded E6 moieties. However, precipitation is prevented by the presence of the folded and highly soluble MBP moieties, which maintain the aggregates in solution. Therefore, the fact that a protein or protein domain is produced soluble when fused to the C-terminus of a carrier protein does not guarantee that the protein of interest is properly folded and active. We suggest that aggregation of fusion proteins should be systematically assayed, especially when these fusions are to be used for binding measurements or activity tests."

Chemical chaperones, usually osmolytes, help cells counter unfavorable physiological conditions by stabilizing the native folding state of proteins and destabilizing partially folded states and early aggregates (Ignatova et al., 2006). Cyclodextrins have recently been shown to be efficient chemical chaperones, assisting protein refolding and suppressing the misfolding and aggregation of proteins both in vitro and in vivo (Jono et al., 2011)(Aachmann et al., 2003)."

                            "TTR (transthyretin), a \u03b2-sheet-rich protein, is the precursor protein of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis. Although it has been widely accepted that protein misfolding of the monomeric form of TTR is a rate-limiting step for amyloid formation, no effective therapy targeting this misfolding step is available. In the present study, we focused on CyDs (cyclodextrins), cyclic oligosaccharides composed of glucose units, and reported the inhibitory effect of CyDs on TTR amyloid formation. Of various branched \u03b2-CyDs, GUG-\u03b2-CyD [6-O-\u03b1-(4-O-\u03b1-D-glucuronyl)-D-glucosyl-\u03b2-CyD] showed potent inhibition of TTR amyloid formation. Far-UV CD spectra analysis showed that GUG-\u03b2-CyD reduced the conformational change of TTR in the process of amyloid formation. In addition, tryptophan fluorescence and 1H-NMR spectroscopy analyses indicated that GUG-\u03b2-CyD stabilized the TTR conformation via interaction with the hydrophobic amino acids of TTR, especially tryptophan. Moreover, GUG-\u03b2-CyD exerted its inhibitory effect by reducing TTR deposition in transgenic rats possessing a human variant TTR gene in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that GUG-\u03b2-CyD may inhibit TTR misfolding by stabilizing its conformation, which, in turn, suppresses TTR amyloid formation."

Their exterior is hydrophilic and their cavity is hydrophobic, which gives cyclodextrins the ability to accommodate hydrophobic molecules/moieties in the cavity. This special molecular arrangement accounts for the variety of beneficial effects cyclodextrins have on proteins, which is widely used in pharmacological applications. We have studied the interaction between beta-cyclodextrin and four non-carbohydrate-binding model proteins: ubiquitin, chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), S6 and insulin SerB9Asp by NMR spectroscopy at varying structural detail. We demonstrate that the interaction of beta-cyclodextrin and our model proteins takes place at specific sites on the protein surface, and that solvent accessibility of those sites is a necessary but not compelling condition for the occurrence of an interaction. If this behaviour can be generalized, it might explain the wide range of different effects of cyclodextrins on different proteins: aggregation suppression (if residues responsible for aggregation are highly solvent accessible), protection against degradation (if point of attack of a protease is sterically 'masked' by cyclodextrin), alteration of function (if residues involved in function are 'masked' by cyclodextrin). The exact effect of cyclodextrins on a given protein will always be related to the particular structure of this protein."

In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins (Francis et al., 2010). Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies",

To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented (Bondos et al., 2003). We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure. As shown in Figure 2A, the use of Triton X-100 significantly increased the solubility of hGH expressed at low temperature."

                            "Excessive production of heterologous proteins in E. coli often leads to their improper folding and/or aggregation with the formation of inclusion bodies. This problem can be solved by optimizing the cultivation and induction conditions; however, it is almost impossible to find suitable conditions for hydrophobic proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Typically, different approaches for converting inclusion bodies into a biologically active protein rarely provide sufficient refolded protein yield without proper optimization. The second stage of optimization was aimed to evaluate the effect of chemical additives on the refolding efficiency. Various chemical additives to the standard refolding buffer allow for a complex effect on the refolding process. Redox pairs of substances, such as glutathione, cysteine/cystine, accelerate the \"shuffling\" of disulfide bonds and reduce the refolding time (Hudson et al., 2015). Glycerol acts as a stabilizer of protein molecules by increasing the order of solvent molecules around the proteins. Increasing the concentration of glycerol improves the stability of the enzyme even at high protein concentrations. Although stabilizers such as glycerol or polyethylene glycol increase yield during refolding, protein aggregation can occur concurrently. Therefore, these types of supplements have always been used in combination with an aggregation inhibitor such as arginine (Yamaguchi et al., 2014) or proline (Alibolandi et al., 2011)."

In vitro refolding of inclusion body into proteins with native conformations is a solution for this problem but there is a need for optimization of condition for each protein specifically. Several approaches have been described for in vitro refolding; most of them involve the use of additives for assisting correct folding. Cosolutes play a major role in refolding process and can be classified according to their function as aggregation suppressors and folding enhancers.

                            "Progress in our understanding of several biological processes promises to broaden the usefulness of Escherichia coli as a tool for gene expression. There is an expanding choice of tightly regulated prokaryotic promoters suitable for achieving high-level gene expression. New host strains facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and offer higher protein yields by minimizing proteolytic degradation. Insights into the process of protein translocation across the bacterial membranes may eventually make it possible to achieve robust secretion of specific proteins into the culture medium. Studies involving molecular chaperones have shown that in specific cases, chaperones can be very effective for improved protein folding, solubility, and membrane transport. Negative results derived from such studies are also instructive in formulating different strategies. The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that \"rare\" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes. Finally, the elucidation of specific determinants of protein degradation, a plethora of protease-deficient host strains, and methods to stabilize proteins afford new strategies to minimize proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins in E. coli."

The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium (Strandberg et al., 1991). The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing (Baneyx, 1999)(Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010)(Choi et al., 2004)(Wong, 1999)(Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005)(Missiakas et al., 1997), although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm (Bowden et al., 1991)(Hunke et al., 2003). The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins (Berndt et al., 2008)(Chen et al., 1999)(Merdanovic et al., 2011)(Shao et al., 2000). Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins (Ari\u00e9 et al., 2001)(Kadokura et al., 2001)(Zhang et al., 2003). Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22]."

                            "Production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bond for therapeutic, diagnostic and various other purposes is a challenging task of research. Production of such proteins in the reducing cytosolic compartment of E. coli usually ends up in inclusion bodies formation. Refolding of inclusion bodies can be difficult, time and labor consuming and uneconomical. Translocation of these proteins into the oxidative periplasmic compartment provides correct environment to undergo proper disulfide bonds formation and thus achieving native conformation."

                            "One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012). The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies (Arya et al., 2015)(Marco, 2007)(Cui et al., 2011)(Levy et al., 2001). The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding (Folwarczna et al., 2012). Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins (Guzzo, 2012). It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32]",
                            "Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins."

Stoichiometric amounts of DsbG are sufficient to prevent the thermal aggregation of two classical chaperone substrate proteins, citrate synthase and luciferase. DsbG was also shown to interact with refolding intermediates of chemically denatured citrate synthase and prevents their aggregation in vitro. Citrate synthase reactivation experiments in the presence of DsbG suggest that DsbG binds with high affinity to early unstructured protein folding intermediates. DsbG is one of the first periplasmic proteins shown to have general chaperone activity. This ability to chaperone protein folding is likely to increase the effectiveness of DsbG as a protein disulfide isomerase."

However, DsbC shows more pronounced chaperone activity than does PDI in promoting the in vitroreactivation and suppressing aggregation of denaturedd-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) during refolding. Carboxymethylation of DsbC at Cys98 decreases its intrinsic fluorescence, deprives of its enzyme activities, but lowers only partly its chaperone activity in assisting GAPDH reactivation. Simultaneous presence of DsbC and PDI in the refolding buffer shows an additive effect on the reactivation of GAPDH. The assisted reactivation of GAPDH and the protein disulfide oxidoreductase activity of DsbC can both be inhibited by scrambled andS-carboxymethylated RNases, but not by shorter peptides, including synthetic 10- and 14-mer peptides andS-carboxymethylated insulin A chain. In contrast, all the three peptides and the two nonnative RNases inhibit PDI-assisted GAPDH reactivation and the reductase activity of PDI. DsbC assists refolding of denatured and reduced lysozyme to a higher level than does PDI in phosphate buffer and does not show anti-chaperone activity in HEPES buffer. Like PDI, DsbC is also a disulfide isomerase with chaperone activity but may recognize different folding intermediates as does PDI."

We now report that fusion or co-expression of FkpA, the E. coli periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase with chaperone activity, substantially improves soluble and functional expression of scAbs. Anti-human bladder carcinoma scAb (PG) and anti-human CD3 x anti-human ovarian carcinoma-bispecific scAb (BH1) were fused with FkpA on the pTMF-based plasmid and expressed in E. coli. More than half of the amount of each expressed fusion protein FkpA-PG or FkpA-BH1 was soluble. In addition, the fusion protein cellulose-binding domain from Cellulomonas fimi (CBD)-PG and anti-human CD3 x anti-human CD28 x anti-human ovarian carcinoma-trispecific scAb (TRI) fused to the pelB (a signal peptide from pectate lysase B of a Bacillus sp.) signal sequence were co-expressed with FkpA under the control of the T7 promoter. A substantial portion of the co-expressed CBD-PG or TRI was soluble. Furthermore, PG, BH1, and TRI were biologically active as judged by ELISA and in vitro cytotoxicity assay. These results suggest that overexpression of FkpA should be useful in expressing heterologous proteins in E. coli."

Overexpression of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) increased transcription of degP by twofold. To examine the significance of its induction, we overexpressed PhoA in a mutant strain deficient in the degP gene. Upon PhoA overexpression, the degP mutant produced a smaller amount of active PhoA, about one half of the enzymatic activity of its isogenic wild-type strain, and accumulated a larger amount of its precursor, indicating that degP is required for efficient export of overexpressed PhoA. Pulse-chase experiment showed that PhoA overexpression in the absence of degP causes a severe defect in the export of several proteins tested. Examination of the synthesis and the accumulation of the phoA gene products revealed that a part of them, synthesized in the wild-type strain, undergoes relatively rapid proteolysis and that degP is necessary for such a process. From these results, we discuss a possible role of DegP in facilitating protein export under stress conditions."

H. Bessette et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 13703-13708]. Here, we investigate the expression of a Fab antibody fragment in the bacterial cytoplasm. The effect of coexpressing cytoplasmic chaperones (GroEL/ES, trigger factor, DnaK/J), as well as signal sequenceless versions of periplasmic chaperones (DsbC and Skp), was examined. Skp coexpression was shown to have the most significant effect (five- to sixfold increase) on the yield of correctly folded Fab. A maximum yield of 0.8 mg Fab/L/OD(600) Fab was obtained, indicating that cytoplasmic expression may be a viable alternative for the preparative production of antibody fragments."

                            "AbstractBackgroundThe production of therapeutically active single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody is still challenging in E. coli due to the aggregation propensity of recombinant protein into inclusion bodies (IBs). However, recent advancement of biotechnology has shown substantial recovery of bioactive protein from such insoluble IBs by solubilization and refolding processes. In addition, gene fusion technology has also widely been used to improve the soluble protein production using E. coli. This study demonstrates that mild-solubilization and in vitro refolding strategies, both are capable to recover soluble scFv protein from bacterial IBs, although the degree of success is greatly influenced by different fusion tags with the target protein.ResultsIt was observed that the most commonly used fusion tag, i.e., maltose binding protein (MBP) was not only influenced the cytoplasmic expression in E. coli but also greatly improved the in vitro refolding yield of scFv protein. On the other hand, mild solubilization process potentially could recover soluble and functional scFv protein from non-classical IBs without assistance of any fusion tag and in vitro refolding step. The recovery yield achieved by mild solubilization process was also found higher than denaturation\u2013refolding method except while scFv was refolded in fusion with MBP tag. Concomitantly, it was also observed that the soluble protein achieved by mild solubilization\nprocess was better structured and functionally more active than the one achieved by in vitro refolding method in the absence of MBP tag or refolding enhancer.ConclusionsMaltose binding protein tagged scFv has shown better refolding and solubility yields as compare to mild solubilization process. However, in terms of cost, time and tag free nature, mild solubilization method for scFv recovery from bacterial IBs is considerable for therapeutic application and further structural studies."

However, over-production of heterologous proteins in E. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO)."

Alternatively, co-expression of molecular chaperones can result in proper folding in E. coli.

The process of obtaining bioactive protein from inclusion bodies is labor intensive and the yields of recombinant protein are often low. Here we review the developments in the field that are targeted at improving the yield, as well as quality of the recombinant protein by optimizing the individual steps of the process, especially solubilization of the inclusion bodies and refolding of the solubilized protein. Mild solubilization methods have been discussed which are based on the understanding of the fact that protein molecules in inclusion body aggregates have native-like structure. These methods solubilize the inclusion body aggregates while preserving the native-like protein structure. Subsequent protein refolding and purification results in high recovery of bioactive protein. Other parameters which influence the overall recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies have also been discussed. A schematic model describing the utility of mild solubilization methods for high throughput recovery of bioactive protein has also been presented."

                            "Inclusion bodies produced in Escherichia coli are composed of densely packed denatured protein molecules in the form of particles. Refolding of inclusion body proteins into bioactive forms is cumbersome, results in poor recovery and accounts for the major cost in production of recombinant proteins from E. coli. With new information available on the structure and function of protein aggregates in bacterial inclusion bodies, it has been possible to develop improved solubilization and refolding procedures for higher recovery of bioactive protein. Inclusion bodies are formed from partially folded protein intermediates and are composed of aggregates of mostly single types of polypeptide. This helps to isolate and purify the protein aggregates to homogeneity before solubilization and refolding. Proteins inside inclusion body aggregates have native-like secondary structures. It is assumed that restoration of this native-like secondary structure using mild solubilization conditions will help in improved recovery of bioactive protein in comparison to solubilization using a high concentration of chaotropic agent. Analysis of the dominant forces causing aggregation during inclusion body formation provides information to develop suitable mild solubilization procedures for inclusion body proteins. Refolding from such solubilized protein will be very high due to restoration of native-like secondary structure. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies were purified to homogeneity from E. coli cells before solubilization and refolding. Pure inclusion bodies were solubilized at alkaline pH in the presence of 2 M urea solution. The solubilized proteins were refolded using a pulsatile renaturation process and subsequently purified using chromatographic procedures. More than 40% of the inclusion body proteins could be refolded back to the bioactive native conformation. Mild solubilization is thus the key for high recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies."

                            "Single chain variable fragment antibodies (scFvs) have attracted many attentions due to their small size, faster bio-distribution and better penetration in to the target tissues, and ease of expression in Escherichia coli. Although, scFv expression in E. coli usually leads to formation of inclusion bodies (IBs). The aim of this research was to improve solubilizing and refolding conditions for IBs of scFv version of pertuzumab (anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody). After protein overexpression in E. coli BL21 (DE3), bacterial cells were lysed and IBs were extracted via repeated washing and centrifugation. The effect of different types, concentrations, pHs, and additive of denaturing agents on IBs solubility were evaluated. More than 40 refolding additives were screened and combinations of 10 of the best additives were check out using Plackett-Burman design to choose three refolding additives with the most positive effect on refolding of the scFv. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the concentration of adopted additives. The most efficient buffer to solubilize IBs was a buffer containing 6 M urea with 6 mM beta mercaptoethanol, pH 11. The optimum concentration of three buffer additives for refolding of the scFv was 23 mM tricine, 0.55 mM arginine, and 14.3 mM imidazole. The bioactivity of the refolded scFv was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer tissue, a specific binding based method. The systematic optimization of refolding buffer developed in the present work will contribute to improve the refolding of other scFv fragments."

In order to obtain large quantities of active falcipain-2 for biochemical and structural analysis, a systematic assessment of optimal parameters for the expression and refolding of the protease was carried out. High-yield expression was achieved using M15(pREP4) Escherichia coli transformed with the pQE-30 plasmid containing a truncated profalcipain-2 construct. Recombinant falcipain-2 was expressed as inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A systematic approach was then used to optimize refolding parameters. This approach utilized 100-fold dilutions of reduced and denatured falcipain-2 into 203 different buffers in a microtiter plate format. Refolding efficiency varied markedly. Optimal refolding was obtained in an alkaline buffer containing glycerol or sucrose and equal concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione. After optimization of the expression and refolding protocols and additional purification with anion-exchange chromatography, 12 mg of falcipain-2 was obtained from 5 liters of E. coli, and crystals of the protease were grown. The systematic approach described here allowed the rapid evaluation of a large number of expression and refolding conditions and provided milligram quantities of recombinant falcipain-2."

                            "Among the available expression hosts, E. coli remains the most attractive one for production of heterologous proteins for a variety of downstream utilization. Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Pacheco et al., 2012). However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020). Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein (Sijwali et al., 2001). So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins (Salehinia et al., 2018). Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host. Varying several parameters such as fusion partners, post induction temperature, promoters, or E. coli strains have been reported to be able to alleviate the insolubility problem and increase the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [15]."

                            "Excessive production of heterologous proteins in E. coli often leads to their improper folding and/or aggregation with the formation of inclusion bodies. This problem can be solved by optimizing the cultivation and induction conditions; however, it is almost impossible to find suitable conditions for hydrophobic proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Typically, different approaches for converting inclusion bodies into a biologically active protein rarely provide sufficient refolded protein yield without proper optimization. The second stage of optimization was aimed to evaluate the effect of chemical additives on the refolding efficiency. Various chemical additives to the standard refolding buffer allow for a complex effect on the refolding process. Redox pairs of substances, such as glutathione, cysteine/cystine, accelerate the \"shuffling\" of disulfide bonds and reduce the refolding time (Hudson et al., 2015). Glycerol acts as a stabilizer of protein molecules by increasing the order of solvent molecules around the proteins. Increasing the concentration of glycerol improves the stability of the enzyme even at high protein concentrations. Although stabilizers such as glycerol or polyethylene glycol increase yield during refolding, protein aggregation can occur concurrently. Therefore, these types of supplements have always been used in combination with an aggregation inhibitor such as arginine (Yamaguchi et al., 2014) or proline (Alibolandi et al., 2011)."

In vitro refolding of inclusion body into proteins with native conformations is a solution for this problem but there is a need for optimization of condition for each protein specifically. Several approaches have been described for in vitro refolding; most of them involve the use of additives for assisting correct folding. Cosolutes play a major role in refolding process and can be classified according to their function as aggregation suppressors and folding enhancers. This paper presents a review of additives that are used in refolding process of insoluble recombinant proteins in small scale and industrial processes."

                            "Antibodies have been used for basic research, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic applications. Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies. Variable antibody genes have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteines. However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity."

The optimal approach balances solubility-enhancing methods with sufficient production levels, often requiring protein-specific optimization. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhile the strategies described in previous sections can successfully reduce inclusion body formation, they often impact the overall yield and quality of recombinant proteins in complex ways. Most approaches that enhance protein solubility do so by slowing down protein synthesis, which inevitably reduces the total protein output <Paper corpusId=\"112829\" paperTitle=\"(Schumann et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, lower temperatures significantly improve protein folding but decrease bacterial growth rates and overall protein expression levels <Paper corpusId=\"112829\" paperTitle=\"(Schumann et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, reduced inducer concentrations promote proper folding at the expense of total protein production <Paper corpusId=\"13571021\" paperTitle=\"(Spadiut et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe quality of recombinant proteins, however, often improves dramatically when inclusion body formation is prevented. Proteins expressed as soluble fractions typically exhibit higher specific activity compared to those recovered from inclusion bodies <Paper corpusId=\"112829\" paperTitle=\"(Schumann et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Terol et al. observed that expression systems using the PBAD promoter produced lower total protein amounts but significantly reduced the insoluble fraction compared to other expression systems <Paper corpusId=\"235487030\" paperTitle=\"(Terol et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This trade-off between quantity and quality is central to optimizing recombinant protein production.\n\nThe impact of prevention strategies on protein yield varies considerably depending on the target protein's characteristics. For particularly aggregation-prone proteins, even optimal expression conditions may result in low yields of soluble protein, necessitating multiple complementary approaches <Paper corpusId=\"205388238\" paperTitle=\"(Rinas et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, combining lower temperatures with fusion tags can provide synergistic benefits, as demonstrated by Kim et al., who achieved significant increases in soluble human growth hormone through low-temperature induction (16-20\u00b0C) combined with non-ionic detergents <Paper corpusId=\"650400\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhen inclusion bodies do form despite prevention efforts, recovery methods can significantly impact final protein quality. Traditional refolding from inclusion bodies using harsh denaturants often results in poor recovery and compromised activity <Paper corpusId=\"231819880\" paperTitle=\"(Javadian et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, mild solubilization methods that preserve native-like secondary structures have enabled recovery of over 40% of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies <Paper corpusId=\"231819880\" paperTitle=\"(Javadian et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"13853161\" paperTitle=\"(Singh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor proteins requiring disulfide bonds, particularly antibody fragments, the quality challenge is even greater. These proteins often require elaborate refolding processes with optimal concentrations of chaotropic agents and redox pairs to obtain correctly folded structures <Paper corpusId=\"221078071\" paperTitle=\"(Ban et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. In such cases, periplasmic expression combined with specialized chaperones may provide better quality despite potentially lower yields <Paper corpusId=\"196660066\" paperTitle=\"(Al-hejin et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNovel approaches that balance protein production rates with cellular stress can potentially optimize both yield and quality. Sadeghian-Rizi et al. developed a two-step expression system that first produces the target protein alongside chaperones, then automatically suppresses protein production when stress indicators appear, allowing time for proper folding <Paper corpusId=\"204538582\" paperTitle=\"(Sadeghian-Rizi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, auto-induction methods that gradually induce protein expression can reduce metabolic burden and improve folding while maintaining reasonable yields <Paper corpusId=\"264891640\" paperTitle=\"(Schutz et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite numerous advances, no universal approach exists that optimizes both yield and quality for all proteins <Paper corpusId=\"231819880\" paperTitle=\"(Javadian et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Researchers typically need to test different strategies for each target protein, often requiring a compromise between maximal yield and highest quality <Paper corpusId=\"247981586\" paperTitle=\"(Remans et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The most successful approaches balance production rate with the cell's folding capacity, ensuring that expression levels do not overwhelm the available folding machinery <Paper corpusId=\"235466155\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc."

In particular, protein expression at low temperature often significantly improves the solubility of recombinant proteins (Francis et al., 2010). Indeed, we observed that induction at lower temperatures (16-20uC) significantly increased the amount of soluble hGH without modifying our protein extraction method (Figure 1A), indicating that a slow induction of hGH efficiently reduced the formation of inclusion bodies",

To reduce such interactions and facilitate protein solubility, a number of useful buffer additives have been identified and efficiently implemented (Bondos et al., 2003). We first tested the effects of mild non-ionic detergents including Triton X-100 and Tween 20 since they are unlikely to disrupt protein structure. As shown in Figure 2A, the use of Triton X-100 significantly increased the solubility of hGH expressed at low temperature."

                            "Among the available expression hosts, E. coli remains the most attractive one for production of heterologous proteins for a variety of downstream utilization. Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Pacheco et al., 2012). However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020). Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein (Sijwali et al., 2001). So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins (Salehinia et al., 2018). Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host. Varying several parameters such as fusion partners, post induction temperature, promoters, or E. coli strains have been reported to be able to alleviate the insolubility problem and increase the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [15]."

The process of obtaining bioactive protein from inclusion bodies is labor intensive and the yields of recombinant protein are often low. Here we review the developments in the field that are targeted at improving the yield, as well as quality of the recombinant protein by optimizing the individual steps of the process, especially solubilization of the inclusion bodies and refolding of the solubilized protein. Mild solubilization methods have been discussed which are based on the understanding of the fact that protein molecules in inclusion body aggregates have native-like structure. These methods solubilize the inclusion body aggregates while preserving the native-like protein structure. Subsequent protein refolding and purification results in high recovery of bioactive protein. Other parameters which influence the overall recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies have also been discussed. A schematic model describing the utility of mild solubilization methods for high throughput recovery of bioactive protein has also been presented."

                            "Antibodies have been used for basic research, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic applications. Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies. Variable antibody genes have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteines. However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity."

                            "One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012). The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies (Arya et al., 2015)(Marco, 2007)(Cui et al., 2011)(Levy et al., 2001). The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding (Folwarczna et al., 2012). Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins (Guzzo, 2012). It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32]",
                            "Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins."

Co-expression of chaperon systems accompanied by recombinant protein is a general method to increase the production yield. However, it has not been successful enough due to imposed intense stress to the host cells. The aim of this study was to balance the rate of protein production and the imposed cellular stresses using a two-step expression system. For this purpose, in the first step, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed as a recombinant protein model under control of the T7-TetO artificial promoter-operator, accompanied by Dnak/J/GrpE chaperon system. Then, in the next step, TetR repressor was activated automatically under the control of the stress promoter ibpAB and suppressed the GFP production after accumulation of inclusion bodies. Thus in this step incorrect folded proteins and inclusion bodies are refolded causing increased yield and solubility of the recombinant protein and restarting GFP expression again."

                            "Aggregation of cysteine-rich proteins usually results in inclusion body formation as the reduced state in the cytoplasm makes forming the disulfide bonds difficult (which enable proper folding). A variety of methods have been reported to tackle these issues, for instance, optimizing culture and purification conditions (Kiedzierska et al., 2008), recovering and re-folding active proteins from inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015), expression in the periplasm, and many others (Ban et al., 2020). In addition to this array of strategies, in this study we have coupled two, somewhat disjoint methodologies, but when combined lead to significantly increased yields of soluble protein. \n\nFirst, we sought to reduce inclusion body formation with an autoinduction method mediated by rewiring the genetic circuitry of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) so that instead of mediating endogenous QS functions like biofilm formation, we engineered cells to induce expression of genes-of-interest. Overexpression of a recombinant protein is often accompanied by an imbalance of metabolism, often referred to as a \"metabolic burden\" (Bentley et al., 1990). In addition, the induction process is typically initiated by the addition of a bolus of inducer, which, in turn, can bring about significant transients in precursors or energy levels (Harcum et al., 1993)(Ramirez et al., 1995)(DeLisa et al., 2001). This imposed stress could exhaust the bacterium's innate protein folding and quality control machinery, leading to improperly folded proteins that aggregate and form inclusion bodies or get targeted for degradation."
