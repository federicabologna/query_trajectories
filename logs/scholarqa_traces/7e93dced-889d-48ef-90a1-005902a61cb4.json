These methods can achieve cell concentrations in excess of 100 g (dry cell weight)/liter and can provide cost-effective production of recombinant proteins. Detailed reviews of largescale fermentation systems have been published (338,607,614).

The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli is a very commonly used, robust and cost-effective expression system for largescale production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is genetically well characterized and is easy to handle and manipulate genetically. Its faster growth rate, inexpensive culture media, high expression levels and easy scale-up process provide major advantages for large-scale production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies [11]. E. coli was successfully used to manufacture recombinant human insulin in 1982 for treating diabetes patients. It is important to note that insulin is a heterodimer and entails oxidative protein folding to attain a functionally active 3D conformation. The success accomplished with high level expression of recombinant human insulin validated the significance of E. coli expression system for large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Besides human insulin, several recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including human growth hormone, interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b, glucagon, urate oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone, have been successfully manufactured using E. coli expression system [12]. Although E. coli has been used extensively for expression of heterologous proteins, it is still not possible to determine the optimum production conditions for all the proteins. Expression conditions that are optimal for one protein may not be ideal for another protein. One of the major issues while producing heterologous proteins in E. coli is differences in codon usage between the two organisms. This difference in codon usage could cause errors in translation leading to low expression levels of recombinant proteins [13]. The other parameters that can affect the protein expression are choice of promoters, growth conditions and hydrophobicity of proteins.",

Bora, Mohamed Ahmed\n## Abstract\nPlasmids are important vectors for the transfer of genetic material among microbes. The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.\n## E. coli as an expression system for production of recombinant proteins\nEscherichia coli is a very commonly used, robust and cost-effective expression system for largescale production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is genetically well characterized and is easy to handle and manipulate genetically. Its faster growth rate, inexpensive culture media, high expression levels and easy scale-up process provide major advantages for large-scale production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies [11]. E. coli was successfully used to manufacture recombinant human insulin in 1982 for treating diabetes patients. It is important to note that insulin is a heterodimer and entails oxidative protein folding to attain a functionally active 3D conformation. The success accomplished with high level expression of recombinant human insulin validated the significance of E. coli expression system for large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Besides human insulin, several recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including human growth hormone, interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b, glucagon, urate oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone, have been successfully manufactured using E. coli expression system [12]. Although E. coli has been used extensively for expression of heterologous proteins, it is still not possible to determine the optimum production conditions for all the proteins. Expression conditions that are optimal for one protein may not be ideal for another protein. One of the major issues while producing heterologous proteins in E. coli is differences in codon usage between the two organisms. This difference in codon usage could cause errors in translation leading to low expression levels of recombinant proteins [13]. The other parameters that can affect the protein expression are choice of promoters, growth conditions and hydrophobicity of proteins.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, the effects of different nutrient media on the development of Escherichia coli biofilms and the production of a heterologous protein were examined. E. coli JM109(DE3) cells transformed with pFM23 plasmid carrying the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression were used. Cells were grown in two different culture media, Lysogenic Broth (LB) and M9ZB, in a flow cell system for 10 days. Epifluorescence microscopy, fluorimetry, and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method based on hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) were used to assess bacterial growth, plasmid copy number (PCN), and eGFP production in both planktonic and biofilm cells. The results showed that biofilm development was favored in M9ZB medium when compared with LB. However, the number of eGFP-expressing cells was higher in LB for both planktonic and sessile states (two-fold and seven-fold, respectively). In addition, the PCN in biofilm cells was slightly higher when using LB medium (on average, 29 plasmids per cell versus 20 plasmids per cell in M9ZB), and higher plasmid stability was observed in biofilms formed in LB compared to their planktonic counterparts. Hence, E. coli biofilms grown in LB enhanced both plasmid stability and capacity to produce the model heterologous protein when compared to M9ZB.",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli has been one of the most used organisms for heterologous protein production due to its inexpensive and fast high-cell density cultivation, well-known genetics, and large number of cloning vectors [1][2][3]. In addition to the host strain, factors such as the expression vector, cultivation conditions (medium composition, temperature, pH, and induction conditions), and purification strategies are essential for the successful production of heterologous proteins [4]. \n\nE. coli plasmids have been the preferred expression vectors because of the high gene dosage that can be attained and the capability to control the levels of gene expression through inducible promoters [5]. Although a high plasmid copy number (PCN) may ensure a high gene dosage, this does not always mean a high level of target heterologous protein [5,6]. Studies in suspension cell cultures have demonstrated that high plasmid copy number imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell, which reduces the bacterial growth rate and favors plasmid instability, thereby decreasing the overall protein yield [7,8]. \n\nThe use of biofilm cells in recombinant protein production has been scarcely studied, but some promising results have been obtained by our research group in the last few years [6,[9][10][11]. The biological organization of biofilms provides them with many advantages over cells grown in suspension cell cultures, including high cell density, protection against hostile conditions, and operation stability, particularly when biofilms are used in biotechnological processes for the production of value-added compounds [12]. In addition, the presence of plasmids has been shown to stimulate biofilm formation and lead to a higher production of recombinant proteins compared to planktonic cells [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Our group has demonstrated that cells expressing eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) formed more biofilm than non-expressing cells [10]. Moreover, E. coli biofilms were able to produce eGFP at a much higher level (30-fold) than their planktonic counterparts [10].",

Gomes, G. Monteiro, F. Mergulh\u00e3o\n## Abstract\nIn the present study, the effects of different nutrient media on the development of Escherichia coli biofilms and the production of a heterologous protein were examined. E. coli JM109(DE3) cells transformed with pFM23 plasmid carrying the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression were used. Cells were grown in two different culture media, Lysogenic Broth (LB) and M9ZB, in a flow cell system for 10 days. Epifluorescence microscopy, fluorimetry, and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method based on hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) were used to assess bacterial growth, plasmid copy number (PCN), and eGFP production in both planktonic and biofilm cells. The results showed that biofilm development was favored in M9ZB medium when compared with LB. However, the number of eGFP-expressing cells was higher in LB for both planktonic and sessile states (two-fold and seven-fold, respectively). In addition, the PCN in biofilm cells was slightly higher when using LB medium (on average, 29 plasmids per cell versus 20 plasmids per cell in M9ZB), and higher plasmid stability was observed in biofilms formed in LB compared to their planktonic counterparts. Hence, E. coli biofilms grown in LB enhanced both plasmid stability and capacity to produce the model heterologous protein when compared to M9ZB.\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli has been one of the most used organisms for heterologous protein production due to its inexpensive and fast high-cell density cultivation, well-known genetics, and large number of cloning vectors [1][2][3]. In addition to the host strain, factors such as the expression vector, cultivation conditions (medium composition, temperature, pH, and induction conditions), and purification strategies are essential for the successful production of heterologous proteins [4]. \n\nE. coli plasmids have been the preferred expression vectors because of the high gene dosage that can be attained and the capability to control the levels of gene expression through inducible promoters [5]. Although a high plasmid copy number (PCN) may ensure a high gene dosage, this does not always mean a high level of target heterologous protein [5,6]. Studies in suspension cell cultures have demonstrated that high plasmid copy number imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell, which reduces the bacterial growth rate and favors plasmid instability, thereby decreasing the overall protein yield [7,8]. \n\nThe use of biofilm cells in recombinant protein production has been scarcely studied, but some promising results have been obtained by our research group in the last few years [6,[9][10][11]. The biological organization of biofilms provides them with many advantages over cells grown in suspension cell cultures, including high cell density, protection against hostile conditions, and operation stability, particularly when biofilms are used in biotechnological processes for the production of value-added compounds [12]. In addition, the presence of plasmids has been shown to stimulate biofilm formation and lead to a higher production of recombinant proteins compared to planktonic cells [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Our group has demonstrated that cells expressing eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) formed more biofilm than non-expressing cells [10]. Moreover, E. coli biofilms were able to produce eGFP at a much higher level (30-fold) than their planktonic counterparts [10].",

In this work, a flow cell system was used to compare the production of a model recombinant protein (enhanced green fluorescent protein, eGFP) between planktonic and biofilm cells. The fluorometric analysis revealed that when the system was in steady state, the average specific eGFP production from Escherichia coli biofilm cells was 10-fold higher than in planktonic cells. Additionally, epifluorescence microscopy was used to determine the percentage of eGFP-expressing cells in both planktonic and biofilm populations. In steady state, the percentage of planktonic-expressing cells oscillated around 5%, whereas for biofilms eGFP-expressing cells represented on average 21% of the total cell population. Therefore, the combination of fluorometric and microscopy data allowed us to conclude that E. coli biofilm cells can have a higher recombinant protein production capacity when compared to their planktonic counterparts.",

                    "text": "Recombinant proteins are currently used in different biotechnological industries and are produced in large amounts in bioreactors [1]. An important step in recombinant protein production is to choose the ideal expression system and factors like protein quality, functionality, production speed, and yield should be considered [2]. Escherichia coli has been widely used for the production of recombinant proteins due to its fast growth at high cell densities, minimal nutrient requirements, well-characterized genetics, and the availability of a large number of cloning vectors [2,3]. In the early 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first recombinant insulin produced in E. coli [4] and since then this bacterium is one of the organisms of choice for the production of several commercial recombinant proteins [5]. \n\nMost of the research on the expression of recombinant proteins has been based on planktonic bacteria grown in liquid cultures. However, the natural state for many bacteria is to live in communities of sessile cells forming biofilms [6]. Biofilms are communities of surface-attached microorganisms encased in a self-produced extracellular matrix [7]. Such biological organization provides distinct characteristics to bacteria compared to their planktonic counterparts [8]. For instance, local environmental conditions arising as a result of mass transport limitations, intercellular signaling, and other phenomena, may induce biofilm cells to modulate expression of genes differently than in suspended populations [9]. The expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is commonly accomplished by inserting the gene of interest into a multicopy plasmid [10] that imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell [11]. In planktonic cells, this added metabolic burden may decrease cellular growth rates and biomass yields [11], particularly when the plasmid vector is used for the direct production of a recombinant protein [12]. Conjugative [13][14][15][16][17] and non-conjugative plasmids [18][19][20][21] were shown to increase biofilm formation.",

Gomes, F. Mergulh\u00e3o\n## Abstract\nRecombinant protein production in bacterial cells is commonly performed using planktonic cultures. However, the natural state for many bacteria is living in communities attached to surfaces forming biofilms. In this work, a flow cell system was used to compare the production of a model recombinant protein (enhanced green fluorescent protein, eGFP) between planktonic and biofilm cells. The fluorometric analysis revealed that when the system was in steady state, the average specific eGFP production from Escherichia coli biofilm cells was 10-fold higher than in planktonic cells. Additionally, epifluorescence microscopy was used to determine the percentage of eGFP-expressing cells in both planktonic and biofilm populations. In steady state, the percentage of planktonic-expressing cells oscillated around 5%, whereas for biofilms eGFP-expressing cells represented on average 21% of the total cell population. Therefore, the combination of fluorometric and microscopy data allowed us to conclude that E. coli biofilm cells can have a higher recombinant protein production capacity when compared to their planktonic counterparts.\n## Introduction\nRecombinant proteins are currently used in different biotechnological industries and are produced in large amounts in bioreactors [1]. An important step in recombinant protein production is to choose the ideal expression system and factors like protein quality, functionality, production speed, and yield should be considered [2]. Escherichia coli has been widely used for the production of recombinant proteins due to its fast growth at high cell densities, minimal nutrient requirements, well-characterized genetics, and the availability of a large number of cloning vectors [2,3]. In the early 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first recombinant insulin produced in E. coli [4] and since then this bacterium is one of the organisms of choice for the production of several commercial recombinant proteins [5]. \n\nMost of the research on the expression of recombinant proteins has been based on planktonic bacteria grown in liquid cultures. However, the natural state for many bacteria is to live in communities of sessile cells forming biofilms [6]. Biofilms are communities of surface-attached microorganisms encased in a self-produced extracellular matrix [7]. Such biological organization provides distinct characteristics to bacteria compared to their planktonic counterparts [8]. For instance, local environmental conditions arising as a result of mass transport limitations, intercellular signaling, and other phenomena, may induce biofilm cells to modulate expression of genes differently than in suspended populations [9]. The expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is commonly accomplished by inserting the gene of interest into a multicopy plasmid [10] that imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell [11]. In planktonic cells, this added metabolic burden may decrease cellular growth rates and biomass yields [11], particularly when the plasmid vector is used for the direct production of a recombinant protein [12]. Conjugative [13][14][15][16][17] and non-conjugative plasmids [18][19][20][21] were shown to increase biofilm formation.",

                    "text": "Recombinant protein production has led to a revolution in basic research and biotechnology and biotherapeutic industries and plays a key role in the treatment of a wide range of major diseases. Currently, the majority of commercial recombinant proteins are produced using either bacterial or eukaryotic cell expression systems dependent upon the structural complexity and cell-dependent modifications required to obtain functional protein. The Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli is an attractive system for recombinant protein production at both academic and industrial scales. It is not only cheap and easy to culture in batches to high densities, but a wide range of strains, reagents, promoters, and tools have been developed to facilitate the production of functional proteins in E. coli. In addition, the application of synthetic biology strategies is now overcoming limitations commonly associated with the application of post-translational modifications and folding of complex proteins. 1 ere, we describe an innovative expression system that induces packaging of a diverse range of recombinant proteins into membrane vesicles in E. coli. We identify a simple peptide tag that results in high yields of vesicle-packaged functional proteins and allows compartmentalization of otherwise toxic, insoluble, and disulfide bond-containing proteins, as well as extracellular release of vesicles into the media for efficient downstream processing. These released protein-packed vesicles support rapid isolation from the media and also provide a micro-environment for stable, long-term storage of functional recombinant proteins. Thus, this system provides significant benefit for a wide range of applications from discovery science to applied biotechnology and medicine. \n\nMOTIVATION The ability to reprogram a cell to direct the packaging of specific molecules into discrete membrane envelopes is one of the major challenges in the fields of synthetic biology and recombinant protein today. We thus set out to develop a system to allow the export of vesicle-packaged proteins from Escherichia coli.",

Baker, Bree R. Streather, Nyasha Allen, Lin Wang, S. Botchway, Ian R. Brown, J. Hiscock, C. Lennon, Daniel P. Mulvihill\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\nRecombinant protein production has led to a revolution in basic research and biotechnology and biotherapeutic industries and plays a key role in the treatment of a wide range of major diseases. Currently, the majority of commercial recombinant proteins are produced using either bacterial or eukaryotic cell expression systems dependent upon the structural complexity and cell-dependent modifications required to obtain functional protein. The Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli is an attractive system for recombinant protein production at both academic and industrial scales. It is not only cheap and easy to culture in batches to high densities, but a wide range of strains, reagents, promoters, and tools have been developed to facilitate the production of functional proteins in E. coli. In addition, the application of synthetic biology strategies is now overcoming limitations commonly associated with the application of post-translational modifications and folding of complex proteins. 1 ere, we describe an innovative expression system that induces packaging of a diverse range of recombinant proteins into membrane vesicles in E. coli. We identify a simple peptide tag that results in high yields of vesicle-packaged functional proteins and allows compartmentalization of otherwise toxic, insoluble, and disulfide bond-containing proteins, as well as extracellular release of vesicles into the media for efficient downstream processing. These released protein-packed vesicles support rapid isolation from the media and also provide a micro-environment for stable, long-term storage of functional recombinant proteins. Thus, this system provides significant benefit for a wide range of applications from discovery science to applied biotechnology and medicine. \n\nMOTIVATION The ability to reprogram a cell to direct the packaging of specific molecules into discrete membrane envelopes is one of the major challenges in the fields of synthetic biology and recombinant protein today. We thus set out to develop a system to allow the export of vesicle-packaged proteins from Escherichia coli.",

Microbes with degrading activities toward plant cell wall polysaccharides are the most relevant source of CWDEs for industrial applications. These organisms secrete a wide array of CWDEs in amounts strictly necessary for their own sustenance, nonetheless the production of CWDEs from wild type microbes can be increased at large-scale by using optimized fermentation strategies. In the last decades, advances in genetic engineering allowed the expression of recombinant CWDEs also in lab-domesticated organisms such as E. coli, yeasts and plants, dramatically increasing the available options for the large-scale production of CWDEs. The optimization of a CWDE-producing biofactory is a hard challenge that biotechnologists tackle by testing different expression strategies and expression-hosts. Although both the yield and production costs are critical factors to produce biomolecules at industrial scale, these parameters are often disregarded in basic research. This review presents the main characteristics and industrial applications of CWDEs directed toward the cell wall of plants, bacteria, fungi and microalgae. Different biofactories for CWDE expression are compared in order to highlight strengths and weaknesses of each production system and how these aspects impact the final enzyme cost and, consequently, the economic feasibility of using CWDEs for industrial applications.\n## Microorganisms as CWDE-Producing Biofactories\nIn addition to CWDEs from wild-type bacteria, recombinant CWDEs can be produced by E. coli through high cell density fermentation. Differently from other fermentation methods, high cell density fermentation is characterized by the highest operating costs (Ferreira et al., 2018). The advantage of using E. coli as bioreactor resides in five main factors: (i) rapid growth cycle, (ii) use of cheap growth media, (iii) capability of reaching high cell density through fermentation, (iv) possibility of using strains with low proteolytic activity, and (v) a thorough knowledge of its physiology and genetics.

RMPs usually consisting of linear, immunodominant, and phylogenetically conserved epitopes, has been applied in the experimental diagnosis of various human and animal diseases, such as leishmaniasis, brucellosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, hepatitis, leptospirosis, leprosy, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and COVID-19. The synthetic genes for these epitopes are joined to code a single RMP, either with spacers or fused, with different biochemical properties. The epitopes\u2019 high density within the RMPs contributes to a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The RMPs can also sidestep the need for multiple peptide synthesis or multiple recombinant proteins, reducing costs and enhancing the standardization conditions for immunoassays. Methods such as bioinformatics and circular dichroism have been widely applied in the development of new RMPs, helping to guide their construction and better understand their structure. Several RMPs have been expressed, mainly using the Escherichia coli expression system, highlighting the importance of these cells in the biotechnological field. In fact, technological advances in this area, offering a wide range of different strains to be used, make these cells the most widely used expression platform. RMPs have been experimentally used to diagnose a broad range of illnesses in the laboratory, suggesting they could also be useful for accurate diagnoses commercially. On this point, the RMP method offers a tempting substitute for the production of promising antigens used to assemble commercial diagnostic kits.",

Galdino\n## Abstract\nRecombinant multiepitope proteins (RMPs) are a promising alternative for application in diagnostic tests and, given their wide application in the most diverse diseases, this review article aims to survey the use of these antigens for diagnosis, as well as discuss the main points surrounding these antigens. RMPs usually consisting of linear, immunodominant, and phylogenetically conserved epitopes, has been applied in the experimental diagnosis of various human and animal diseases, such as leishmaniasis, brucellosis, cysticercosis, Chagas disease, hepatitis, leptospirosis, leprosy, filariasis, schistosomiasis, dengue, and COVID-19. The synthetic genes for these epitopes are joined to code a single RMP, either with spacers or fused, with different biochemical properties. The epitopes\u2019 high density within the RMPs contributes to a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The RMPs can also sidestep the need for multiple peptide synthesis or multiple recombinant proteins, reducing costs and enhancing the standardization conditions for immunoassays. Methods such as bioinformatics and circular dichroism have been widely applied in the development of new RMPs, helping to guide their construction and better understand their structure. Several RMPs have been expressed, mainly using the Escherichia coli expression system, highlighting the importance of these cells in the biotechnological field. In fact, technological advances in this area, offering a wide range of different strains to be used, make these cells the most widely used expression platform. RMPs have been experimentally used to diagnose a broad range of illnesses in the laboratory, suggesting they could also be useful for accurate diagnoses commercially. On this point, the RMP method offers a tempting substitute for the production of promising antigens used to assemble commercial diagnostic kits.\n## Escherichia coli: the platform of choice for RMP production\nAlthough various host cells described in the literature can serve as expression systems for recombinant protein production, almost all diagnostic RMP studies to date have used E. coli as the expression system of choice  (Tables 1-5).What makes this host so well-suited for this purpose?This expression system boasts a long history and offers several well-established advantages, including ease of manipulation, low-cost culture, and rapid growth kinetics.The doubling time of 20 min facilitates the achievement of high cell density cultures, with a theoretical concentration limit of ~ 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/mL [26,130].Furthermore, E. coli stands out as the most cost-effective host, allowing for the attainment of high cellular densities with inexpensive culture media.Additionally, well-developed tools for molecular manipulations, coupled with in-depth knowledge of its biology [131], contribute to the versatility of bacterium as a protein expression host.The E. coli cultivation process involves growing the bacteria in a culture medium, with selection antibiotics, until reaching an optical density 600 (OD) 600 between 0.6 and 0.8, a mid-log phase indicative.For that, the most widely used media are Luria-Bertani, Terrific Broth, and Super Broth, based on mixtures of tryptone/ peptone and yeast extract in a saline solution, which can either be sodium chloride or sodium phosphate.To optimize growth, the bacterial culture must be kept at a temperature and rotation of 37 \u00b0C and 150-200 revolutions per minute (rpm).Upon reaching the desired absorbance, the inducer molecule must be added to the culture medium, typically the allolactose analog isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranose (IPTG), to start recombinant gene transcription.More details of this approach are well provided by Sambrook et al.

Among microorganisms, host systems that are available include bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. All have strengths and weaknesses and their choice may be subject to the protein of interest (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Adrio and Demain, 2010). For example, if eukaryotic post-translational modifications (like protein glycosylation) are needed, a prokaryotic expression system may not be suitable (Sahdev et al., 2008). In this review, we will focus specifically on Escherichia coli. Other systems are described in excellent detail in accompanying articles of this series.\n\nThe advantages of using E. coli as the host organism are well known. (i) It has unparalleled fast growth kinetics. In glucose-salts media and given the optimal environmental conditions, its doubling time is about 20 min (Sezonov et al., 2007). This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved. The theoretical density limit of an E. coli liquid culture is estimated to be about 200 g dry cell weight/l or roughly 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/ml (Lee, 1996;Shiloach and Fass, 2005). However, exponential growth in www.frontiersin.org complex media leads to densities nowhere near that number. In the simplest laboratory setup (i.e., batch cultivation of E. coli at 37 \u2022 C, using LB media), <1 \u00d7 10 10 cells/ml may be the upper limit (Sezonov et al., 2007), which is less than 0.1% of the theoretical limit. For this reason, high cell-density culture methods were",

For example, if eukaryotic post-translational modifications (like protein glycosylation) are needed, a prokaryotic expression system may not be suitable (Sahdev et al., 2008). In this review, we will focus specifically on Escherichia coli. Other systems are described in excellent detail in accompanying articles of this series.\n\nThe advantages of using E. coli as the host organism are well known. (i) It has unparalleled fast growth kinetics. In glucose-salts media and given the optimal environmental conditions, its doubling time is about 20 min (Sezonov et al., 2007). This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved. The theoretical density limit of an E. coli liquid culture is estimated to be about 200 g dry cell weight/l or roughly 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/ml (Lee, 1996;Shiloach and Fass, 2005). However, exponential growth in www.frontiersin.org complex media leads to densities nowhere near that number. In the simplest laboratory setup (i.e., batch cultivation of E. coli at 37 \u2022 C, using LB media), <1 \u00d7 10 10 cells/ml may be the upper limit (Sezonov et al., 2007), which is less than 0.1% of the theoretical limit. For this reason, high cell-density culture methods were",

Because of its ability to rapidly grow in a high-density environment in a low-cost medium, its well-defined genetic traits, and the multiplicity of cloning vectors and mutant host strains, E. coli offers an efficient and cost-effective method for the rapid and high-yield production of proteins. The use of bacterial hosts in the context of producing recombinant toxins and fusion proteins necessitates either resistance to the toxin or the capability to facilitate the accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in organelles that spatially separate the produced toxin from its molecular target, potentially preventing unwanted cytotoxic effects within the host cell. This spatial separation can enhance the overall yield of the desired product. \n\nConcerning the production of RITs in Escherichia coli, the absence of N-linked glycosylation may lead to differences in the behavior of the expressed monoclonal antibodies compared to those produced in mammalian cells. This can include changes in antibody binding strength, serum persistence, and a possible immunogenic response. In bacteria, mAb-based RITs are incorrectly folded and assembled, necessitating costly multi-step refolding processes, which frequently begin with denatured inclusion bodies. \n\nIn summary, the choice of a prokaryotic host for toxins or RIT production involves considerations related to both resistance to the toxin and the cellular localization of the POI.

Pitari, R. Ippoliti\n## Abstract\nThe production of therapeutic recombinant toxins requires careful host cell selection. Bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells are common choices, but no universal solution exists. Achieving the delicate balance in toxin production is crucial due to potential self-intoxication. Recombinant toxins from various sources find applications in antimicrobials, biotechnology, cancer drugs, and vaccines. \u201cToxin-based therapy\u201d targets diseased cells using three strategies. Targeted cancer therapy, like antibody\u2013toxin conjugates, fusion toxins, or \u201csuicide gene therapy\u201d, can selectively eliminate cancer cells, leaving healthy cells unharmed. Notable toxins from various biological sources may be used as full-length toxins, as plant (saporin) or animal (melittin) toxins, or as isolated domains that are typical of bacterial toxins, including Pseudomonas Exotoxin A (PE) and diphtheria toxin (DT). This paper outlines toxin expression methods and system advantages and disadvantages, emphasizing host cell selection\u2019s critical role.\n## Introduction\nThe commercial production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes involves the utilization of various hosts, with the most common choices being bacteria, yeasts, and mammalian cell lines. However, identifying the most suitable host cell is arguably the most critical step in the entire production process. There are no universally ideal organisms capable of safely and efficiently producing all types of proteins. Therefore, the selection of an expression system must be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the final product. \n\nEscherichia coli is used for the recombinant production of at least 30% of the therapeutic proteins currently approved and has been-due to its well-known genetics, high rate of growth, and, in many cases, high yields-considered a favored platform in the biotech sector for its expression of proteins. For E. coli systems, there is a plethora of knowledge and extensive tools, such as vectors suitable for expression, selected strains, technologies endowed with fermentation, and strategies suitable for increasing protein folding, that are ideally developed in industrial applications. Recent advances in complex protein expression, such as full-length antibodies in non-glycosylated form, the engineering of new strains, N-glycosylation in bacterial organisms, and finally, cell-free systems, suggest that complex proteins and humanized glycoproteins can be produced in E. coli and that several strains and a lot of expression vectors have been engineered, such as the BL21(DE3)-pLysS for handling toxic proteins.

Because yeast cells are recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms, they are advantageous host organisms for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing of therapeutic recombinant proteins.\n\n## \u2022\nProkaryotic hosts Among the various systems for producing heterologous proteins, E. coli, a Gramnegative bacterium, continues to be one of the most attractive hosts.

In the case of recombinant human SCOMT (hSCOMT), it has been produced via different expression systems, such as transfected mammalian cells [9], insect cells (via mammalian and baculovirus vectors) [10], plant cells (via a potyvirus) [11] and prokaryotic cells, such as Escherichia coli. E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium and is the most commonly used organism for heterologous human protein biosynthesis [12][13][14][15][16], allowing the establishment of large scale production systems due to its ability to quickly reach high cell densities in inexpensive media. \n\nFor routine protein expression, E. coli B and K strains, along with their derivatives, are the most frequently used, with BL21 being the most suitable strain for protein production due to the lack of two specific proteases (lon and ompT), thus avoiding heterologous protein degradation. One particular BL21 derivative strain, E. coli BL21 (DE3), has been used to successfully express thousands of homologous and heterologous soluble proteins to high levels [16,17], including COMT [18][19][20]. Apart from the optimization of growth conditions, to achieve high quantities of recombinant protein, a large-scale culture processes have to be applied, mostly based on fed-batch mode cultures [14,21,22]. \n\nA fed-batch culture is generally started with an inoculum growing at the maximum specific growth rate that can be sustained using the nutrients initially present in the bioreactor, followed by the imposition of a specific regime of nutrient feed until fermentation is complete [14]. These methods are based on mathematical models that describe growth patterns and the expected demand for nutrients [22]. Regarding the pattern of nutrient addition, three main types of pre-determined feeding profiles can be considered: constant, exponential and stepwise feeds [14]. Another feeding approach that can be used is based on the direct or indirect feedback control systems for the controlled addition of nutrients.",

Passarinha\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nThe best strategy to obtain considerable amounts of human proteins is by applying recombinant technology. In the case of recombinant human SCOMT (hSCOMT), it has been produced via different expression systems, such as transfected mammalian cells [9], insect cells (via mammalian and baculovirus vectors) [10], plant cells (via a potyvirus) [11] and prokaryotic cells, such as Escherichia coli. E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium and is the most commonly used organism for heterologous human protein biosynthesis [12][13][14][15][16], allowing the establishment of large scale production systems due to its ability to quickly reach high cell densities in inexpensive media. \n\nFor routine protein expression, E. coli B and K strains, along with their derivatives, are the most frequently used, with BL21 being the most suitable strain for protein production due to the lack of two specific proteases (lon and ompT), thus avoiding heterologous protein degradation. One particular BL21 derivative strain, E. coli BL21 (DE3), has been used to successfully express thousands of homologous and heterologous soluble proteins to high levels [16,17], including COMT [18][19][20]. Apart from the optimization of growth conditions, to achieve high quantities of recombinant protein, a large-scale culture processes have to be applied, mostly based on fed-batch mode cultures [14,21,22]. \n\nA fed-batch culture is generally started with an inoculum growing at the maximum specific growth rate that can be sustained using the nutrients initially present in the bioreactor, followed by the imposition of a specific regime of nutrient feed until fermentation is complete [14]. These methods are based on mathematical models that describe growth patterns and the expected demand for nutrients [22]. Regarding the pattern of nutrient addition, three main types of pre-determined feeding profiles can be considered: constant, exponential and stepwise feeds [14]. Another feeding approach that can be used is based on the direct or indirect feedback control systems for the controlled addition of nutrients.",

The recombinant DNA technology and heterologous protein expression have helped simplify the isolation of targeted polypeptides at high purity and their structure-function examinations. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the most-established heterologous host organism, has been widely used to produce proteins of commercial and fundamental research interests. Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.",

The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

Smolskaya, Y. A. Logashina, Y. Andreev\n## Abstract\nBefore utilization in biomedical diagnosis, therapeutic treatment, and biotechnology, the diverse variety of peptides and proteins must be preliminarily purified and thoroughly characterized. The recombinant DNA technology and heterologous protein expression have helped simplify the isolation of targeted polypeptides at high purity and their structure-function examinations. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the most-established heterologous host organism, has been widely used to produce proteins of commercial and fundamental research interests. Nonetheless, many peptides/proteins are still difficult to express due to their ability to slow down cell growth or disrupt cellular metabolism. Besides, special modifications are often required for proper folding and activity of targeted proteins. The cell-free (CF) or in vitro recombinant protein synthesis system enables the production of such difficult-to-obtain molecules since it is possible to adjust reaction medium and there is no need to support cellular metabolism and viability. Here, we describe E. coli-based CF systems, the optimization steps done toward the development of highly productive and cost-effective CF methodology, and the modification of an in vitro approach required for difficult-to-obtain protein production.\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli is considered as a first-choice heterologous host organism for the expression of recombinant protein. The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

A new era began in the biopharmaceutical industry with the production of insulin, the first recombinant protein, in E. coli and its use in treating diabetes. After insulin, many biopharmaceuticals produced from E. coli have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat various human diseases. Although E. coli has some disadvantages, such as lack of post\u2010translational modifications and toxicity, it is an important host with advantages such as being a well\u2010known bacterium in recombinant protein production, cheap, simple production system, and high yield. This study examined biopharmaceuticals produced and approved in E. coli under the headings of peptides, hormones, enzymes, fusion proteins, antibody fragments, vaccines, and other pharmaceuticals. The topics on which these biopharmaceuticals were approved for treating human diseases, when and by which company they were produced, and their use and development in the field are included.\n## INTRODUCTION\nEscherichia coli was discovered to potentially produce recombinant proteins robustly and cost-effectively with the introduction of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s. 1 Until then, the pancreas of pigs and cows was the source of the insulin needed to treat diabetes. 2 onetheless, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first recombinant insulin produced by E. coli in the early 1980s, starting the next phase in the treatment of diabetes and providing a pathway for the production of more recombinant pharmaceuticals. 3 This achievement showed that even though insulin is a het-erodimer that needs oxidative protein folding, it can be synthesized in E. coli. 4 Since then, improved recombinant pharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies have started to be produced using a variety of expression hosts, including E. coli, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, and mammalian cells. 5 Compared with other recombinant microorganisms, E. coli remains one of its most attractive hosts. 7][8] A general method for producing recombinant biopharmaceuticals in E. coli is presented in Figure 1. \n\nF I G U R E 1 General method for producing recombinant biopharmaceuticals in Escherichia coli. \n\nE. coli is favored for large-scale manufacturing due to its quick growth, inexpensive nutritional needs, simplicity in scaling up, and capacity to produce high-yield, highquality pharmaceuticals. 9 Nevertheless, the application of E. coli has some restrictions. The production of some complicated proteins may be limited, for instance, by the incapacity to undertake specific posttranslational modifications and limits protein maturation and disulfide bond formation. 10 It is well-recognized that proper glycosylation and folding are crucial, particularly for complex proteins such as monoclonal antibodies. 11 Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US FDA have approved several recombinant therapeutic medicines produced from E. coli for several clinical purposes. 12",

            "abstract": "Gene expression toxicity is an important biological phenomenon and a major bottleneck in biotechnology. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) is the most popular choice for recombinant protein production, and various derivatives have been evolved or engineered to facilitate improved yield and tolerance to toxic genes. However, previous efforts to evolve BL21, such as the Walker strains C41 and C43, resulted only in decreased expression strength of the T7 system. This reveals little about the mechanisms at play and constitutes only marginal progress towards a generally higher producing cell factory. Here, we restrict the solution space for BL21(DE3) to evolve tolerance and isolate a mutant strain Evo21(DE3) with a truncation in the essential RNase E. This suggests that RNA stability plays a central role in gene expression toxicity. The evolved rne truncation is similar to a mutation previously engineered into the commercially available BL21Star(DE3), which challenges the existing assumption that this strain is unsuitable for expressing toxic proteins. We isolated another dominant mutation in a presumed substrate binding site of RNase E that improves protein production further when provided as an auxiliary plasmid. This makes it easy to improve other BL21 variants and points to RNases as prime targets for cell factory optimisation. Heyde and N\u00f8rholm investigate the role of RNAse E in the toxicity mediated by overexpression of heterologous proteins in derivatives of the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli. The authors report an unexpected connection between global RNA metabolism and the efficiency of heterologous protein production in E. coli.",

Fast growth, high cell density, inexpensive culturing, availability of more than 100 pET expression vectors 2 combined with the detailed knowledge of E. coli's genetics, physiology and metabolism make it the preferred laboratory workhorse. 3 This is evident from the more than 200,000 research publications that have cited the use of the pET vectors, and that currently more than 128,000 (86% of the recombinant) structures in the Protein Data Bank and approximately half of the proteins produced worldwide for research and commercial use are produced in E. coli 2,4 . This remarkable success is despite that bacteria often show impaired growth and fitness-loss when being used for protein production 5 -a problem that is highly gene-specific, and we still lack clear guiding principles for gene and cell factory optimisation 6 . \n\nMembrane proteins (MPs) are important drug targets and serve essential roles in basic cellular mechanisms. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, 20-30% of all genes encode membrane proteins. 7 MPs are involved in fundamental mechanisms such as transport of nutrients and signal molecules, response to environmental changes, membrane stability, maintenance of the redox potential, defence and energy conversion. With natural abundances often too low to isolate sufficient material for in vitro studies, structural and biochemical investigations are limited by our ability to produce and purify MPs recombinantly in a functional state. \n\nMPs are also notoriously known for causing burden in expression systems. They need to be properly inserted into the membrane and cannot be produced in inclusion bodies. This often leads to an overload of the membrane translocation machinery and has previously been reported to severely hamper protein homoeostasis in the cytoplasm leading to the accumulation of aggregates of proteases, chaperones, and overexpressed MPs 5,8,9 . In addition, competition for the limited space of the membrane causes decreased levels of key respiratory chain complexes and upregulation of the Arc two-component system, indicating serious alterations in central metabolism 5 .",

H. Heyde, Morten H. H. N\u00f8rholm\n## Abstract\nGene expression toxicity is an important biological phenomenon and a major bottleneck in biotechnology. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) is the most popular choice for recombinant protein production, and various derivatives have been evolved or engineered to facilitate improved yield and tolerance to toxic genes. However, previous efforts to evolve BL21, such as the Walker strains C41 and C43, resulted only in decreased expression strength of the T7 system. This reveals little about the mechanisms at play and constitutes only marginal progress towards a generally higher producing cell factory. Here, we restrict the solution space for BL21(DE3) to evolve tolerance and isolate a mutant strain Evo21(DE3) with a truncation in the essential RNase E. This suggests that RNA stability plays a central role in gene expression toxicity. The evolved rne truncation is similar to a mutation previously engineered into the commercially available BL21Star(DE3), which challenges the existing assumption that this strain is unsuitable for expressing toxic proteins. We isolated another dominant mutation in a presumed substrate binding site of RNase E that improves protein production further when provided as an auxiliary plasmid. This makes it easy to improve other BL21 variants and points to RNases as prime targets for cell factory optimisation. Heyde and N\u00f8rholm investigate the role of RNAse E in the toxicity mediated by overexpression of heterologous proteins in derivatives of the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli. The authors report an unexpected connection between global RNA metabolism and the efficiency of heterologous protein production in E. coli.\n## R\necombinant production of proteins enables biochemical and structural studies, and the pET vectors hosted in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) are the most popular approach in research laboratories 1 . Fast growth, high cell density, inexpensive culturing, availability of more than 100 pET expression vectors 2 combined with the detailed knowledge of E. coli's genetics, physiology and metabolism make it the preferred laboratory workhorse. 3 This is evident from the more than 200,000 research publications that have cited the use of the pET vectors, and that currently more than 128,000 (86% of the recombinant) structures in the Protein Data Bank and approximately half of the proteins produced worldwide for research and commercial use are produced in E. coli 2,4 . This remarkable success is despite that bacteria often show impaired growth and fitness-loss when being used for protein production 5 -a problem that is highly gene-specific, and we still lack clear guiding principles for gene and cell factory optimisation 6 . \n\nMembrane proteins (MPs) are important drug targets and serve essential roles in basic cellular mechanisms. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, 20-30% of all genes encode membrane proteins. 7 MPs are involved in fundamental mechanisms such as transport of nutrients and signal molecules, response to environmental changes, membrane stability, maintenance of the redox potential, defence and energy conversion. With natural abundances often too low to isolate sufficient material for in vitro studies, structural and biochemical investigations are limited by our ability to produce and purify MPs recombinantly in a functional state. \n\nMPs are also notoriously known for causing burden in expression systems. They need to be properly inserted into the membrane and cannot be produced in inclusion bodies. This often leads to an overload of the membrane translocation machinery and has previously been reported to severely hamper protein homoeostasis in the cytoplasm leading to the accumulation of aggregates of proteases, chaperones, and overexpressed MPs 5,8,9 . In addition, competition for the limited space of the membrane causes decreased levels of key respiratory chain complexes and upregulation of the Arc two-component system, indicating serious alterations in central metabolism 5 .",

Despite the challenges, including low protein solubility and inclusion body formation, prokaryotic host systems and particularly Escherichia coli, remain the system of choice for the initial attempt of production of previously unexpressed proteins. Several different approaches have been adopted, including optimisation of growth conditions, expression in the periplasmic space of the bacterial host or co-expression of molecular chaperones, to assist correct protein folding. A very commonly employed approach is also the use of protein fusion tags that enhance protein solubility.

Until then, small amounts of proteins and enzymes had to be extracted and purified from large amounts of animal or plant tissues, or from biological fluids. However, the revolution that came along with the recombinant production of proteins, enabling large-scale production of biological macromolecules, allowed commercial success in the biopharmaceutical industry [2]. \n\nThe biochemical characterisation of proteins is of utmost significance and a prerequisite prior to their commercialisation. This process requires sufficient amounts of protein, which can be generated with the use of recombinant technology. Protein stability, three-dimensional structure in order to identify active sites, binding affinity for ligands or determination of their interaction are some of the features that are useful in protein characterisation. In addition, from a regulatory point of view, post-translational modifications, protein structure and propensity to aggregate have to be defined in the development process of biosimilars [3]. \n\nMany different host systems have been exploited for recombinant protein production, including various prokaryotic systems, yeast, insect, plant and mammalian cells [4]. Although prokaryotic systems lack the mechanisms for complex post-translational protein modification, such as glycosylation, and expression of complex protein folds involving disulphide bond formation can be challenging in these systems [5], they have certain characteristics that frequently make them the host system of choice for first-time protein production. In particular, E. coli is characterised by rapid growth at a low cost, with a cell doubling time of approximately 20 min [6]. This fast growth rate, in combination with the range of plasmids and safe, compatible strains that can be exploited, which can be flexibly tailored to the individual needs of recombinant production, makes this organism the ideal host [7].",

Paraskevopoulou, Franco H Falcone\n## Abstract\nSince the introduction of recombinant protein expression in the second half of the 1970s, the growth of the biopharmaceutical field has been rapid and protein therapeutics has come to the foreground. Biophysical and structural characterisation of recombinant proteins is the essential prerequisite for their successful development and commercialisation as therapeutics. Despite the challenges, including low protein solubility and inclusion body formation, prokaryotic host systems and particularly Escherichia coli, remain the system of choice for the initial attempt of production of previously unexpressed proteins. Several different approaches have been adopted, including optimisation of growth conditions, expression in the periplasmic space of the bacterial host or co-expression of molecular chaperones, to assist correct protein folding. A very commonly employed approach is also the use of protein fusion tags that enhance protein solubility. Here, a range of experimentally tested peptide tags, which present specific advantages compared to protein fusion tags and the concluding remarks of these experiments are reviewed. Finally, a concept to design solubility-enhancing peptide tags based on a protein\u2019s pI is suggested.\n## Introduction\nSince the first successful attempt at recombinant production of the human peptide hormone Somatostatin in Escherichia coli in 1976 [1], protein therapeutics have come a long way. Until then, small amounts of proteins and enzymes had to be extracted and purified from large amounts of animal or plant tissues, or from biological fluids. However, the revolution that came along with the recombinant production of proteins, enabling large-scale production of biological macromolecules, allowed commercial success in the biopharmaceutical industry [2]. \n\nThe biochemical characterisation of proteins is of utmost significance and a prerequisite prior to their commercialisation. This process requires sufficient amounts of protein, which can be generated with the use of recombinant technology. Protein stability, three-dimensional structure in order to identify active sites, binding affinity for ligands or determination of their interaction are some of the features that are useful in protein characterisation. In addition, from a regulatory point of view, post-translational modifications, protein structure and propensity to aggregate have to be defined in the development process of biosimilars [3]. \n\nMany different host systems have been exploited for recombinant protein production, including various prokaryotic systems, yeast, insect, plant and mammalian cells [4]. Although prokaryotic systems lack the mechanisms for complex post-translational protein modification, such as glycosylation, and expression of complex protein folds involving disulphide bond formation can be challenging in these systems [5], they have certain characteristics that frequently make them the host system of choice for first-time protein production. In particular, E. coli is characterised by rapid growth at a low cost, with a cell doubling time of approximately 20 min [6]. This fast growth rate, in combination with the range of plasmids and safe, compatible strains that can be exploited, which can be flexibly tailored to the individual needs of recombinant production, makes this organism the ideal host [7].",

Different methodologies have been developed to target those factors that might be responsible for the problem of low yield in bacterial expression system. Briefly, these methodologies can be broadly classified as (i) those dealing with optimization of bioprocessing and culture conditions and (ii) those that deal at molecular level for enhancement of protein production, such as strain engineering, increased plasmid number, codon optimization and genetic manipulations of certain genetic elements. \n\nOptimization of bioprocessing and culturing conditions include several strategies.

            "abstract": "BackgroundGlycoconjugated vaccines composed of polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to immunogenic carrier proteins have proved to belong to the most effective and safest vaccines for combating bacterial pathogens. The functional transfer of the N-glycosylation machinery from Campylobacter jejuni to the standard prokaryotic host Escherichia coli established a novel bioconjugation methodology termed bacterial glycoengineering.ResultsIn this study, we report on the production of a new recombinant glycoconjugate vaccine against Shigella flexneri 2a representing the major serotype for global outbreaks of shigellosis. We demonstrate that S. flexneri 2a O-polysaccharides can be transferred to a detoxified variant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carrier protein exotoxin A (EPA) by the C. jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase PglB, resulting in glycosylated EPA-2a. Moreover, we optimized the in vivo production of this novel vaccine by identification and quantitative analysis of critical process parameters for glycoprotein synthesis. It was found that sequential induction of oligosaccharyltransferase PglB and carrier protein EPA increased the specific productivity of EPA-2a by a factor of 1.6. Furthermore, by the addition of 10\u00a0g/L of the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine during induction, glycoconjugate vaccine yield was boosted up to 3.1-fold. The optimum concentration of Mg2+ ions for N-glycan transfer was determined to be 10\u00a0mM. Finally, optimized parameters were transferred to high cell density cultures with a 46-fold increase of overall yield of glycoconjugate compared to the one in initial shake flask production.ConclusionThe present study is the first attempt to identify stimulating parameters for improved productivity of S. flexneri 2a bioconjugates. Optimization of glycosylation efficiency will ultimately foster the transfer of lab-scale expression to a cost-effective in vivo production process for a glycoconjugate vaccine against S. flexneri 2a in E. coli. This study is an important step towards this goal and provides a starting point for further optimization studies.",

The temperature is optimized to reduce proteolytic degradation and accumulation of protein as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The concentration of inducer and time of induction for high protein yield is also optimized. These optimization conditions depend on the promoter under which the gene of interest is present and the characteristics of the target protein.ConclusionIn the past few years, many optimization conditions for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli have been studied. These conditions depend mainly upon the promoter used to produce protein and the type of protein produced.

They play crucial roles in a number of cell processes, including cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and cell cycle, and therefore their de ciency is associated with several disorders. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late1970s, proteins began to be produced in many host organisms, resulting in quicker and simpler processes relative to their natural sources [1]. With the advancements in biological therapeutics, the development of recombinant protein drugs on a wide scale is becoming increasingly essential. The optimizations of conditions for the expression of recombinant proteins have been carried out in a variety of expression systems like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, and mammalian cells [2][3][4]. Among these expression systems, the prokaryotic expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins are much preferred. E. coli was the rst host in which recombinant DNA (rDNA) protein, insulin, was produced [5]. E. coli remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins because it is inexpensive and cost-effective for mass production of recombinant proteins. E. coli has a fast growth rate with early protein expression and high protein yield, which makes it preferable over other expression systems. Because of the better understanding of E. coli mode of transcription and translation, it is easier to manipulate its genome to optimize protein expression. \n\nA large number of commercially important proteins are recombinantly produced in E. coli, including T4 DNA ligase, CD4 and viral antigens for vaccines [6][7][8]. The expression of proteins in E. coli is achieved by inserting the gene for the recombinant protein in an expression vector under the control of a constitutive or regulatable promotor. Constitutive promoters are used for the overproduction of recombinant protein by continuous production, but they impart metabolic stress on cells energy resources leading to growth inhibition and ultimately lower yield of recombinant protein [9].",

Iftikhar\n## Abstract\n\n BackgroundOptimization of conditions for the recombinant production of proteins in a prokaryotic expression system is essential as the recombinant proteins impose a metabolic burden on cell's growth leading to low protein yield and low protein expression resulting from cell death.Main textThe concentration of media components is optimized to accommodate for depleted nutrients due to foreign protein expression. The temperature is optimized to reduce proteolytic degradation and accumulation of protein as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The concentration of inducer and time of induction for high protein yield is also optimized. These optimization conditions depend on the promoter under which the gene of interest is present and the characteristics of the target protein.ConclusionIn the past few years, many optimization conditions for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli have been studied. These conditions depend mainly upon the promoter used to produce protein and the type of protein produced. Optimizing the expression parameters of protein produced in Escherichia coli ensures maximum yield of the desired protein.\n## Background\nProteins are essential components of life and constitute the majority of living organisms. They play crucial roles in a number of cell processes, including cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and cell cycle, and therefore their de ciency is associated with several disorders. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late1970s, proteins began to be produced in many host organisms, resulting in quicker and simpler processes relative to their natural sources [1]. With the advancements in biological therapeutics, the development of recombinant protein drugs on a wide scale is becoming increasingly essential. The optimizations of conditions for the expression of recombinant proteins have been carried out in a variety of expression systems like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, and mammalian cells [2][3][4]. Among these expression systems, the prokaryotic expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins are much preferred. E. coli was the rst host in which recombinant DNA (rDNA) protein, insulin, was produced [5]. E. coli remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins because it is inexpensive and cost-effective for mass production of recombinant proteins. E. coli has a fast growth rate with early protein expression and high protein yield, which makes it preferable over other expression systems. Because of the better understanding of E. coli mode of transcription and translation, it is easier to manipulate its genome to optimize protein expression. \n\nA large number of commercially important proteins are recombinantly produced in E. coli, including T4 DNA ligase, CD4 and viral antigens for vaccines [6][7][8]. The expression of proteins in E. coli is achieved by inserting the gene for the recombinant protein in an expression vector under the control of a constitutive or regulatable promotor. Constitutive promoters are used for the overproduction of recombinant protein by continuous production, but they impart metabolic stress on cells energy resources leading to growth inhibition and ultimately lower yield of recombinant protein [9].",

            "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria are attractive hosts for recombinant protein production because they are fast growing, easy to manipulate, and genetically stable in large cultures. However, the utility of these microbes would expand if they also could secrete the product at commercial scales. Secretion of biotechnologically relevant proteins into the extracellular medium increases product purity from cell culture, decreases downstream processing requirements, and reduces overall cost. Thus, researchers are devoting significant attention to engineering Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins to the extracellular medium. Secretion from these bacteria operates through highly specialized systems, which are able to translocate proteins from the cytosol to the extracellular medium in either one or two steps. Building on past successes, researchers continue to increase the secretion efficiency and titer through these systems in an effort to make them viable for industrial production. Efforts include modifying the secretion tags required for recombinant protein secretion, developing methods to screen or select rapidly for clones with higher titer or efficiency, and improving reliability and robustness of high titer secretion through genetic manipulations. An additional focus is the expression of secretion machineries from pathogenic bacteria in the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of biotechnology, Escherichia coli, to reduce handling of pathogenic strains. This review will cover recent advances toward the development of high-expressing, high-secreting Gram-negative production strains.",

In recent years, the chemical and structural diversity of protein products has expanded rapidly, with targets such as short anti-microbial peptides [5], antibody-like binding proteins for diagnostics [6], and protein biomaterials [7,8]. These vast differences in physicochemical properties call for a variety of strategies to ensure that production of heterologous proteins is robust and scalable. \n\nSecreting protein to the extracellular space increases initial purity and thus can decrease the complexity of downstream processing. Eukaryotic hosts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or HEK 293 cells secrete recombinant proteins through their native secretion machinery at high titers [9][10][11][12]. Mammalian cells, however, are slow growing, expensive to culture, have large batch to batch variations, and can be difficult to genetically engineer [10,13]. Yeasts typically are faster growing but can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation [14]. \n\nBacterial hosts offer fast growth, relative genetic simplicity, and genetic stability [15]. Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans allow protein secretion directly to the extracellular medium through the general secretory pathway, as they lack an outer membrane (OM). Secretion stress response systems and folding chaperones provide extracellular quality control. B. subtilis has a high secretion capacity-titers on the order of grams per liter have been achieved [16][17][18]. Compatibility with heterologous proteins is largely limited to enzymes, however, and extracellular proteolytic degradation is a significant product quality issue [19]. S. lividans has low extracellular protease activity while retaining a high secretion capacity.",

Leach, Han Teng Wong, D. Tullman-Ercek\n## Abstract\nGram-negative bacteria are attractive hosts for recombinant protein production because they are fast growing, easy to manipulate, and genetically stable in large cultures. However, the utility of these microbes would expand if they also could secrete the product at commercial scales. Secretion of biotechnologically relevant proteins into the extracellular medium increases product purity from cell culture, decreases downstream processing requirements, and reduces overall cost. Thus, researchers are devoting significant attention to engineering Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins to the extracellular medium. Secretion from these bacteria operates through highly specialized systems, which are able to translocate proteins from the cytosol to the extracellular medium in either one or two steps. Building on past successes, researchers continue to increase the secretion efficiency and titer through these systems in an effort to make them viable for industrial production. Efforts include modifying the secretion tags required for recombinant protein secretion, developing methods to screen or select rapidly for clones with higher titer or efficiency, and improving reliability and robustness of high titer secretion through genetic manipulations. An additional focus is the expression of secretion machineries from pathogenic bacteria in the \u201cworkhorse\u201d of biotechnology, Escherichia coli, to reduce handling of pathogenic strains. This review will cover recent advances toward the development of high-expressing, high-secreting Gram-negative production strains.\n## Background\nThe development of recombinant insulin and its production in Escherichia coli in the 1980s [1] launched an industry that comprises billion dollar markets, with products ranging from protein biologics ($91B) [2] to industrial enzymes ($4.8B) [3,4]. In recent years, the chemical and structural diversity of protein products has expanded rapidly, with targets such as short anti-microbial peptides [5], antibody-like binding proteins for diagnostics [6], and protein biomaterials [7,8]. These vast differences in physicochemical properties call for a variety of strategies to ensure that production of heterologous proteins is robust and scalable. \n\nSecreting protein to the extracellular space increases initial purity and thus can decrease the complexity of downstream processing. Eukaryotic hosts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or HEK 293 cells secrete recombinant proteins through their native secretion machinery at high titers [9][10][11][12]. Mammalian cells, however, are slow growing, expensive to culture, have large batch to batch variations, and can be difficult to genetically engineer [10,13]. Yeasts typically are faster growing but can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation [14]. \n\nBacterial hosts offer fast growth, relative genetic simplicity, and genetic stability [15]. Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans allow protein secretion directly to the extracellular medium through the general secretory pathway, as they lack an outer membrane (OM). Secretion stress response systems and folding chaperones provide extracellular quality control. B. subtilis has a high secretion capacity-titers on the order of grams per liter have been achieved [16][17][18]. Compatibility with heterologous proteins is largely limited to enzymes, however, and extracellular proteolytic degradation is a significant product quality issue [19]. S. lividans has low extracellular protease activity while retaining a high secretion capacity.",

Escherichia coli is one of the best known and most often used host organisms for economical protein production. However, upon over-expression, protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs) are often formed. Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications. Therefore interest in understanding the mechanisms of their formation as well as their properties is increasing.",

Nevertheless, choosing an optimal expression system is vital for an efficient protein production process and is often dependant on recombinant protein itself. There are many different E. coli strains and vector systems, however B strains, such as BL21, combined with pET vectors, became popular due to their efficiency in recombinant protein production [2,12]. Because of well controlled promoters, this bacterial factory enables high recombinant protein production yields (up to 50% of total cell proteins). It proved to be a very efficient system also for the production of active protein particles called non-classical IBs (ncIBs) [7,[13][14][15]. \n\nHowever, as recombinant protein production represents stress for the host cell and thus the whole cell machinery has to adapt to an over-expression of foreign protein, quality product can only be produced when the whole bioprocess is optimized [15]. \n\nTherefore in addition to the host organism, a production media should also be optimized and quality inoculum prepared for the reproducibility of the production process. Addition of some essential microelements to the basic LB media enables higher accumulation of recombinant proteins [16]. Furthermore, lowering the cultivation temperature was proven to effectively limit the in vivo aggregation of recombinant proteins [17], hence higher amounts of soluble proteins are formed [18] and the quality of the proteins is improved, including the ones trapped inside IBs [10,13,14,19,20]. Suboptimal growth temperatures slow down all the cell processes, including transcription and translation [17] thus proteins have more time to fold properly. The extended time period between synthesis and deposition, as well as rapidly exceeded solubility of target protein, results in aggregation of better folded proteins [20,21]. \n\nWhile satisfactory protein yields could be achieved in the shake flask culture, extremely high yields could only be obtained by high cell density fermentation, using finely tuned expression systems [22].",

Komel\n## Abstract\nSince recombinant proteins are widely used in industry and in research, the need for their low-cost production is increasing. Escherichia coli is one of the best known and most often used host organisms for economical protein production. However, upon over-expression, protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs) are often formed. Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications. Therefore interest in understanding the mechanisms of their formation as well as their properties is increasing.\n## E. coli and Recombinant Protein Production\nE. coli is one of the most widely used hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. Nevertheless, choosing an optimal expression system is vital for an efficient protein production process and is often dependant on recombinant protein itself. There are many different E. coli strains and vector systems, however B strains, such as BL21, combined with pET vectors, became popular due to their efficiency in recombinant protein production [2,12]. Because of well controlled promoters, this bacterial factory enables high recombinant protein production yields (up to 50% of total cell proteins). It proved to be a very efficient system also for the production of active protein particles called non-classical IBs (ncIBs) [7,[13][14][15]. \n\nHowever, as recombinant protein production represents stress for the host cell and thus the whole cell machinery has to adapt to an over-expression of foreign protein, quality product can only be produced when the whole bioprocess is optimized [15]. \n\nTherefore in addition to the host organism, a production media should also be optimized and quality inoculum prepared for the reproducibility of the production process. Addition of some essential microelements to the basic LB media enables higher accumulation of recombinant proteins [16]. Furthermore, lowering the cultivation temperature was proven to effectively limit the in vivo aggregation of recombinant proteins [17], hence higher amounts of soluble proteins are formed [18] and the quality of the proteins is improved, including the ones trapped inside IBs [10,13,14,19,20]. Suboptimal growth temperatures slow down all the cell processes, including transcription and translation [17] thus proteins have more time to fold properly. The extended time period between synthesis and deposition, as well as rapidly exceeded solubility of target protein, results in aggregation of better folded proteins [20,21]. \n\nWhile satisfactory protein yields could be achieved in the shake flask culture, extremely high yields could only be obtained by high cell density fermentation, using finely tuned expression systems [22].",

Therefore, high-throughput applications have become an increasingly frequent technique to investigate the main factors. Within this study, the effects of temperature, induction time and inducer concentration on the metabolic state and the product formation were extensively examined. Induction profiling of E. coli Tuner(DE3) pRhotHi-2-EcFbFP was performed in 48-well Flowerplates and standard 96-well plates using a robotic platform. In parallel shake flask cultivations, the respiration activity of the microorganisms was analyzed. Therefore, two online-monitoring systems were applied: the BioLector for microtiter plates and the RAMOS-device for shake flasks. The impact of different induction conditions on biomass and product formation as well as on the oxygen transfer rate was surveyed.ResultsDifferent optimal induction conditions were obtained for temperatures of 28, 30, 34, and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The best inducer concentrations were determined to be between 0.05 and 0.1\u00a0mM IPTG for all investigated temperatures. This is 10\u201320 times lower than conventional guidelines suggest. The induction time was less relevant when the correct inducer concentration was chosen. Furthermore, there was a stronger impact on growth and respiration activity at higher temperatures. This indicated a higher metabolic burden. Therefore, lower IPTG concentrations were advantageous at elevated temperatures. Very similar results were obtained in standard 96-well plates.ConclusionTwo online-monitoring systems were successfully used to investigate the optimal induction conditions for the E. coli Tuner(DE3) pRhotHi-2-EcFbFP strain (lacY deletion mutant) at four different temperatures. The experimental effort was reduced to a minimum by integrating a liquid handling robot. To reach the maximum product formation, a detailed induction analysis was necessary. Whenever the cultivation temperature was changed, the induction conditions have to be adapted. Due to the experimental options provided by the BioLector technology, it was found that the higher the cultivation temperature, the lower the inducer concentration that has to be applied.",

                    "text": "In 1982, the recombinant protein technology achieved the great breakthrough with Humulin, a recombinant human insulin expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which was the first approved biopharmaceutical [1]. Since that time, more than 400 recombinant proteins were introduced to the market [2]. E. coli is still the most popular host organism for heterologous protein production due to its well-known genetics, high growth rates on inexpensive media, and a wide range of possible expression vectors [3]. \n\nRecombinant protein production always implicates a perturbation of the host cell metabolism, which typically leads to lower biomass growth rates [4][5][6]. This stems from high maintenance requirements for the replication of inserted plasmids and from the resources needed for the transcription of target genes [7][8][9]. Particularly, plasmids with high copy numbers can overburden the cell and induce a metabolic collapse, which results in low product yields or even cell death [10][11][12]. Thus, a good balance of biomass growth and product formation associated with unavoidable cell stress has to be found to achieve high productivity. Therefore, many parameters have to be individually optimized. This involves not only the choice of vector and promoter system, but also composition of the medium, oxygen supply, cultivation temperature and induction conditions [3,10,[13][14][15][16][17]. \n\nThe reduction of cultivation temperature is one of the common approaches to prevent formation of inclusion bodies by correct folding of the molecule [18][19][20]. Unfortunately, this comes along with prolonged cultivation times. A fast approach to investigate temperature effects in microtiter plates is through temperature profiling as described by Kunze et al. [21]. \n\nOne of the most frequently used expression systems is the E. coli T7 system under control of the lac operon, present in pET and pRhot vectors. The expression of the target protein can be induced with lactose or the nondegradable analog isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [22,23].",

Forsten, Saskia Noack, J. B\u00fcchs\n## Abstract\nBackgroundEscherichia coli (E. coli) is the most abundant expression host for recombinant proteins. The production efficiency is dependent on a multitude of parameters. Therefore, high-throughput applications have become an increasingly frequent technique to investigate the main factors. Within this study, the effects of temperature, induction time and inducer concentration on the metabolic state and the product formation were extensively examined. Induction profiling of E. coli Tuner(DE3) pRhotHi-2-EcFbFP was performed in 48-well Flowerplates and standard 96-well plates using a robotic platform. In parallel shake flask cultivations, the respiration activity of the microorganisms was analyzed. Therefore, two online-monitoring systems were applied: the BioLector for microtiter plates and the RAMOS-device for shake flasks. The impact of different induction conditions on biomass and product formation as well as on the oxygen transfer rate was surveyed.ResultsDifferent optimal induction conditions were obtained for temperatures of 28, 30, 34, and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The best inducer concentrations were determined to be between 0.05 and 0.1\u00a0mM IPTG for all investigated temperatures. This is 10\u201320 times lower than conventional guidelines suggest. The induction time was less relevant when the correct inducer concentration was chosen. Furthermore, there was a stronger impact on growth and respiration activity at higher temperatures. This indicated a higher metabolic burden. Therefore, lower IPTG concentrations were advantageous at elevated temperatures. Very similar results were obtained in standard 96-well plates.ConclusionTwo online-monitoring systems were successfully used to investigate the optimal induction conditions for the E. coli Tuner(DE3) pRhotHi-2-EcFbFP strain (lacY deletion mutant) at four different temperatures. The experimental effort was reduced to a minimum by integrating a liquid handling robot. To reach the maximum product formation, a detailed induction analysis was necessary. Whenever the cultivation temperature was changed, the induction conditions have to be adapted. Due to the experimental options provided by the BioLector technology, it was found that the higher the cultivation temperature, the lower the inducer concentration that has to be applied.\n## Background\nIn 1982, the recombinant protein technology achieved the great breakthrough with Humulin, a recombinant human insulin expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which was the first approved biopharmaceutical [1]. Since that time, more than 400 recombinant proteins were introduced to the market [2]. E. coli is still the most popular host organism for heterologous protein production due to its well-known genetics, high growth rates on inexpensive media, and a wide range of possible expression vectors [3]. \n\nRecombinant protein production always implicates a perturbation of the host cell metabolism, which typically leads to lower biomass growth rates [4][5][6]. This stems from high maintenance requirements for the replication of inserted plasmids and from the resources needed for the transcription of target genes [7][8][9]. Particularly, plasmids with high copy numbers can overburden the cell and induce a metabolic collapse, which results in low product yields or even cell death [10][11][12]. Thus, a good balance of biomass growth and product formation associated with unavoidable cell stress has to be found to achieve high productivity. Therefore, many parameters have to be individually optimized. This involves not only the choice of vector and promoter system, but also composition of the medium, oxygen supply, cultivation temperature and induction conditions [3,10,[13][14][15][16][17]. \n\nThe reduction of cultivation temperature is one of the common approaches to prevent formation of inclusion bodies by correct folding of the molecule [18][19][20]. Unfortunately, this comes along with prolonged cultivation times. A fast approach to investigate temperature effects in microtiter plates is through temperature profiling as described by Kunze et al. [21]. \n\nOne of the most frequently used expression systems is the E. coli T7 system under control of the lac operon, present in pET and pRhot vectors. The expression of the target protein can be induced with lactose or the nondegradable analog isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [22,23].",

The key benefits of using E. coli include its low cost, ease of use, and ability to scale production efficiently, making it the preferred host for many researchers. [14] urthermore, the flexibility of E. coli in accommodating various expression conditions allows for fine-tuning protein production to optimize yield and solubility, which are critical for downstream applications. Recent studies have demonstrated that altering expression parameters, such as temperature, induction time, and inducer concentration, can significantly enhance production efficiency and solubility of target proteins. [15] ur comprehensive search on the database, which catalogued E. coli-expressed recombinant proteins, included entries corresponding to 17 317 unique UniProt IDs sourced from 19 799 research articles. This extensive dataset provides valuable insight into the commonly used induction conditions across a wide array of proteins. For instance, in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), we show that the most frequently used induction temperatures are 18, 20, and 16 \u00b0C, which accounted for 19.1%, 15.6%, and 13.6% of cases, respectively. The induction times are clustered predominantly around two ranges: 12-16 h (69.0%) and 3-6 h (14.3%), with isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentrations commonly set to 1 millimolar or 0.5 millimolar. Additionally, as shown in Figure 5, specific conditions are favored to maximize the expression of proteins with distinct annotations. For example, proteins associated with \"disulfide bond,\" \"protease\", and \"DNA-binding\" annotations tend to be expressed under shorter induction times (2-8 h) and higher temperatures (28-37 \u00b0C), whereas those related to the \"cytoskeleton\", \"cell cycle\", and \"nucleus\" are less commonly expressed under shorter induction times. Moreover, proteins that bind iron or whose functions are iron-dependent are more frequently expressed at 28 \u00b0C for 24 h.",

Currently, in most cases the developmental line is characterised by a screening stage which is performed under batch conditions followed by the development of the fed-batch process.

At the example of a difficult to express protein, an RNase inhibitor, it is demonstrated that screening of various vector constructs and growth conditions can be performed in a coherent line by (i) applying a vector library with promoters and ribosome binding sites of different strength and various fusion partners together with (ii) an early stage use of the fed-batch technology. It is shown that the EnBase\u00ae technology provides an easy solution for controlled cultivation conditions in the microwell scale. Additionally the high cell densities obtained provide material for various analyses from the small culture volumes. Crucial factors for a high yield of the target protein in the actual case were (i) the fusion partner, (ii) the use of of a mineral salt medium together with the fed-batch technique, and (iii) the preinduction growth rate. Finally, it is shown that the favorable conditions selected in the microwell plate and shake flask scales also work in the bioreactor.ConclusionsCultivation media and culture conditions have a major impact on the success of a screening procedure. Therefore the application of controlled cultivation conditions is pivotal. The consequent use of fed-batch conditons from the first screening phase not only shortens the developmental line by guarantying that the selected conditions are relevant for the scale up, but in our case also standard batch cultures failed to select the right clone or conditions at all.",

            "text": "After the whole-genome sequences of thousands of organisms have been well documented, overexpressing genes to get highly pure proteins for further characterization and engineering becomes an indispensable part of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. Moreover, among the 239 US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved therapeutic peptides and proteins, as well as their 380 drug variants, the majority are manufactured by recombinant protein production [1]. \n\nIn both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins usually reduces cell fitness and the growth rate of producing cells. The growth disadvantage favors faster\u2010growing non\u2010producer mutants. Therefore, continuous bioprocessing is hardly feasible in Escherichia coli due to the high escape rate. The stability of E. coli expression systems under long\u2010term production conditions and how metabolic load triggered by recombinant gene expression influences the characteristics of mutations are investigated. Iterated fed\u2010batch\u2010like microbioreactor cultivations are conducted under production conditions. The easy\u2010to\u2010produce green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a challenging antigen\u2010binding fragment (Fab) are used as model proteins, and BL21(DE3) and BL21Q strains as expression hosts. In comparative whole\u2010genome sequencing analyses, mutations that allowed cells to grow unhindered despite recombinant protein production are identified. A T7 RNA polymerase expression system is only conditionally suitable for long\u2010term cultivation under production conditions. Mutations leading to non\u2010producers occur in either the T7 RNA polymerase gene or the T7 promoter. The host RNA polymerase\u2010based BL21Q expression system remains stable in the production of GFP in long\u2010term cultivations. For the production of Fab, mutations in lacI of the BL21Q derivatives have positive effects on long\u2010term stability. The results indicate that adaptive evolution carried out with genome\u2010integrated E. coli expression systems in microtiter cultivations under industrial\u2010relevant production conditions is an efficient strain development tool for production hosts.",

Large proteins (usually more than 400 amino acids) are typically expressed in a eukaryotic system, whereas smaller ones are expressed in prokaryotic systems. Mammalian cells, fungi, or the baculovirus system are typically chosen for proteins requiring glycosylation. The least expensive, simplest, and fastest protein expression can be achieved in Escherichia coli. Nonetheless, large proteins are difficult to be synthesized with this bacterium. Moreover, E. coli is not the best system for S-Srich proteins that require post-translational modifications. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most frequently used yeast species for the production of such proteins. At a low cost, yeast systems typically generate high protein yields as well as proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, along with the extraction of signal sequences and stimulation of glycosylation. The baculovirus system can incorporate more complex post-translational protein modifications. Most commonly, mammalian cells are used for the production of recombinant mammalian glycosylated proteins. Genetically engineered animals secrete recombinant proteins in their milk, blood, or urine. Similarly, several recombinant proteins can be produced from transgenic plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe effectiveness of expressing a recombinant protein in E. coli primarily relies on the ability to prevent unfavorable interactions between newly expressed polypeptides. These interactions lead to the aggregation of intermediate folding substances instead of native protein production [6][7][8]11]. System efficiency can be improved by maintaining conditions that stabilize intermediate folding and promote mature structure formation. Various strategies can help prevent the aggregation of proteins by masking the hydrophobic patches on their external surfaces [12,13].

For example, E. coli displays rapid growth, but may form endotoxins and inclusion bodies, and is not capable of protein glycosylation. Mammalian cells are good for post-translational modification and display high yields from Chinese Hamster Ovary cell lines, but are hindered by a slow doubling time, require complex media and may be subjected to viral contamination.

Aside from having been used by humans for millennia for the production of bread and alcoholic beverages, yeasts are now used as cell factories for the production of biofuels, biocontrol agents, probiotics, flavouring agents and a host of high-value products [13] (Figure 1). Host organisms for the heterologous production of biopharmaceuticals include Escherichia coli, mammalian cells, yeasts and plants. Each host organism has inherent advantages and disadvantages (summarised in a review on recombinant protein production [12]). For example, E. coli displays rapid growth, but may form endotoxins and inclusion bodies, and is not capable of protein glycosylation. Mammalian cells are good for post-translational modification and display high yields from Chinese Hamster Ovary cell lines, but are hindered by a slow doubling time, require complex media and may be subjected to viral contamination.

            "text": "The majority of recombinant proteins is currently produced by genetic engineering, using a variety of expression systems: recombinant prokaryotic and eukaryotic strains (e.g. cell lines and yeasts), plants or transgenic organisms. These systems are readily available, safe and provide the possibility of changing the amino acid sequence of proteins in order to better adapt the final product to its function in the body. Choosing the right expression system (host and vector) is the key step in the production of biopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe features that support the use of microorganisms for the production of recombinant proteins are their diversity, metabolic potential and the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions [12]. Bacteria are the most frequently selected microorganisms, especially Escherichia coli. The use of bacteria is cost-effective due to low production costs, easy manipulation in the genome, fast growth rate and the possibility of using many molecular methods enabling to work with them at the cellular and molecular level. Bacteria are ideal for the production of low molecular weight proteins that do not require post-translational modifications [37].\n\nBacteria of the species E. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways [23,36]. About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]. Currently, the K-12 E. coli strain and its derivatives [49,75] are routinely used in production. Despite the use of E. coli strains as the system of choice, these microorganisms are",

            "text": "E. coli is one of the most widely used hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. Nevertheless, choosing an optimal expression system is vital for an efficient protein production process and is often dependant on recombinant protein itself. There are many different E. coli strains and vector systems, however B strains, such as BL21, combined with pET vectors, became popular due to their efficiency in recombinant protein production [2,12]. Because of well controlled promoters, this bacterial factory enables high recombinant protein production yields (up to 50% of total cell proteins). It proved to be a very efficient system also for the production of active protein particles called non-classical IBs (ncIBs) [7,[13][14][15]. \n\nHowever, as recombinant protein production represents stress for the host cell and thus the whole cell machinery has to adapt to an over-expression of foreign protein, quality product can only be produced when the whole bioprocess is optimized [15]. \n\nTherefore in addition to the host organism, a production media should also be optimized and quality inoculum prepared for the reproducibility of the production process. Addition of some essential microelements to the basic LB media enables higher accumulation of recombinant proteins [16]. Furthermore, lowering the cultivation temperature was proven to effectively limit the in vivo aggregation of recombinant proteins [17], hence higher amounts of soluble proteins are formed [18] and the quality of the proteins is improved, including the ones trapped inside IBs [10,13,14,19,20]. Suboptimal growth temperatures slow down all the cell processes, including transcription and translation [17] thus proteins have more time to fold properly. The extended time period between synthesis and deposition, as well as rapidly exceeded solubility of target protein, results in aggregation of better folded proteins [20,21]. \n\nWhile satisfactory protein yields could be achieved in the shake flask culture, extremely high yields could only be obtained by high cell density fermentation, using finely tuned expression systems [22].",

This opened the door for the expression of multiple diverse molecules. The first recombinant pharmaceutical product was insulin, licenced back in 1982 (Baeshen et al. 2014).\n\nToday, the main focus of the pharmaceutical market remains on the production of monoclonal antibodies, diverse hormones and growth factors, which turn out to be the majority of the pharmaceutical income (Walsh 2004, Baeshen et al. 2014, Baeshen et al. 2015.\n\nAlthough complex recombinant proteins are mainly produced in mammalian cells, a good number of proteins is still expressed in Escherichia coli (Walsh 2014, Humer et al. 2018. Recently published papers reported that the production of biopharmaceutical proteins in E. coli moved up to a number as high as 40 % (Walsh 2010, Gupta andShukla 2016). Protein production in E. coli gained importance as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments, which can be successfully expressed in E. coli, increased (Spadiut et al. 2013). E. coli is most likely the cheapest organism to cultivate, though its products are hard to purify and therefore take long durations and efforts when it comes to product purification (Berlec and Strukelj 2013). The genome of E. coli is known very well (Huang et al. 2012) and E. coli shows very fast replication rates, resulting in high cell densities (Murarka et al. 2007, Sahdev et al. 2007. Also, cultivations can be carried out on comparatively cheap media, coupled with the little risk of contamination compared to other cultivation hosts (DeLisa et al. 1999). In addition, scale-up can be straightforward, when compared to other organisms. Summing up, protein production using E. coli as a host provides a very useful alternative to mammalian cell cultivations (Baeshen et al. 2015), as e.g. yields up to 4 g/L of soluble antibody fragments have been reported already (Gupta and Shukla 2016).\n\nBesides the classical aim to produce a high",

            "text": "The commercial production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes involves the utilization of various hosts, with the most common choices being bacteria, yeasts, and mammalian cell lines. However, identifying the most suitable host cell is arguably the most critical step in the entire production process. There are no universally ideal organisms capable of safely and efficiently producing all types of proteins. Therefore, the selection of an expression system must be carefully considered based on the characteristics of the final product. \n\nEscherichia coli is used for the recombinant production of at least 30% of the therapeutic proteins currently approved and has been-due to its well-known genetics, high rate of growth, and, in many cases, high yields-considered a favored platform in the biotech sector for its expression of proteins. For E. coli systems, there is a plethora of knowledge and extensive tools, such as vectors suitable for expression, selected strains, technologies endowed with fermentation, and strategies suitable for increasing protein folding, that are ideally developed in industrial applications. Recent advances in complex protein expression, such as full-length antibodies in non-glycosylated form, the engineering of new strains, N-glycosylation in bacterial organisms, and finally, cell-free systems, suggest that complex proteins and humanized glycoproteins can be produced in E. coli and that several strains and a lot of expression vectors have been engineered, such as the BL21(DE3)-pLysS for handling toxic proteins. E. coli can grow rapidly and produce high-density cultures using quite inexpensive culture media, allowing, in many cases, for high yields of the protein of interest. \n\nEukaryotic cells can be utilized as an alternative to prokaryotic cells for the expression in those cases requiring the strict control of the folding and assembly of multi-subunit proteins and the correct formation of disulfides since they have the required molecular, genetic, and metabolic characteristics. Because yeast cells are recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms, they are advantageous host organisms for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing of therapeutic recombinant proteins.",

First, carbohydrate moieties on helminth antigens has been reported to contribute to serological cross-reactions (Yamano et al., 2009), thus an E. coli system is used because the proteins expressed do not have post translational modifications. Second, an E. coli expression system allows production of large amounts of recombinant proteins (Kathleen et al., 1996). However, synthesis of recombinant protein places substantial metabolic burden on the producing cells. In order to prevent this burden from compromising the growth, biomass production and protein production are separated by using transcription regulators. Common regulators used in E. coli include the lac, trp, araBAD and tac promoters (Makrides, 1996). The lac promoter used in this work is controlled by the use of isopropyl-\u00df-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) (Kweon et al., 2001). Recombinant protein production is normally induced in the late exponential growth phase. However, induction in the late exponential phase or early stationary phase reduces the culture viability and can lead to production of proteases that can break down the desired recombinant protein. On the other hand, early induction can unnecessarily slow the doubling time of bacterial cells (Chisti, 1998;Corchero et al., 2001). Hence it is important to optimize the type of medium, IPTG concentration and induction time, to achieve high cell density culture towards the aim of producing a high yield of the recombinant protein. \n\nGenerally the development of fermentation strategies are focused on improving the cultivation techniques, manipulating the physiology of the bacteria and the level of recombinant protein expression.. As a result, batch and fed batch fermentation techniques have been developed (Shiloach and Fass, 2005).",

It has been proposed that the ideal inducible system would completely uncouple cell growth from recombinant synthesis, which requires the host cell to remain metabolically capable of transcription and translation in a growth-arrested state. In this scenario, all metabolic fluxes would be diverted to the production of recombinant protein [22]. While this approach is yet to be demonstrated for membrane protein production in yeast cells, soluble chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was produced to more than 40% of total cell protein in E. coli [23] suggesting that this may be a strategy worth exploring in yeast. As for bacteria, yeast growth rates often (but not always) decline dramatically upon induction of yeast cultures, in part achieving this state.\n\n3. Bacterial expression systems for membrane protein production: P T7 -based expression protocols 3.1. Optimization of culture growth conditions for improved membrane protein production\n\nWe have previously examined the importance of optimizing growth conditions for improved membrane protein production in bacterial host cells [24,25] and have published an analysis of the T7RNAP-based expression system [8]. Here we combine these insights with our updated analysis of the PDB. For simplicity, we refer only to the T7RNAPbased expression system in this section, but the principles of most of our advice can be applied more widely to other microbial expression hosts.\n\nAn important, but simple, test that should be done prior to culturing recombinant strains is to assess whether the selected plasmid/bacterial host combination is stable over time in the medium to be used for largescale production. We suggest assessing individual cultures from five independent colonies. After overnight growth in the presence of a suitable antibiotic, 10 \u22126 ,1 0 \u22127 and 10 \u22128 dilutions should be plated on 2 * TY agar with and without antibiotic. If the same number of colonies is obtained in the absence or presence of antibiotic, then the plasmid is stable and it is appropriate to proceed to growing large-scale cultures. However, if the number of colonies is higher in the absence of antibiotic, the expression plasmid is unstable (even prior to inducing expression of the target gene)",

            "text": "Another effective factor in the expression of recombinant proteins is the conditions of bacterial cultures. Researchers use shake flasks for the optimization of growth conditions. These shake flasks do not require any special instruments (Ladner et al. 2019). However, unlike bioreactors, standard cultivation of E. coli in shake flasks is done in batches. Batch growth in flasks has several limitations such as lack of pH control, low aeration, and nutrient shortage (Weuster-Botz et al. 2001). In aerobic cultures, oxygen supply is vital. Under oxygen-restricted conditions, the metabolism of a microorganism is substantially altered, and unwanted by-products like organic acids such as acetate and ethanol may be composed (Losen et al. 2004). In E.coli, high cell density followed by the formation of acetate leads to toxicity during the culture period. Controlling oxygen levels can greatly control toxicity (Johnson et al. 2010). Acetate production and its toxicity can be solved by continuously feeding the culture with glucose and maintaining the growth rate, especially before entering the acetate production stage (Millard et al. 2021). Different types of bioreactor systems have been introduced for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in E.coli (Blunt et al. 2018;Lopes et al. 2014;Muhamad Ali et al. 2015). In one experiment, researchers used a new device (gas-vortex bioreactor) for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli and claimed their method outperformed the stirred bioreactor (Savelyeva et al. 2017). Culture conditions (such as temperature, oxygen supply, and pH) were confirmed to have a significant effect on the largescale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli (Zare et al. 2019). In one research, nerve growth factor (\u03b2-NGF) protein was heterologously produced in E. coli DE3 strain, and it was reported that the 30% dissolved oxygen and postinduction temperature of 28.5 \u00b0C were the best values to produce this protein in the bioreactor (Hajihassan et al. 2019). In another study, improved growth performance of E. coli was reported by manipulating",

            "text": "The methylotrophic yeast, P. pastoris, is a useful system for the production of genetically engineered enzymes (through heterologous gene expression) for both research and industrial purposes [18]. It is considered non-toxigenic and non-pathogenic, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, White Oak, MD, USA) has approved several products prepared with help of this organism, and these products are generally accepted as safe substances (GRAS). In addition, it is an excellent host for the synthesis of recombinant proteins and offers additional benefits ranging from rapid growth to high cell density in an inexpensive and non-complex culture medium and facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins expressed heterologically [19][20][21]. \n\nE. coli expression systems are often used to produce exogenous protein on laboratory and industrial scales owing to the low cost, speed, and simplicity of cultivation [22]. E. coli strains DH5\u03b1 and Rosetta (DE3) have been used for the cloning of genes and the expression of proteins. E. coli is one of the earliest and most commonly used hosts for heterologous protein production [23,24]. The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 1. The advantages include rapid growth, fast expression, ease of cultivation, and high product yields [25][26][27]. It is used to manufacture large quantities of commercialized proteins. This method is particularly outstanding for the functional expression of non-glycosylated proteins. E. coli genetics are better understood than that of any other microorganism [28]. Recent advances in the understanding of the processes involved in coding, translation, and protein folding in E. coli and the use of advanced genetic instruments render this bacterium more useful than ever for the production of diverse eukaryotic proteins [29][30][31][32]. Its genome can be updated rapidly and reliably with ease. The regulation of promoter elements is not complex, and the number of plasmid copies can be easily adjusted. This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control.",

            "text": "In the coming years, there will be a significant increase in demand for high quality recombinant proteins. In response, biological systems used for the production of proteins must be scalable, cost-effective, safe and flexible enough to meet market requirements. Current systems rely on ''bio-factories,'' that is, mammalian, insect, yeast, and microbial cell cultures. The majority of the recombinant proteins are currently produced in Escherichia coli or mammalian cells with a few exceptions of yeast or insect cells (Yin et al., 2007). All of these bio-factories are based on fermentation technology of suspension cells in bioreactors, which requires an enormous upfront capital investment and, thereby, severely constrains their scalability. \n\nThe use of plants as production systems for recombinant proteins has been actively investigated over the last two decades. Plants are attractive as protein factories because they can produce large volumes of products efficiently and sustainably and, under certain conditions, can have significant advantages in decreasing manufacturing costs (Hood et al., 1999;Giddings, 2001). Plant systems are far less likely to harbor microbes pathogenic to humans than mammalian cells or whole transgenic animal systems. In addition, one of the major advantages of plants is that they possess an endomembrane system and secretory pathway that are similar to mammalian cells (Vitale and Pedrazzini, 2005). Thus, proteins are generally efficiently assembled with appropriate post-translational modifications. These cost, scale, and safety advantages make plant-made pharmaceuticals very promising for both commercial pharmaceutical production and for manufacturing products destined for the developing world. \n\nThree approaches are commonly used to express heterologous proteins in plants: (1) stable transformation of the nuclear genome, (2) stable transformation of the chloroplastic genome, and (3) viral transient transformation. \n\nIn stable transformation technology, an expression cassette harboring the exogenous gene of interest is integrated into the nuclear or plastid genome of plant cells, which results in the acquired character to be stably inherited over generations. These lines can be propagated vegetatively or by seed and thus, readily scaled up for protein production.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been the pioneering host for recombinant protein production, since the original recombinant DNA procedures were developed using its genetic material and infecting bacteriophages. As a consequence, and because of the accumulated know-how on E. coli genetics and physiology and the increasing number of tools for genetic engineering adapted to this bacterium, E. coli is the preferred host when attempting the production of a new protein. Also, it is still the first choice for protein production at laboratory and industrial scales for an important number of proteins, being fast growth and simple culture procedures critical issues. When searching for an ideal system for protein production, this bacterial species is clearly far from offering, in generic terms, optimal conditions for protein production and downstream. Plasmid loss and antibiotic-based maintenance, undesired chemical inducers of gene expression, plasmid/ protein-mediated metabolic burden and stress responses, lack of post-translational modifications (including the inability to form disulphide bonds), none or poor secretion, protein aggregation and proteolytic digestion, endotoxin contamination and complex downstream are among the main obstacles encountered during protein production in E. coli. In the pharmaceutical scenario, proper protein glycosylation is often requested and simplest purification procedures become highly desirable when pursuing cost-effective bioproduction. In this context, the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisae, diverse mammalian cell lines, insect cells and whole plant and animals (as transgenic systems) are being incorporated to the protein production scenario [1], and many of these products have been already approved for use as protein drugs [2]. Other (less conventional) yeast species and a more limited number of species of filamentous fungi [3], molds [4], moss [5], algae [6] and protozoa [7] are also under development as potential suppliers of recombinant proteins. The engineering of such systems could represent a promising way to the cost effective production of high quality protein versions that biotechnology and biomedical industries are steadily demanding. The potential and versatility of these platforms as protein producers or in general, as cell factories for added value products such as chemicals, amino acids or vitamins has been stressed in recent experimental reports or reviews [8][9]",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are foreign proteins produced in various expression systems. They are mainly used as pharmaceuticals for diagnostics, for the vaccination of humans or animals, and as drugs or monoclonal antibodies [1]. The ever-growing demand for recombinant proteins stimulates the development of various expression systems for the production of these proteins that meet the existing stringent standards. Today, recombinant proteins are mainly produced in traditional prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems such as Escherichia coli, several yeast species, and mammalian cell cultures. More than 50% of all pharmaceutical recombinant proteins are synthesized in mammalian cells [2,3]. Mammalian cells are necessary for the production of complex proteins because bacteria cannot form disulfide bonds efficiently and neither bacteria nor yeast can add human-like post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the secretory pathway [4]. Protein production in mammalian cells is expensive due to the high cost of the culture media components. Moreover, some recombinant proteins, such as immunotoxins or regulatory proteins, are toxic to mammalian cells. Production of biopharmaceuticals in plant expression systems is becoming a promising alternative to existing platforms based on mammalian and bacterial cells [2,5,6]. The cultivation of plant cells under controlled conditions of bioreactors ensures the production of high-quality protein according to GMP standards. The advantages of plant expression systems are rapid cell growth, low cost of nutrient media components, the low risk of contamination with animal pathogens, as well as the possibility of obtaining recombinant proteins with a modified human-type glycosylation profile. \n\nPlant cell cultures as a system for the production of recombinant proteins, however, have several drawbacks, the main one of which is associated with a low yield of recombinant protein, which rarely exceeds 100 \u00b5g/kg of fresh weight, despite significant efforts to optimize protein expression and stability [6]. In whole plants, the problem of low yield of the target protein can be overcome by transient expression. Transient expression systems have surpassed the challenge of rapid and high-yield expression of recombinant proteins in plants, allowing for gram-sized quantities to be attained in as little as 5 days [7,8].",

It defines the technology needed for the project, be it a variety of molecular tools, equipment, or reagents. Among microorganisms, host systems that are available include bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. All have strengths and weaknesses and their choice may be subject to the protein of interest (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Adrio and Demain, 2010). For example, if eukaryotic post-translational modifications (like protein glycosylation) are needed, a prokaryotic expression system may not be suitable (Sahdev et al., 2008). In this review, we will focus specifically on Escherichia coli. Other systems are described in excellent detail in accompanying articles of this series.\n\nThe advantages of using E. coli as the host organism are well known. (i) It has unparalleled fast growth kinetics. In glucose-salts media and given the optimal environmental conditions, its doubling time is about 20 min (Sezonov et al., 2007). This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved. The theoretical density limit of an E. coli liquid culture is estimated to be about 200 g dry cell weight/l or roughly 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/ml (Lee, 1996;Shiloach and Fass, 2005). However, exponential growth in www.frontiersin.org complex media leads to densities nowhere near that number. In the simplest laboratory setup (i.e., batch cultivation of E. coli at 37 \u2022 C, using LB media), <1 \u00d7 10 10 cells/ml may be the upper limit (Sezonov et al., 2007), which is less than 0.1% of the theoretical limit. For this reason, high cell-density culture methods were",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are currently used in different biotechnological industries and are produced in large amounts in bioreactors [1]. An important step in recombinant protein production is to choose the ideal expression system and factors like protein quality, functionality, production speed, and yield should be considered [2]. Escherichia coli has been widely used for the production of recombinant proteins due to its fast growth at high cell densities, minimal nutrient requirements, well-characterized genetics, and the availability of a large number of cloning vectors [2,3]. In the early 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first recombinant insulin produced in E. coli [4] and since then this bacterium is one of the organisms of choice for the production of several commercial recombinant proteins [5]. \n\nMost of the research on the expression of recombinant proteins has been based on planktonic bacteria grown in liquid cultures. However, the natural state for many bacteria is to live in communities of sessile cells forming biofilms [6]. Biofilms are communities of surface-attached microorganisms encased in a self-produced extracellular matrix [7]. Such biological organization provides distinct characteristics to bacteria compared to their planktonic counterparts [8]. For instance, local environmental conditions arising as a result of mass transport limitations, intercellular signaling, and other phenomena, may induce biofilm cells to modulate expression of genes differently than in suspended populations [9]. The expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is commonly accomplished by inserting the gene of interest into a multicopy plasmid [10] that imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell [11]. In planktonic cells, this added metabolic burden may decrease cellular growth rates and biomass yields [11], particularly when the plasmid vector is used for the direct production of a recombinant protein [12]. Conjugative [13][14][15][16][17] and non-conjugative plasmids [18][19][20][21] were shown to increase biofilm formation.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a preferred expression host due to its well-known biochemistry and genetics, as well as simple and straightforward genetic manipulations. Some disadvantages of this prokaryotic expression system include a lack of posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins (i.e., glycosylation, formation of disulfide bonds, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing), formation of insoluble inclusion bodies, poor secretion, codon bias, and endotoxin issues. Thus, the E. coli expression system is constantly being improved to overcome these problems [1,3,16]. Recombinant proteins have also been produced in other bacterial cell factories, e.g., Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Streptomyces spp., allowing the efficient secretion of recombinant proteins or lactic acid bacteria with the Generally Recognized as Safe status by FDA, such as Lactobacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis [1,4,17]. \n\nEukaryotic cells possess an endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which play a substantial role in posttranslational modifications and transport of proteins, and thus are widely used in the production of recombinant protein-based biopharmaceuticals. Among all first-time approved biopharmaceuticals from 2015 to July 2018, over half (53%) were monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and, consequently, mammalian cells dominated the other eukaryotic expression systems [18]. Mammalian cells, including the most commonly used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), have the ability to produce large and complex proteins with appropriate posttranslational modifications, especially glycosylation, with mediumto-high yields. However, the mammalian cell factories have some limitations, namely, the introduction of heterologous gene and selection of the clone being time-consuming, the risk of infection by viruses being high, the scale-up capacity being low, the propagation being difficult, the production time being long, and the ultimate overall costs being high [1,3].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one among the earliest and most commonly used host organism for protein expression (Terpe, 2006) due to the fast growth and expression, ease of culture and high yields (Swartz, 1996). Moreover, the genetics of E. coli are wellunderstood when compared to other organisms. Despite its great advantages, E. coli has certain drawbacks that can possibly influence the production efficiency of recombinant proteins. This is because a high cell density of this organism results in large quantities of acetate, which is toxic to cells. It is also reported through studies that this organism fails to produce very large proteins. Additionally, some issues were observed for E. coli system in terms of difficulties in producing proteins that have disulfide bonds and refolding ability. Another factor is the failure to produce modified protein due to the absence of glycosylation (Jenkins and Curling, 1994). Glycosylation affects properties such as solubility, stability functionality, immunogenicity, etc. In order to achieve glycosylation for attaining a stable and properly folded protein, a higher advantage is noticed for recombinant production in yeast, mold, insect or mammalian cells. A solution can be opting for secretion of the heterologous protein into the medium instead of intracellular inclusion bodies. This way, soluble and active proteins can be attained with a much easier downstream processing and cost reduction (Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005). Emergence of other bacterial systems can also be noticed over the years in the field of recombinant protein production. The engineering of Lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive bacterium for membrane protein expression is one such example (Chen, 2012). Additionally, they also possess advantages over E. coli in terms of being GRAS and endotoxin free (Yeh et al., 2009). Pseudomonas species such as P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, were also found as suitable alternatives to E. coli expression systems to attain higher yields of the recombinant protein. Today, several other bacterial systems are widely explored as cell factories.",

            "text": "Protein production in E. coli can be increased significantly through the use of high-cell-density culture systems, which can be classified into three groups: batch, fed batch, and continuous. These methods can achieve cell concentrations in excess of 100 g (dry cell weight)/liter and can provide cost-effective production of recombinant proteins. Detailed reviews of largescale fermentation systems have been published (338,607,614). The composition of the cell growth medium must be carefully formulated and monitored, because it may have significant metabolic effects on both the cells and protein production. For example, the translation of different mRNAs is differentially affected by temperature as well as changes in the culture medium (reference 284 and references therein). Nutrient composition and fermentation variables such as temperature, pH and other parameters can affect proteolytic activity, secretion, and production levels (24,25,153,324,338,614). Specific manipulations of the culture medium have been shown to enhance protein release into the medium. Thus, supplementation of the growth medium with glycine enhances the release of periplasmic proteins into the medium without causing significant cell lysis (10,13). Similarly, growth of cells under osmotic stress in the presence of sorbitol and glycyl betaine causes more than a 400-fold increase in the production of soluble, active protein (49). \n\nHigh-cell-density culture systems suffer from several drawbacks, including limited availability of dissolved oxygen at high cell density, carbon dioxide levels which can decrease growth rates and stimulate acetate formation, reduction in the mixing efficiency of the fermentor, and heat generation. The techniques that are used to minimize such problems have been examined in detail (338). A major challenge in the production of recombinant protein at high cell density is the accumulation of acetate, a lipophilic agent that is detrimental to cell growth (285,338,353). A number of strategies have been developed to reduce acetate formation in high-cell-density cultures, but these suffer from several drawbacks (338). This problem was recently resolved through the metabolic engineering of E. coli (11,12,479).",

The production of some complicated proteins may be limited, for instance, by the incapacity to undertake specific posttranslational modifications and limits protein maturation and disulfide bond formation. 10 It is well-recognized that proper glycosylation and folding are crucial, particularly for complex proteins such as monoclonal antibodies. 11 Currently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US FDA have approved several recombinant therapeutic medicines produced from E. coli for several clinical purposes. 12",

            "text": "Proteins play a crucial role as biomacromolecules in living organisms and are significant components of many consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, food, and feed. They are frequently used in industrial production of biofuels and chemicals [1] . However, the extraction and purification of valuable proteins from natural sources pose a challenge because of their low yields, making them unsuitable for industrial processes [2] . The use of recombinant proteins for disease treatment has become a well-established option, with therapeutic biopharmaceuticals being one of the fastest-growing multibillion-dollar industries. The vaccination industry generated approximately US $28 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach US $39 billion by 2022 [3] . Enzyme usage in various industrial sectors has grown continuously, particularly over the past two decades. These sectors include dairy product manufacturing [4] , starch transformation [5] , baking [6] , and beverage production [7] . For industrial production, microbial organisms are widely used to express recombinant proteins of medical or industrial value [8] . Bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli , are the most efficient producers because of their rapid growth and simple culture conditions. However, they cannot complete the post-transcriptional processes required for eukaryotic proteins, such as protein folding, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and removal of signal peptides [9] . In contrast, mammalian cells such as CHO cells have an effective post-translational modification process for eukaryotic proteins [10] . Nevertheless, the cost of recombinant protein production using mammalian cells is high due to their slow growth rate and complex culture conditions, limiting their application in this field [11] . In comparison, yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris offer sevhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.engmic.2023.100122 eral advantages. Yeasts have a rapid growth rate and strong robustness, making it compatible with large-scale cultivation in bioreactors [ 12 , 13 ].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli recombinant protein production systems are designed to achieve a high accumulation of soluble protein product in the bacterial cell. However, a strong and rapid protein production can lead to stressful situations for the host cell, resulting in protein misfolding in vivo, and consequent aggregation into inclusion bodies (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b;Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010). For instance, macromolecular crowding of proteins at high concentrations in the E. coli cytoplasm often impairs the correct folding of proteins, leading to the formation of folding intermediates that, when inefficiently processed by molecular chaperones, promote inclusion body formation (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b).\n\nStrategies that direct the soluble production of proteins in E. coli are, thus, envisaged, and become more attractive than protein refolding procedures from inclusion bodies.\n\nSeveral methods have been shown to prevent or decrease protein aggregation during protein production in E. coli on a trial-and-error basis, including:\n\n(i) Lower expression temperatures: bacteria cultivation at reduced temperatures is often used to reduce protein aggregation, since it slows down the rate of protein synthesis and folding kinetics, decreasing the hydrophobic interactions that are involved in protein self-aggregation (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). Low cultivation temperatures can also reduce or impair protein degradation due to a poor activity of heat shock proteases that are usually induced during protein overproduction in E. coli (Chesshyre and Hipkiss, 1989). This strategy has, however, some drawbacks as the reduction of temperature can also affect replication, transcription, and translation rates, besides decreasing the bacterial growth and protein production yields. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by the use of coldinducible promoters that maximize protein production under low temperature conditions (Mujacic et al., 1999). (ii) E. coli-engineered host strains: E. coli mutant strains are a significant advance toward the soluble production of difficult recombinant proteins. Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Ma",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) has been steadily increasing since the 1980s, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry, with white and red biotechnology accounting for most of the market [1]. Bacterial expression systems are an attractive alternative to the more expensive or slow growing yeast or mammalian cell culture systems. Escherichia coli alone accounts for the production of 30-40% of proteins approved for therapeutic use [2]. Its well-characterised genome, the existence of many commercially available strains and their relatively low price, the high protein expression rates and the ease of performing genomic modifications to ensure high quality products explain the E. coli dominance amongst other microorganisms [1,3,4]. \n\nThe switch from batch to continuous operation was also expected in, red biotechnology, to increase productivity, operational flexibility and the response to high market demands, following the trend demonstrated in the food, chemical and petrochemical industries. However, there was no such trend, and currently there are only a few continuous processes implemented using mammalian cells [3]. The use of microbial cells in continuous production modes at industrial scale remains uncommon, except for insulin production with Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]. \n\nThe most attractive characteristics of using continuous bioreactors (chemostats) are their high space-time yield, increased productivity, reduced protein production costs and lower space requirements. Moreover, in continuous bioreactors, the microorganisms' growth rate and the media composition (on which the protein production rate depends) are controlled to achieved \"balanced growth\" [6]. Thus, the optimisation of continuous cultures for RPP requires careful consideration of these two issues: the nutrient that limits growth and the microbial growth rate. \n\nContinuous cultures should theoretically obtain products of more consistent quality than fed-batch processes [7]. Whereas in batch processing, product quality and productivity might be a trade-off, continuous biomanufacturing gives favourable recombinant protein characteristics [8]. In addition, chemostats allow for direct comparison between different experimental set-ups and eliminate some of the scale-up issues common for batch and fed-batch processes [9]. Nevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol.",

They play crucial roles in a number of cell processes, including cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and cell cycle, and therefore their de ciency is associated with several disorders. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late1970s, proteins began to be produced in many host organisms, resulting in quicker and simpler processes relative to their natural sources [1]. With the advancements in biological therapeutics, the development of recombinant protein drugs on a wide scale is becoming increasingly essential. The optimizations of conditions for the expression of recombinant proteins have been carried out in a variety of expression systems like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, and mammalian cells [2][3][4]. Among these expression systems, the prokaryotic expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins are much preferred. E. coli was the rst host in which recombinant DNA (rDNA) protein, insulin, was produced [5]. E. coli remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins because it is inexpensive and cost-effective for mass production of recombinant proteins. E. coli has a fast growth rate with early protein expression and high protein yield, which makes it preferable over other expression systems. Because of the better understanding of E. coli mode of transcription and translation, it is easier to manipulate its genome to optimize protein expression. \n\nA large number of commercially important proteins are recombinantly produced in E. coli, including T4 DNA ligase, CD4 and viral antigens for vaccines [6][7][8]. The expression of proteins in E. coli is achieved by inserting the gene for the recombinant protein in an expression vector under the control of a constitutive or regulatable promotor. Constitutive promoters are used for the overproduction of recombinant protein by continuous production, but they impart metabolic stress on cells energy resources leading to growth inhibition and ultimately lower yield of recombinant protein [9].",

            "text": "E. coli is among the extensively applied host for the expression of the protein [43,44] owing to its rapid expression and growth, easy cultivation, and elevated titers [45]. Moreover, its genetics are well elucidated in comparison with other microorganisms. Notwithstanding appreciable merits, the use of E. coli is associated with certain drawbacks, which can probably affect the production efficacy of recombinant proteins. For example, a higher cell density may produce a large amount of acetate harmful to cells. It is also not capable of producing very large proteins. In addition, issues related to difficulties in protein production, disulfide bonds, and refolding ability have also been observed in the E. coli system. Failure to synthesize recombinant protein because of the lack of glycosylation is another problem [46]. The modified production in mold, insect, yeast, or mammalian cells presents higher advantages for achieving glycosylation to attain a properly folded and stable protein. Over the years, other bacterial systems are also emerged for producing recombinant proteins, like engineered Lactococcus lactis as a good cell factory for expressing membrane protein [47]. They exhibit benefits over E. coli in terms of being endotoxin-free and GRAS [48]. Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens were also considered preferred substitutes for E. coli expression systems to achieve a high titer of recombinant proteins. Laffitte et al. [18] cloned thaumatin II gene into E. coli K12, but the yield of protein was very low. A synthetic gene encoding thaumatin II was effectively expressed in E. coli [49]. Saraiva et al. [15] replicated the same system, resulting in about 40 mg of pure thaumatin that showed a comparable sweetness threshold value from the natural source.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) is an industrially important tool for the production of hundreds of licensed recombinant proteins (RPs), including IgG antibodies and antibody fragments (Walsh 2014;Sanchez-Garcia et al. 2016). Unlike their larger full-length IgG monoclonal antibody counterparts, which are commonly produced in mammalian cells, the relative simplicity of antibody fragments and their requirement for fewer post-translational modifications makes them suitable for production in bacterial hosts. The bacterium Escherichia coli is a commonly employed host for recombinant protein production (RPP) contributing to the production of one-third of FDA approved human biotherapeutics (Overton 2014;Walsh 2014). Single chain variable fragments (scFv) are an emerging class of IgG fragments comprising the antigen-binding variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) domains fused into a single polypeptide chain with a flexible linker (Nelson 2010). \n\nThe suitability of E. coli as a host for production of recombinant antibody fragments and other human biotherapeutic proteins stems, in large part from the following: (i) its physiology, metabolism and behaviour are very well understood compared to other bacterial species; (ii) it exhibits much faster growth, attains higher cell densities and also requires much cheaper growth media than mammalian hosts; and (iii) although it cannot produce RPs with 'human-like' glycosylation, it can generate disulphide bonds (Pl\u00fcckthun and Skerra 1989;Hsu et al. 2016). \n\nUnlike the cytoplasm, which is a reducing environment, the periplasm is an oxidising environment and so favours the formation of disulphide bonds (de Marco 2009); it also contains enzymes which catalyse the formation, correction and maintenance of disulphide bonds (the Dsb enzymes (Inaba 2009). The periplasm of E. coli offers additional advantages as a cellular compartment for targeting RPs in bioprocesses.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been one of the most used organisms for heterologous protein production due to its inexpensive and fast high-cell density cultivation, well-known genetics, and large number of cloning vectors [1][2][3]. In addition to the host strain, factors such as the expression vector, cultivation conditions (medium composition, temperature, pH, and induction conditions), and purification strategies are essential for the successful production of heterologous proteins [4]. \n\nE. coli plasmids have been the preferred expression vectors because of the high gene dosage that can be attained and the capability to control the levels of gene expression through inducible promoters [5]. Although a high plasmid copy number (PCN) may ensure a high gene dosage, this does not always mean a high level of target heterologous protein [5,6]. Studies in suspension cell cultures have demonstrated that high plasmid copy number imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell, which reduces the bacterial growth rate and favors plasmid instability, thereby decreasing the overall protein yield [7,8]. \n\nThe use of biofilm cells in recombinant protein production has been scarcely studied, but some promising results have been obtained by our research group in the last few years [6,[9][10][11]. The biological organization of biofilms provides them with many advantages over cells grown in suspension cell cultures, including high cell density, protection against hostile conditions, and operation stability, particularly when biofilms are used in biotechnological processes for the production of value-added compounds [12]. In addition, the presence of plasmids has been shown to stimulate biofilm formation and lead to a higher production of recombinant proteins compared to planktonic cells [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Our group has demonstrated that cells expressing eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) formed more biofilm than non-expressing cells [10]. Moreover, E. coli biofilms were able to produce eGFP at a much higher level (30-fold) than their planktonic counterparts [10].",

            "text": "Since early recombinant DNA times, bacteria (especially E. coli) have been the most widely used microorganisms for recombinant protein production due to genetic simplicity, fast growth rate, high cell density production and availability of a spectrum of genetic systems, among others. For production processes being efficient, foreign genes are expressed from plasmids and under the control of inducible promoters, what results into non physiological and unusually high transcription rates. Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109,110]. The specificity in protein aggregation makes inclusion bodies highly pure in composition and therefore enriched in the recombinant protein itself. However, also truncated versions of the recombinant product, other plasmid-encoded proteins, but also defined host cell proteins can get entrapped within bacterial inclusion bodies [111][112][113][114][115][116]. Moreover, the presence of folding assistant proteins in inclusion bodies [117-119] confirm that specific interactions lead to entrappment of cellular proteins in these aggregates. The high purity of inclusion bodies makes them a convenient source of easily extractable protein that must be refolded in vitro by denaturing procedures, a fact that has been largely exploited for biotechnology purposes",

            "text": "Recombinant protein synthesis is the process of producing proteins in prokaryotic microorganisms or eukaryotic cells using recombinant DNA technology, and it is an important branch of the emerging synthetic biology. It is because of the development of recombinant DNA technology that people can produce a large number of protein products for research or treatment. Historical experience has continuously proved that the manufacture of a key protein molecule can quickly promote the rapid development of related fields, such as recombinant human insulin and recombinant human growth factors. \n\nAt present, the biggest bottleneck of recombinant protein manufacturing technology lies in \"manufacturing\". The first difficulty is whether the target proteins can be expressed in large quantities by microorganisms or cells, and the second is how to obtain high-quality and active proteins through a series of processes and purification. Nowadays, expression systems such as E. coli, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells, transgenic plants and transgenic animals are often used to obtain recombinant proteins. Here we take E. coli as an example to introduce the expression process of the target proteins. Firstly, the target gene was determined and suitable vectors (Table 3) and competent cells (Table 4) were selected, then the target gene was linked to an empty vector to construct a recombinant expression vector, and then the recombinant vector was transformed into host cells for culture. When OD 600 reaches 0.4-0.6, an appropriate proportion of inducer was added to induce protein expression at a certain temperature, and finally the thalli were collected for purification (Figure 2). As an expression host, E. coli has become one of the best hosts for the production of recombinant proteins due to its rapid reproduction, low costs, and rapid expression of a large amount of target proteins (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to avoid the influence of lack of post-translational modification systems, inclusion body formation, frameshift mutations and endotoxin production on subsequent purification, several means such as changing host, vector and target gene sequence constantly, optimizing culture conditions, and co-expressing target proteins with molecular chaperones are adopted by researchers to increase protein solubility and expression (Gopal and Kumar, 2013).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression has revolutionized all aspects of the biological sciences. Most significantly, it has dramatically expanded the number of proteins that can be investigated both biochemically and structurally. Previously, protein production was the domain of experts, as purification from a natural source (i.e., plants, rabbits, bovine) was often difficult and time consuming. However, the availability of new commercial systems for recombinant protein expression, combined with advanced protein purification techniques, has made protein production prevalent throughout the biological and biomedical sciences. This has enabled the research community to study thousands of low abundance and novel proteins from a large variety of organisms. Notably, 31 recombinant proteins were approved for therapeutic use between 2003 and 2006, highlighting the importance of heterologous protein expression in biopharmaceutical research (Walsh, 2006). As the number of recombinantly produced proteins increases, so too does an appreciation for the difficulties and limitations inherent to this process.\n\nIn spite of the development of multiple nonbacterial recombinant expression systems over the last three decades (yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cell, cell free systems; see Table 5.24.1), Escherichia coli is still the preferred host for recombinant protein expression (Yin et al., 2007). The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale.\n\nDespite its many advantages and widespread use, there are also disadvantages to using E. coli as an expression host. In contrast to eukaryotic systems, transcription and translation are fast and tightly coupled. Since many eukaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool  Spirin, 2004;Langlais et al., 2007; for other references, see text.\n\nof partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded,",

Another problem for transgenic production arises during the development phase of the final product. The turnover from gene to production strain is much slower using animal hosts than when cells or cell-free systems. Here, mammalian systems are again slower than bacterial systems, while cell-free systems have the fastest turnover rate.",

First, the target protein encoded by expression vector in Escherichia coli poses metabolic burden under strong induction upon regulated promoters, as over-activated recombinant genes may produce aggregates of protein products, thus leading to the toxicity to the host and simultaneously the growth challenges derived from vector itself including retaining resistance gene and DNA production, which are factors to be considered in the cultivation [6]. Second, the downsides of overfeeding nutrition loom as several critical growth challenges have been elucidated in some studies [7], including its limited glucose turnover rate Fig. 1 Diagram of the proposed model for GR-GFP in E. coli BL21 (DE3). In the chemiosmotic coupling of E. coli, we hypothesized that the expression of Gloeobacter rhodopsin on the inner membrane could act as an additional source of proton gradient driven by light, thus promoting the proton motive force of ATP synthase. Also, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) was designed as a reporter gene for proper expression and folding of the fusion protein GF-GFP and its impact on transcription regulators, which deteriorates the integrity of its gene-harboring subpopulation in the fed-batch [8]. The use of rhodopsin as a strategy to address the problems focuses on providing additional energy to improve its glucose turnover rate in host and thus more bacterial precursors in compound synthesis. Previous studies of expressing rhodopsin have proved potential for improving the growth of the cell and the enhancement of product [9,10]. We hypothesized that additional energy provided by rhodopsin expression in the cell host could prevent protein aggregate [11] and promote cell growth.",

            "text": "BackgroundRecombinant proteins in Escherichia coli are expressed inside the cell. With the growing interest in continuous cultivation, secretion of product to the medium is not only a benefit, but a necessity in future bioprocessing. In this study, we present a novel E. coli production host for growth decoupled recombinant protein production that can leak up to 90% of recombinant protein to the extracellular space. We investigated the effects of the process parameters temperature and specific glucose uptake rate on physiology, productivity, lysis and leakiness. Two model proteins were used, Protein A and a VHH single-domain antibody, and performance was compared to the industrial standard strain BL21(DE3).ResultsWe show that inducible growth repression in the novel E. coli strain enGenes-X-press, the effect of the metabolic burden on host physiology can be greatly reduced compared to BL21(DE3). Furthermore, in both strains, increasing temperature and specific substrate enhanced productivity and leakiness. Using the enGenes-X-press strain, extracellular Protein A and VHH titer reached up to 349 mg/g and 19.6 mg/g, respectively, comprising between 80 and 90% of total soluble product, while keeping cell lysis to a minimum. BL21(DE3) leaked 198 mg/g and 3.9 mg/g of Protein A and VHH to the medium, accounting for only 56% and 34% of total soluble product, respectively.ConclusionsWe confined the parameter space in which outer membrane leakiness can be controlled, while maintaining cell viability. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the enGenes-X-press strain constitutes a superior host for extracellular production of recombinant protein.",

            "text": "Since the mammalian hormone somatostatin was first used to realize heterologous expression in Escherichia coli (Itakura et al., 1977), the expression of recombinant protein has developed rapidly for various applications, including industrial enzyme production (Headon and Walsh, 1994), biopharmaceuticals (Jozala et al., 2016), and vaccine production (Christodoulides et al., 2001). The production of recombinant proteins has been implemented in many different prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems, including E. coli, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, Arabidopsis, and even in mammalian cell culture lines (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Among these systems, E. coli is often preferred due to its fast growth, high cell density cultures, rich complex media, and easy transformation (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to improve the heterologous protein expression of E. coli systems, a number of protein tags have been developed, including the maltose-binding protein (MBP; Kapust and Waugh, 1999), glutathione S-transferase (GST; Smith and Johnson, 1988), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO; Marblestone et al., 2006), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA; Davis et al., 1999), thioredoxin (Trx;LaVallie et al., 1993), and ubiquitin (Bachmair et al., 1986;Varshavsky, 2005).",

[4], was an inflection point in recombinant protein expression research and many reports have followed, exploring the system for a variety of applications [5][6][7][8][9].Until this recent increase in interest, the fast growth rate of V. natriegens [10] was one of the more notable attributes of this Gram-negative bacterium that was isolated from a salt marsh [11].Reports have attributed this fast-growing phenotype to the large number of rRNA operons, and thus ribosomes [4,12,13], or a higher level of substrate uptake [14].Regardless, V. natriegens might have some advantages over E. coli in recombinant protein expression.\n\nThe recent work cites fast growth rate, metabolic diversity, and the emerging development of tools for genetic manipulation as positive factors for the use of V. natriegens [15,16].Fast growth rate was also what induced our lab to investigate the use of this system for recombinant protein production.",

Apart from fundamental research, recombinant protein production also represents a multi-billion dollar market , due to the use of proteins as biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes, e.g. anti-TNF and cancer antibodies, insulin analogs and proteases among others, constituting about 50-60% of the total market (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Huang et al., 2014).\n\nEscherichia coli is predominantly used as host for commercial production and research (Mattanovich et al., 2012), mainly because it is easy to cultivate and manipulate, due to the large number of molecular tools and genetic information available and, more importantly, due to the fact that the recombinant protein fraction in this organism can reach up to 50% of the dry biomass (Porro et al., 2011). There are, however, important drawbacks of using E. coli as a production platform for proteins, for example increased downstream processing costs due to the formation of inclusion bodies (Sorensen, 2010) and lack of correct posttranslational modifications of eukaryal proteins (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). As an alternative, yeasts including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are being increasingly used as the preferred platform for protein production. Yeasts have all the advantages of a microbial system (easy of manipulation and cultivation) and possess eukaryal posttranslational machinery (Bill, 2014). Furthermore, the recombinant proteins can be secreted to the extracellular medium, thus facilitating subsequent purification (Nielsen, 2013).\n\nHowever, one of the limitations of using yeast as a production platform is the burden that secreting proteins at higher rates may represent for cell metabolism, especially for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), since protein folding is a very crucial step of the secretory pathway: a correct folding determines if the newly synthesized",

            "text": "The field of recombinant protein production is constantly growing, providing both bulk scale enzymes for industrial processes as well as tailor-made proteins, such as antibody fragments, for medical usage. Yeasts have become a well utilized platform for recombinant protein production thanks to their ability to secrete proteins of interest (1)(2). This greatly facilitates product purification and thus helps to make a process economically competitive (3). As unicellular microorganisms they are easy to cultivate and high cell densities can be reached for industrial production processes. As eukaryotes they possess both protein folding machinery and the ability to perform post-translational modifications related to higher eukaryotes, which can be advantageous compared with prokaryotic microorganisms (1). Additionally, a large amount of research has been performed over the past decades into improving the secretion of recombinant proteins from yeast cells, engineering intracellular transport of secreted proteins as well as glycosylation patterns and protein folding. Recent studies also deal with the complex interactions between metabolism and recombinant protein production and systems biology tools allow the identification and overcoming of metabolic bottlenecks in recombinant protein production and secretion (4 -5).\n\nAlthough Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are by far the most commonly utilized yeasts for industrial production processes (6 -7), alternative host systems should also be considered. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one such alternative cell factory. Although this yeast is well known as a model organism for molecular and cell biology, its application for recombinant protein production has been demonstrated previously (8). In addition to having a well sequenced and annotated genome for which data is freely available (www.pombase.org), S. pombe is very well characterized in respect to cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, transcription and translation as well as in terms of protein folding and protein quality control (9). Post-translational modification of secreted proteins, especially glycosylation, is closely related to mammalian cells (10), making S. pombe an attractive host for recombinant mammalian protein production.

Cellular responses to induction depend on a number of interacting factors including the host/vector system and properties of the expressed protein. Therefore, the timing of induction of new recombinant proteins needs to be empirically determined for each new clone (Cserjan-Puschmann et al., 1999). The effect of induction time on the production of BmSXP recombinant antigen based on biomass production was determined, using cultures induced with the optimal concentration of 1.0 mM IPTG. \n\nFigure 3 shows that the culture density at OD600 1.5 was the optimal induction time since it gave the highest volumetric titre of recombinant antigen. The volumetric titre increased as the uninduced period of growth was increased up to OD600 1.5, upon which it maximizes out. This result is consistent with Lim and Jung (1998) who found that recombinant protein production in E. coli fermentations was proportional to the growth rate at induction as the cell metabolic capacity is at its greatest during rapid growth. Induction at the onset of stationary phase appeared to reduce the volumetric yield of BmSXP recombinant antigen. Several studies reported that induction in the late exponential growth led to higher  (Yee and Blanch, 1993;Zanette et al., 1998). Similar to the observation in this study, Yee and Blanch (1993) found that induction in late exponential  growth and the onset of the stationary phase led to 50% greater recombinant trypsin being produced.",

Nonetheless, large proteins are difficult to be synthesized with this bacterium. Moreover, E. coli is not the best system for S-S-rich proteins that require post-translational modifications. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most frequently used yeast species for the production of such proteins. At a low cost, yeast systems typically generate high protein yields as well as proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, along with the extraction of signal sequences and stimulation of glycosylation. The baculovirus system can incorporate more complex post-translational protein modifications. Most commonly, mammalian cells are used for the production of recombinant mammalian glycosylated proteins. Genetically engineered animals secrete recombinant proteins in their milk, blood, or urine. Similarly, several recombinant proteins can be produced from transgenic plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe effectiveness of expressing a recombinant protein in E. coli primarily relies on the ability to prevent unfavorable interactions between newly expressed polypeptides. These interactions lead to the aggregation of intermediate folding substances instead of native protein production [6][7][8]11]. System efficiency can be improved by maintaining conditions that stabilize intermediate folding and promote mature structure formation. Various strategies can help prevent the aggregation of proteins by masking the hydrophobic patches on their external surfaces [12,13]. Such strategies involve the introduction of chaperone molecules, incorporation of detergents, or co-expression of interacting sub-units involved in large complexes. When the conditions are designed to maintain the mono-dispersion of the folding intermediates, speeding up the folding cycle becomes essential for the production of stable native structures and prevention of the accumulation of metastable configurations that are potentially vulnerable to aggregation [14]. Foldases and isomerases may improve the folding process considerably. In this review, we focus on the solutions that are available for improving the bacterial expression of proteins that rely on the formation of disulfide bonds in their native state.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production emerged in the early 1980s, aiming at overcoming the limitations imposed by extraction of natural sources.For example, the first commercial pharmaceuticals, human insulin and growth hormone, were initially produced using the bacteria Escherichia coli as the host.Later, human insulin became the first licensed drug created using genetic engineering techniques in 1982, as recently reviewed [1].Nowadays, recombinant protein is considered a milestone for drug discovery.Its current market size can verify its relevance.A recent study done by MarketsandMarkets revealed that the so-called \"protein expression market\" was worth $1645.0 million in 2017 and expected to reach $2850.5 million by 2022 [2].Moreover, it is reported that, despite its various uses in the food, detergent, paper, chemical, and cosmeceutical industries, it is pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that hold the largest share market.Thus, drug discovery is one of the driven forces for the continuous growth of recombinant protein market.For example in 2011-2016, 62 new recombinant proteins were approved by regulatory agencies in USA [3].\n\nThe development of drug discovery requires the expression of various proteins.Moreover, academic purposes such as the establishment of crystal proteins also demand the expression of a large number of proteins.For that reason, high-throughput strategies are often pursued in various organisms, as previously described [4][5][6].Among the different hosts that are utilized for recombinant protein production, the bacteria Escherichia coli is widely known as a preferential host due to the vast availability of genetic tools, rapid growth, and simple cultivation techniques.Nevertheless, depending on the properties of the desired protein, utilization of E. coli might be laborious or not even possible.This is the case when the recombinant protein needs to be glycosylated or chemically modified after translation, or requires proteolytic processing.Therefore, generally the enzymes purified from E. coli need to pass through an in vitro process for the insertion of post-translational modifications, which adds steps during protein synthesis, resulting in an even costlier process and a reduced yield of final recombinant protein.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

            "text": "Since the first successful attempt at recombinant production of the human peptide hormone Somatostatin in Escherichia coli in 1976 [1], protein therapeutics have come a long way. Until then, small amounts of proteins and enzymes had to be extracted and purified from large amounts of animal or plant tissues, or from biological fluids. However, the revolution that came along with the recombinant production of proteins, enabling large-scale production of biological macromolecules, allowed commercial success in the biopharmaceutical industry [2]. \n\nThe biochemical characterisation of proteins is of utmost significance and a prerequisite prior to their commercialisation. This process requires sufficient amounts of protein, which can be generated with the use of recombinant technology. Protein stability, three-dimensional structure in order to identify active sites, binding affinity for ligands or determination of their interaction are some of the features that are useful in protein characterisation. In addition, from a regulatory point of view, post-translational modifications, protein structure and propensity to aggregate have to be defined in the development process of biosimilars [3]. \n\nMany different host systems have been exploited for recombinant protein production, including various prokaryotic systems, yeast, insect, plant and mammalian cells [4]. Although prokaryotic systems lack the mechanisms for complex post-translational protein modification, such as glycosylation, and expression of complex protein folds involving disulphide bond formation can be challenging in these systems [5], they have certain characteristics that frequently make them the host system of choice for first-time protein production. In particular, E. coli is characterised by rapid growth at a low cost, with a cell doubling time of approximately 20 min [6]. This fast growth rate, in combination with the range of plasmids and safe, compatible strains that can be exploited, which can be flexibly tailored to the individual needs of recombinant production, makes this organism the ideal host [7].",

            "text": "BackgroundAfter many years of intensive research, it is generally assumed that no universal expression system can exist for high-level production of a given recombinant protein. Among the different expression systems, the inducible systems are the most popular for their tight regulation. However, induction is in many cases less favorable due to the high cost and/or toxicity of inducers, incompatibilities with industrial scale-up or detrimental growth conditions. Expression systems using autoinduction (or self-induction) prove to be extremely versatile allowing growth and induction of recombinant proteins without the need to monitor cell density or add inducer. Unfortunately, almost all the actual auto inducible expression systems need endogenous or induced metabolic changes during the growth to trigger induction, both frequently linked to detrimental condition to cell growth. In this context, we use a simple modular approach for a cell density-based genetic regulation in order to assemble an autoinducible recombinant protein expression system in E. coli.ResultThe newly designed pLAI expression system places the expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli under control of the regulatory genes of the lux regulon of Vibrio fischeri's Quorum Sensing (QS) system.The pLAI system allows a tight regulation of the recombinant gene allowing a negligible basal expression and expression only at high cell density. Sequence optimization of regulative genes of QS of V. fischeri for expression in E. coli upgraded the system to high level expression. Moreover, partition of regulative genes between the plasmid and the host genome and introduction of a molecular safety lock permitted tighter control of gene expression.ConclusionCoupling gene expression to cell density using cell-to-cell communication provides a promising approach for recombinant protein production. The system allows the control of expression of the target recombinant gene independently from external inducers or drastic changes in metabolic conditions and enabling tight regulation of expression.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a very commonly used, robust and cost-effective expression system for largescale production of recombinant proteins. E. coli is genetically well characterized and is easy to handle and manipulate genetically. Its faster growth rate, inexpensive culture media, high expression levels and easy scale-up process provide major advantages for large-scale production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies [11]. E. coli was successfully used to manufacture recombinant human insulin in 1982 for treating diabetes patients. It is important to note that insulin is a heterodimer and entails oxidative protein folding to attain a functionally active 3D conformation. The success accomplished with high level expression of recombinant human insulin validated the significance of E. coli expression system for large-scale production of recombinant proteins. Besides human insulin, several recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications, including human growth hormone, interferon \u03b12a and \u03b12b, glucagon, urate oxidase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and parathyroid hormone, have been successfully manufactured using E. coli expression system [12]. Although E. coli has been used extensively for expression of heterologous proteins, it is still not possible to determine the optimum production conditions for all the proteins. Expression conditions that are optimal for one protein may not be ideal for another protein. One of the major issues while producing heterologous proteins in E. coli is differences in codon usage between the two organisms. This difference in codon usage could cause errors in translation leading to low expression levels of recombinant proteins [13]. The other parameters that can affect the protein expression are choice of promoters, growth conditions and hydrophobicity of proteins.",

Recently, new techniques aim to shift the control of protein production from humans to cells and empower the latter to regulate the production process, thus leading to increased protein quality.

            "text": "Recombinant or heterologous protein production (RPP) is an important biotechnological process, with applications that range from catalysis (e.g. washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g. antibody production), to protein production for enzymatic characterization and crystallography. Production of human proteins in bacteria dates back to the production of the 14-codon somatostatin gene in Escherichia coli in 1977 [1]. Since then, several hosts have been explored, including other prokaryote species [2], various yeast and fungal species [3], plant, insect, and mammalian cell lines [4]. As there is no universally optimal host, the choice of host is based on various parameters (protein yield, production time, etc.) on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOne of the most critical parameters, especially for proteins of therapeutic interest, is the presence of post-translational modifications. Complex proteins might harbor disulfide bonds as well as complex glycan structures (e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments) that influence the 3D structure, serum stability and the protein effector functions [5]. However, in the case of E. coli, many engineered strains and expression platforms were made available over the years [6], including strains that enable some complex posttranslational modifications [7]. These advances, together with its easy cultivation, fast growth, and well-studied physiology explain E. coli 's role as a major host for RPP, including sensitive applications such as therapeutic protein production [8].\n\nOver-expression of recombinant proteins can lead to significant stress in the host cell, which in turn limits its capacity to function as a cell factory. First, it constitutes a general metabolic burden, as it is responsible for depletion of precursor metabolites [9]. Recombinant proteins are usually produced in very high amounts (it is not unusual to comprise 30% or more of total cellular protein in the cell), which leads to a significant stress for the cell. The latter reacts by employing a heat-shock like response, which involves the induction of chaperones, foldases and proteases [10]. Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many rec",

            "text": "Escherichia coli remains at the forefront of the expression systems used for the production of many recombinant proteins [1], despite the fact that it is unable to perform some post-translational modifications like glycosylation [1] and shows limited secretion capacity [2,3]. In fact, among marketed biopharmaceuticals for antitumoral therapies, 69% are produced in E. coli against only 26% produced in mammalian cells [4]. \n\nSuccessful recombinant protein production in E. coli is a combination of many good decisions involving the choice of the most appropriate strain, expression vector, cultivation and purification strategies [5]. Plasmids are the most commonly used vectors for the expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. Their design is crucial in order to maintain an equilibrium between the transcriptional and translational machinery of the host cell so that the deleterious effects of heterologous protein production can be managed [2,5]. A plasmid contains many elements that are essential for its use as an expression vector, but some of the most important are the origin of replication and the promoter. The origin of replication controls the plasmid copy number (PCN) [1] and although it is often assumed that a high gene dosage is favorable for high level heterologous protein production, this is not always the case [5]. It has been shown that a high PCN may impose a metabolic burden that decreases the bacterial growth rate and originates plasmid instability, thus reducing the number of bacteria that are capable of high level protein synthesis [6][7][8]. \n\nInterestingly, plasmid stability is affected by biofilm formation. In a first study, Davies and Geesey [9] found that the PCN was approximately 1.5-fold higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms than in planktonic cells.",

For example, IgG expression titre in mouse hybridoma cell culture was increased by as much as 50% when the cells were grown in culture media with 33% spent media supplementation [7]. Conversely, feeding the cells with 100% spent media led to a significant decrease in growth and protein production by the mammalian cells. This decrease was attributed to the build-up of auto-inhibitory metabolites and lack of nutrients. \n\nGenetic engineering of a wide array of bacteria has been a central pillar of the development of the circular bioeconomy, enabling new product development from diverse organic waste streams including food oils, agrochemical waste and used bioplastics [10][11][12][13][14][15]. We aimed to test our hypothesis using Escherichia coli, a robust and versatile bacteriological expression host that is widely used commercially to produce recombinant proteins. The production of recombinant human insulin in E. coli for example, is a major milestone in human drug production [16,17]. E. coli has been shown to utilize breakdown metabolites such as lactate present in spent culture medias [18] and can grow successfully in spent media from the fermentation of other cell types [9]. \n\nComparative analysis of culture growth rates of an E. coli BL21 strain harbouring a recombinant mCherry-EF2 expression construct in rich microbiological media (LB) and in chemically defined spent media (CDSM) that had previously been used to culture CHO cells, either with or without supplementation, confirmed CDSM as a viable feed for bacterial fermentation. Analysis of recombinant protein production by the cultures confirmed equivalent recombinant protein titres post-purification when compared to LB.",

            "text": "Recombinant therapeutic proteins are transgenic proteins that are produced in a heterologous organism and are used to prevent or treat a human or animal disease. The first commercially available recombinant therapeutic protein was human insulin produced in Escherichia coli (Goeddel et al. 1979). Since then, as the technology has developed, other therapeutics, vaccines, and cytokines have been produced to protect people from infectious diseases and as cures for previously incurable diseases (Meyer et al. 2008). Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals produced by chemical synthesis, recombinant proteins are larger, with more complex structures. For example, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is composed of 21 atoms, whereas a monoclonal antibody used as an anticancer agent is composed of 25,000 atoms and exhibits a complex structure (Otto et al. 2014). Given this complexity, systems to produce such recombinant proteins generally use living cells, including E. coli, yeast, insect, and mammalian cells (Thomas et al. 2002).\n\nThe production system is chosen based on the type of drug being produced. Prokaryotic production systems are used to produce proteins that have simple structures and lack post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, whereas eukaryotic production systems are used to produce proteins that have complex structures (such as antibodies) and post-translational modifications (Ferrer-Miralles et al. 2009). Bacterial expression systems were the first systems utilized to produce recombinant proteins, and they remain in use because bacterial cells are easy to handle and grow rapidly (Redwan 2007). However, bacterial systems also have significant disadvantages, including the presence of endotoxin and the production of proteins lacking glycosylation. For these reasons, and because most biopharmaceuticals 1 3 require post-translational protein processing for function, eukaryotic yeast and mammalian cell expression systems have accounted for the majority of biopharmaceutical production (Butler 2003). Like bacteria, yeast cells are inexpensive to produce and grow quickly. In addition, they can produce glycosylated proteins (Gellison et al. 1992;Choi et al. 2003;Demain and Vaishnav 2009).

            "text": "The E. coli expression system has some convenient features, such as high growth rate, high achievable cell density in culture, grows on simple culture media, and high level of recombinant protein expression. In addition, different expression platforms and engineered strains are available for special purposes, for example, for fast and easy genetic transformation. E. coli has doubling time of 20 min in Luria-Bertani broth and can reach maximum cell density of up to 200 g (DCW)/L, or near to 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/mL [6,25,31,32]. Unlike E. coli, Bacillus subtilis has a GRAS status and is able to express extracellular proteins, consequently it is the most studied Grampositive bacterium. Other advantages of this expression system are its well-characterized genetics, its short fermentation time, and ability to grow in low-cost culture media, making it ideal for industrial and pharmaceutical applications. However, the often-low efficiency of genetic transformation and the lack of molecular biology tools have limited the application of the protein expression systems based on Bacillus [33,34]. Although bacterial systems offer many advantages, not all proteins can be suitably or readily expressed with them. Overall, they suffer from plasmid instability, and are markedly deficient when complex post-translational modifications are needed. Besides, some proteins can form inclusion bodies, which may require additional processing steps for refolding. As a result, this may substantially increase costs or undesirably affect yield. Furthermore, the possible accumulation of endotoxins, pyrogenic to humans or animals, is another disturbing drawback when therapeutic proteins are produced in E. coli [1,6,29]. Thereby, a continued search is required to find other suitable expression systems to increase either the quality, quantity, or stability of recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "The best strategy to obtain considerable amounts of human proteins is by applying recombinant technology. In the case of recombinant human SCOMT (hSCOMT), it has been produced via different expression systems, such as transfected mammalian cells [9], insect cells (via mammalian and baculovirus vectors) [10], plant cells (via a potyvirus) [11] and prokaryotic cells, such as Escherichia coli. E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium and is the most commonly used organism for heterologous human protein biosynthesis [12][13][14][15][16], allowing the establishment of large scale production systems due to its ability to quickly reach high cell densities in inexpensive media. \n\nFor routine protein expression, E. coli B and K strains, along with their derivatives, are the most frequently used, with BL21 being the most suitable strain for protein production due to the lack of two specific proteases (lon and ompT), thus avoiding heterologous protein degradation. One particular BL21 derivative strain, E. coli BL21 (DE3), has been used to successfully express thousands of homologous and heterologous soluble proteins to high levels [16,17], including COMT [18][19][20]. Apart from the optimization of growth conditions, to achieve high quantities of recombinant protein, a large-scale culture processes have to be applied, mostly based on fed-batch mode cultures [14,21,22]. \n\nA fed-batch culture is generally started with an inoculum growing at the maximum specific growth rate that can be sustained using the nutrients initially present in the bioreactor, followed by the imposition of a specific regime of nutrient feed until fermentation is complete [14]. These methods are based on mathematical models that describe growth patterns and the expected demand for nutrients [22]. Regarding the pattern of nutrient addition, three main types of pre-determined feeding profiles can be considered: constant, exponential and stepwise feeds [14]. Another feeding approach that can be used is based on the direct or indirect feedback control systems for the controlled addition of nutrients.",

Recently, the significance of the biofilm mode of growth in biotechnological applications received increased attention. Since biofilm reactors show many advantages over suspended cell reactors, especially in their higher biomass density and operational stability, bacterial biofilms have emerged as an interesting approach for the expression of specific proteins. Despite the potential of biofilm systems, recombinant protein production using biofilms has been scarcely investigated for the past 25 years. Our group has demonstrated that E. coli biofilms were able to produce a model recombinant protein, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), at much higher levels than their planktonic counterparts. Even without optimization of cultivation conditions, an attractive productivity was obtained, indicating that biofilm cultures can be used as an alternative form of high cell density cultivation (HCDC). E. coli remains one of the favorite hosts for recombinant protein production and it has been successfully used in metabolic engineering for the synthesis of high value products. This review presents the advantages and concerns of using biofilms for the production of recombinant proteins and summarizes the different biofilm systems which have been described for this purpose. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the four microbial hosts tested for recombinant protein production in biofilms (two bacteria and two filamentous fungi) are also discussed.",

            "text": "During the early development of recombinant DNA technologies in the 1970s, efforts were focused on producing products in bacteria; for example, Escherichia coli, was an attractive low-cost, high-yield (e.g., ~8 g per liter (Menacho-Melgar et al., 2020)) production host. Despite some issues, such as the challenge of purifying recombinant mammalian proteins from bacterial cell components (e.g., the cell wall) and the possibility of endotoxin contaminants (Singh et al., 2016), there were several successfullyproduced therapeutic proteins in E. coli in the 1980s. These including Humulin \u00ae (a recombinant form of insulin), Protropin \u00ae and Humatrope \u00ae (to treat hGH deficiency), Roferon A \u00ae (to treat hairy cell leukemia), and IntronA \u00ae (to treat genital warts and hepatitis) (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016). \n\nIn retrospect, the inability of E. coli to N-glycosylate proteins, and therefore to take advantage of the concomitant protein folding chaperone system in mammalian cells (Helenius & Aebi 2001), posed a significant challenge during early attempts to express large, difficult-to-fold mammalian proteins in E. coli that more often than not resulted in inclusion body formation. Unlike human and murine cells, which suffer from fundamental limitations for biomanufacturing (e.g., low product yield safety concerns, and high cost), a major detriment of bacterial production systems is their lack of mammalian-type glycosylation. In theory, this pitfall can be overcome, at least in part, by building N-glycosylation capabilities into E. coli used for recombinant protein production (Wayman et al., 2019). For example, the protein glycosylation pathway of Campylobacter jejuni, a pathogenic bacterium (Szymanski et al., 2002), has been transferred into laboratory strains of E. coli (Pandhal & Wright 2010;Wacker et al., 2002).",

For example, there are more than 200 approved peptide and protein pharmaceuticals in the US Food and Drug Administration list, including human insulin, serum albumin, human growth hormone, various antibodies, edible vaccines, collagen, human epidermal growth factor and blood coagulating protein (Factor VIII), among many others. \n\nOf the different recombinant proteins that are produced on a commercial scale, 39% are made in Escherichia coli, 35% in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 15% in yeasts, 10% by other mammalian systems and 1% by other bacteria and systems (Rader 2008). Microorganisms and cell cultures are robust recombinant protein synthesis production systems. They possess certain challenges, however, such as high culture development costs, high cell culture maintenance costs, cell culture variability and limitations concerning the production of large molecular weight proteins. \n\nIn principle, DNA from any source can be manipulated in any living system. Genetically engineered animals have been created that produce recombinant proteins in their tissues, milk, blood or urine (http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=q0WCjX8jUE4). By the late 1980s, it was shown that transgenic plants could be used as alternative, commercial-scale, recombinant protein production platforms, after immunoglobulins and the assembly of functional antibodies were successfully achieved at 1.3% of the total leaf protein in tobacco leaves (Hiatt et al. 1989).",

            "text": "Cells are surrounded by complex envelopes that control the exchange of metabolites, catabolites, energy and signals with the environment [1,2]. For this manifold requirements, they rely on membrane integrated proteins that differ in structure and function. Up to 30% of all genes in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes encode such membrane proteins [3] and their malfunction often causes serious diseases like diabetes or cystic fibrosis [4,5]. To gain insight into the structure and function of membrane proteins, it is crucial to purify them in sufficient amounts and in a properly folded state [6]. As they are usually not sufficiently abundant in the native cell membrane, numerous expression systems for the recombinant production of membrane proteins have been established. They differ in the host organism used, the transcriptional regulation or the post-translational modifications of the proteins [7,8]. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, studies on membrane proteins are challenging and in many cases already their production fails. \n\nEscherichia coli is the most commonly used prokaryotic host for the recombinant production of membrane protein. The organism is comprehensively characterized and can be cultivated in a cost efficient manner. Growth in rich and minimal media to high cell densities is possible over a wide range of temperatures within the course of 1 day. Escherichia coli's genome was sequenced in 1997 [9] facilitating the directed design of specialized strains for protein production [10,11]. Genetic tools to create gene deletion or insertion mutants are available and transient gene expression is enabled by the availability of a large number of vectors and promoters [12]. Taken together, E. coli is part of the most advanced prokaryotic production systems available but still membrane protein production is a bottleneck in many studies. Different Bacillus species, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Lactococcus lactis and several further species are successfully used for the commercial production of predominantly soluble proteins [7], but only L. lactis is frequently used as an alternative host for the production of membrane proteins [13]. As a Gram-positive bacterium it differs from E. coli in several aspects, e.g.",

The enzyme production rate, yield, quality and functionality are the most important factors to be considered when industrial recombinant enzymes are produced in hosts. 2 The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant enzymes depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, post-translational modifications and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of the therapeutic proteins. 3 Moreover, the cost breakdown in terms of process and design and other economic considerations is required for the selection of a particular expression system. 4 Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in Escherichia coli, Bacilli (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) and lactic acid bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus lactis), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris). [5][6][7][8][9] Bacterial expression systems remain very attractive due to their ability to grow rapidly and at high density on inexpensive substrates, their well-characterized genetics and the availability of an increasingly large number of cloning vectors and mutant host strains. 10 The advent of recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized strategies for protein production. Due to the well-characterized genome and a variety of mature tools available for genetic manipulation, E. coli is still the most common workhorse for recombinant protein production. 1,10,11 However, despite the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be efficiently expressed in this organism.\n\nDue to the multiplicity of physiological impacts arising from high-level gene expression and host strains, the overproduction goal can hardly be achieved, and therefore, the yield of rec",

            "text": "The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant proteins depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, posttranslational modifications, and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of therapeutic proteins (191,254). In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of process, design, and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect, and mammalian expression systems have been examined in detail in an excellent review by Marino (362). In addition, Datar et al. (121) have analyzed the economic issues associated with protein production in bacterial and mammalian cells. \n\nThe many advantages of Escherichia coli have ensured that it remains a valuable organism for the high-level production of recombinant proteins (177a, 197, 254, 362, 406, 426, 510). However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486).",

            "text": "Currently, mAbs are largely produced in mammalian expression systems. This technique is attractive in terms of its high expression efficiency and its ability to produce large, complex proteins. \n\nAntibody production requires a large number of cultured mammalian cells, resulting in low production rate, extremely high production costs, and technically challenging fermentation and puri\ue103cation steps. 7,8 Alternative mAbs production systems in microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) is more desirable due to its simplicity and reduced production time and costs. 9 Currently, two antigen-binding fragments (Fab)-Lucentis\u00ae and Cimzia\u00ae-are commercially available and produced in the E. coli system, indicating that E. coli may be useful for industrial scale antibody production. 10 Early attempts to produce full-length IgG in E. coli was in the form of inclusion bodies in the cytoplasmic space 11 or in the soluble form in the periplasmic space. 12,13 Drastic improvements have recently been made to engineer E. coli strains which are suitable for the expression of multi-disul\ue103de bond proteins, called SHuffle strains. 14 In 2015, Robinson et al. reported the \ue103rst soluble expression of active, full-length IgGs in the cytoplasm of SHuffle E. coli cells, an achievement that was not possible in wild-type E. coli. 15 Moreover, they showed that these cytoplasmic IgGs produced in E. coli, termed 'cyclonals' could be redirect to different target antigens by simply swapping the Fv domains while keeping the same scaffold. Genetic manipulation is also easier and more bene\ue103cial when using E. coli as a host, since many antibody engineering techniques such as gra\ue09ding alternative epitope recognition domains, humanizing, and Fc engineering can be utilized to rapidly create custom mouse, rabbit, or humanized antibodies on demand. \n\nAntibody efficacy is largely dependent upon their atomic interactions with an antigen. A longer binding time of antibody-antigen results in a higher antibody efficacy, resulting in the use of a lower drug dose. In the present study, to determine an effective humanized mAb speci\ue103c for VEGF, three gra\ue09ded antibodies (chimeric, CDR and SDR-gra\ue09ding) were designed and constructed.",

            "text": "The increasing amount of data derived from genome scale studies has forced the implementation of protein expression pipelines that support high throughput (HT) screening and testing of cloned gene products [1,2]. Typically, these pipelines combine batteries of cultivation devices eventually integrated with fluidic-handling and/or robotic apparatus for automated processes. Tubes or shake flasks have been the standard lab-scale cultivation devices for decades and have been used in industry and academia to grow a wide range of microorganisms as well as mammalian cells. They are easy to operate and can be designed for automated monitoring of cultivation parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen. However, they are unfit for HT operations as their scale-up possibilities are limited to a few dozen parallelized cultures. Thus, there has been an intense effort to design cultivation apparatus that allows growth of hundreds to thousands of cultures in parallel. This goal is typically achieved by two means: reducing the working volume of cultures to milliliter-scale or below, and using bacteria as expression hosts [3].\n\nDeep-well microtiter plates are regularly employed as easy-to-use miniaturized minifermenters. They allow working with multiples of 96 cultures simultaneously. The biomass and the amount of recombinant protein obtained by milliliter-scale cultures are satisfactory for most research purposes and allow selection of protein candidates for scale-up production and expression. Fast cultivation, easy handling and well-characterized genetics make Escherichia coli one of the most widely used hosts for the production of heterologous proteins. However, even in such a microorganism, the production of recombinant proteins at high levels and biologically active form is not guaranteed, being influenced by the physico-chemical properties of each protein and by cultivation conditions. In particular, when operating with microtiter-based systems, nutrient consumption and aeration play a major role [4]. Typically bacterial cultures are carried out in batch mode by shaking or stirring a fixed volume of rich medium [5]. Unfortunately, at high cell densities, nutrients can become limiting and lead to carbon catabolite repression, consequent growth impairment and reduced production of the desired protein.\n\nIn addition, the small specific mass transfer area of multiwell plates limits oxygen diffusion, leading to stress responses and medium acid",

In 2010, it was reported that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli, compared with those expressed in all hosts had remained constant, at roughly 60% per year during the 15 year period 1995-2009 (S\u00f8rensen, 2010). Table 1 includes the corresponding data for the other commonly used host cells; it shows that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli has remained high to date and that approximately half of these genes are eukaryotic. For all other hosts, the absolute numbers are much smaller, but it is notable that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in Pichia pastoris has steadily increased from 1995 to date, in contrast to all other host cells (Table 1). Coupled with the beginnings of a decline in usage for E. coli over the last 8 years, this could suggest that researchers are beginning to recognize the capacity of P. pastoris to produce more challenging recombinant targets. \n\nEscherichia coli stands out as the pre-eminent host cell for producing recombinant proteins in both commercial [50% of proteins; (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Mattanovich et al., 2012)] and research (>70% of proteins; Table 1) laboratories; it is quick and inexpensive to culture, making it ideal in many respects.

            "text": "The possibility to heterologously express and purify specific recombinant proteins in large amounts permits their biochemical characterisation, the development of commercial goods and their use in industrial processes. With the development of recombinant insulin and its production in Escherichia coli in the 1980s [1], a multi-billion dollar market was launched, leading to current large-scale applications that are nowadays capable of releasing products ranging from protein biologics to industrial enzymes [2]. Ideally, the practical steps that lead to recombinant protein production are pretty straightforward and include the identification of the gene of interest, its cloning into an expression vector, its transformation into the host of choice, the induction of protein synthesis and its final purification and characterisation [3]. The intrinsic complexity of biological systems, however, usually poses problems down the pipeline of bacterial heterologous protein production. Indeed, as a consequence of the induction of the production of the foreign protein, the biochemistry and physiology of the host may be dramatically altered. The numerous physiological changes that may occur often lower the amount of the target foreign protein that is produced and eventually recovered from the recombinant organism [4]. In bacteria, high levels of recombinant protein production frequently lead to an impact on host cell metabolism; this is usually detectable through growth retardation and is generally known as 'metabolic burden' [5]. This additional metabolic load on the microbial chassis has been defined as the portion of a host cell's resources-either in the form of energy, such as ATP or GTP, or raw materials, such as amino acids-that is required to maintain and express foreign DNA, as either RNA or protein, in the cell [4]. In E. coli, for example, the overexpression of an unnecessary protein results in a linear decrease in the growth rate, with the zero-growth limit occurring when the overexpressed protein occupies a mass fraction equal to 1-\u03c6 f ixed , with \u03c6 f ixed representing the growth-rate invariant fraction of the proteome [6]. There are many factors contributing to the emergence of this burden on growing cells that, at the same time, express a heterologous protein. These mainly include the transcription, translation and folding of the foreign protein [5,",

            "text": "The most common E. coli-based expression system is the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter controlled gene expression combination. IPTGinduction of the chromosomally encoded bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase leads to high level expression of T7 promoter-controlled genes and correspondingly high recombinant protein titers. High level recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli frequently leads to an impact on host cell metabolism detectable through growth retardation and generally known as \"metabolic burden\" [1,2]. The factors contributing to the metabolic burden are multifaceted depending on the host/vector combination and on the properties of the encoded gene with its transcription and translation products as well as on the environmental conditions encountered during the production process [3][4][5][6]. The prime reasons for the protein production related metabolic burden have been attributed to protein translation and protein folding [1,6] as well as to transcription and plasmid amplification related processes [7][8][9]. However, production of the same protein under identical conditions in the same host/vector combination but with single codon exchanges can change the metabolic perturbations considerably [10][11][12][13] suggesting that the phenomenon is even more complex than anticipated. \n\nIn this contribution we analyze the impact of T7-promoter-controlled recombinant gene expression on the host cell metabolism using two different model proteins, the difficult-to-fold human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) with its high propensity to form inclusion bodies in E. coli and the easy-to-fold green fluorescent protein (GFP) mainly produced as soluble protein. \n\nFor both examples we generated a set of expression vectors in which either the ribosome binding site (RBS) or the promoter region or both were removed in order to analyze if the plasmid itself, the transcription of the recombinant gene, the translation into the protein product and/or protein folding related processes have an impact on host cell metabolism.",

The nature of the target proteins themselves, along with cost, ease of use, and speed, are typically cited as major factors to consider in production. Despite a wide variety of alternative expression systems, most recombinant proteins for research and therapeutics are produced in a limited number of systems: Escherichia coli , yeast, insect cells, and the mammalian cell lines HEK293 and CHO. Recent interest in Vibrio natriegens as a new bacterial recombinant protein expression host is due in part to its short doubling time of \u2264\u200910\u00a0min but also stems from the promise of compatibility with techniques and genetic systems developed for E. coli . We successfully incorporated V. natriegens as an additional bacterial expression system for recombinant protein production and report improvements to published protocols as well as new protocols that expand the versatility of the system. While not all proteins benefit from production in V. natriegens , we successfully produced several proteins that were difficult or impossible to produce in E. coli . We also show that in some cases, the increased yield is due to higher levels of properly folded protein. Additionally, we were able to adapt our enhanced isotope incorporation methods for use with V. natriegens . Taken together, these observations and improvements allowed production of proteins for structural biology, biochemistry, assay development, and structure-based drug design in V. natriegens that were impossible and/or unaffordable to produce in E. coli . Production of proteins with reduced aggregation compared to E. coli . Optimized protocols for efficiency and protein expression. Improved yield for specific proteins compared to E. coli .",

            "text": "We also revealed that disruption of the reducing pathways in the cytoplasm is not necessary for soluble production of disulfide bonded proteins [16]. However, all published research is based on cultures cultivated on rich media, such as LB or EnPressoB, and all grown in deep well plates or in shake flasks. Such small scale cultivations may be sufficient for protein production for academic research, but are not apt for industrial scale. Growth conditions in shake flasks are difficult to measure and cannot be easily controlled and hence large batch-to-batch variations may occur. In contrast, production in bioreactors allows key variables such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen level and nutrient supply to be regulated. Chemically defined minimal media is preferred for large scale of protein production since it provides full control over media composition, avoiding a lot-to-lot variability of undefined components, it therefore assures reproducibility of the process and the quality of the final product. In addition, it is free of animal derived components. The slower growth profile of the There was no significant difference in protein concentration between sheared and non-sheared cells indicating the E. coli strains with CyDisCo components are robust cells on defined minimal media may be beneficial for protein folding, while it still allows implementation of fedbatch cultivations yielding high cell densities [21]. In the present research we scaled up cultivations. \n\nHere we show that the limitation of E. coli cytoplasm for the production of recombinant disulfide-bonded proteins can be overcome by the introduction of CyDisCo components and that this system is feasible for scale-up to bioreactor cultures on chemically defined minimal media. In the present proof of concept research we scaled up cultivations of E. coli cultures producing recombinant proteins in presence of CyDisCo components to stirred tank bioreactors with expression under standard conditions 30 \u00b0C, pH = 7, pO 2 = 30% on chemically defined, minimal media and the process was successful.",

P BAD is well-known for its tight repression [31] while P tac is prone to leaky expression if LacI repressor levels are too low [41]. In our case, with the gene for LacI present on the pEXT21-derived plasmid, no expression was detectable in the absence of inducers for both promoters (Figures 3 and 4C).\n\nSeveral novel aspects of the E. coli in vivo system for glycoprotein production became apparent. First, the delayed appearance of glycoconjugates on immunoblots compared to the carrier proteins indicates that Nglycosylation was the rate-limiting step, assuming that polysaccharide precursors were not limiting. Second, slight differences in cultivation conditions such as presence of an additional carbon source or specific growth rate at induction had an unexpectedly strong effect on the efficiency of glycosylation, but carrier protein synthesis remained unaffected. Pre-induction growth rates have been shown to influence the yields of recombinant proteins in other studies [42,43], but mostly only one protein had to be expressed. A systematic analysis of how cell physiology influences the efficiency of glycosylation would be of high practical relevance, but was without the scope of this study.\n\nIn this work it was demonstrated for the first time that glycosylated proteins can be produced in recombinant E. coli at a larger scale in fed-batch culture. We used a semi-defined glycerol medium and a simple pulse feed strategy. Such a design had been used successfully by others in E. coli processes, e.g., for the production of bovine growth hormone [44]. It is clear that the time-space-yields for glycoconjugates produced in E. coli are still low compared to unmodified, cytoplasmic recombinant proteins for which productivities up to 0.2 g L -1 h -1 and final yields of several grams per litre can be reached [43][44][45][46].

Accordingly, where the product is a simpler protein, E. coli is often the ideal choice of production host. Indeed, the first recombinant therapeutic protein (human insulin) has been commercially produced in E. coli since 1982 (Baeshen et al., 2014). Many other commercial recombinant protein products including cytokines for cancer treatment or technical enzymes for industrial applications have been produced in E. coli, but its status as the gold standard prokaryotic host is mainly for historical reasons and a range of other prokaryotes may be more suitable (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016;Singh et al., 2016). In our laboratory, we use Pseudomonas fluorescens for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, which accumulate in the cytosol by default or can be secreted to the culture medium (Retallack et al., 2012). For example, we chose cytosolic accumulation for the production of a 19-kDa phenylalanine-free protein that can be used for the dietetic management of patients suffering from phenylketonuria -an inborn error metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Hoffmann et al., 2018). The phenylalanine-free protein can easily be extracted from the cells by high-pressure homogenization and isolated via a single affinity purification step (Figure 1). Simple medium-scale cultivation in 2.5-L shake flasks with a culture volume of 0.5-1.0 L achieved yields of 2.5 g/L.",

            "text": "Efficient strategies to produce recombinant proteins are gaining increasing importance, as more applications that require high amounts of high-quality proteins reach the market [1]. Higher production efficiencies, faster process development and deeper understanding of basic cellular physiology are required to advance the field. As recombinant protein production is built upon living organisms, the process development is almost never straightforward and often demands an empirical approach. To manipulate and understand cells better, they should be grown in a defined, ideally constant, controllable set of physico-chemical conditions [2]. The most basic system that can provide such conditions is a chemostat where cells are maintained in a steady-state growth environment by supplying them with a constant flow of nutrients and by simultaneous removal of spent culture medium at a defined rate [3,4]. Other parameters, such as temperature, pH, and oxygenation rate can be varied and controlled by the experimenter. Several variations of the basic chemostat cultivation method have been developed to study cells more rapidly while keeping the steady-state environment (for a review of the methods see [5]). Most often, continuous cultures have been applied to basic physiology studies of wild-type cells; but as the final volumetric productivity of a protein production process depends both on the specific product formation rate (q p ) and the specific growth rate (\u00b5), methods that allow the experimenter to control and monitor \u00b5 can also be advantageous for process development purposes. Besides microbial physiology studies and process development, there is an interest in continuous cultures to manufacture recombinant proteins [6,7], as the possibility of keeping cells in producing states for longer times has the potential to significantly increase the process productivities and reduce costs [8,9]. \n\nIn this review, we summarize how continuous cultures have been used to understand basics of recombinant cell physiology, for process development and industrial production of recombinant proteins. As semi-continuous perfusion processes have been used for mammalian cell-based recombinant processes for a long time and reviewed elsewhere [10][11][12], our review focuses on microorganisms.",

            "text": "In 2005, there were 4,200 biotechnology companies worldwide. Total revenue amounted to $63 billion. Recombinant DNA technology has been remarkably advanced by their development of efficient and scale-up expression systems to produce enzymes from industrially-unknown microorganisms and other living organisms using industrial organisms such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and other species of Bacillus, Ralstonia eutropha, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Saccharomyce cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha, and species of Aspergillus and Trichoderma [87]. Approximately 90% of industrial enzymes are recombinant versions. \n\nE. coli has been extensively used as a recombinant host for many reasons including (i) ease of quickly and precisely modifying the genome; (ii) rapid growth to high cell densities; (iii) ease of culture in cheap media; and (iv) ease of reduction of protease activity. E. coli can accumulate heterologous proteins up to 50% of its dry cell weight [88]. However, it has several drawbacks, such as: inability for post-translational modifications, presence of toxic cell wall pyrogens or, sometimes, formation of inclusion bodies containing inactive, aggregated and insoluble heterologous protein. \n\nDespite this, high level production and excretion has been obtained with the following heterologous proteins: alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) at 5.2 g/L into the periplasm, and levan fructotransferase LFT at 4 g/L into the medium. In 1993, recombinant processes in E. coli were responsible for almost $5 billion worth of products (87). R. eutropha produced organophosphohydrolase at 10 g/L [89]. The P. fluorescens culture of the Pfenex company is capable of producing 20 g/L of protein [90]. \n\nS. cerevisiae offers certain advantages over bacteria as a cloning host [91].",

            "text": "Cost. Recombinant proteins may be expressed in bacteria, fungi and yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, animals, or plants. The cost of the resulting product, especially downstream processing or purification cost has been described as the following. (1) The generation of recombinant proteins in bacterial system is faster and easier and thus allows for the easy progression to large-scale manufacturing [129]. Currently, the most widely used recombinant protein production systems are bacterial systems. However, the limitation of the presence of endogenously produced endotoxins and pathogens in E. coli is difficult and, therefore, costly to remove from target preparations and creates additional complexities [1]. (2) Foreign proteins production in yeasts and fungi offers the cost effectiveness and scaleup benefits of E. coli combined with the advantages of eukaryotic expression. Moreover, protein is expressed into the culture supernatant allowing faster and easier purification; as well, the purified protein contains less contaminating endotoxins as compared to the bacterially expressed counterparts [129]. However, they have a number of technical issues, such as the loss of plasmid and dramatic decrease in protein yield during large-scale production, which should be needed to resolve [1]. (3) Though insect cells have a number of advantages, several disadvantages exist. It has been shown that internal cleavage, at arginine-or lysine-rich sequences, is extremely inefficient and leads to improperly processed proteins. Furthermore, glycosylation capability is limited to only high mannosetype [1]. (4) There are currently many established mammalian cell lines for the production of proteins. It should be noted, however, that the development of large-scale expression techniques is time consuming and requires high initial financial investment. Also, this system requires a nutrient media that is more complex than that of bacteria, fungi, or plants. So, the cost of the resulting product is quite substantial [1,142]. ( 5) Transgenic technology has allowed for recombinant protein production in living animals such as rabbits, goats, pigs, and cows.",

            "text": "Plasmids are important vectors for the transfer of genetic material among microbes. The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production with Escherichia coli is usually carried out in fed-batch mode in industry. As set-up and cleaning of equipment are time- and cost-intensive, it would be economically and environmentally favorable to reduce the number of these procedures. Switching from fed-batch to continuous biomanufacturing with microbials is not yet applied as these cultivations still suffer from time-dependent variations in productivity. Repetitive fed-batch process technology facilitates critical equipment usage, reduces the environmental fingerprint and potentially increases the overall space-time yield. Surprisingly, studies on repetitive fed-batch processes for recombinant protein production can be found for yeasts only. Knowledge on repetitive fed-batch cultivation technology for recombinant protein production in E. coli is not available until now. In this study, a mixed feed approach, enabling repetitive fed-batch technology for recombinant protein production in E. coli, was developed. Effects of the cultivation mode on the space-time yield for a single-cycle fed-batch, a two-cycle repetitive fed-batch, a three-cycle repetitive fed batch and a chemostat cultivation were investigated. For that purpose, we used two different E. coli strains, expressing a model protein in the cytoplasm or in the periplasm, respectively. Our results demonstrate that a repetitive fed-batch for E. coli leads to a higher space-time yield compared to a single-cycle fed-batch and can potentially outperform continuous biomanufacturing. For the first time, we were able to show that repetitive fed-batch technology is highly suitable for recombinant protein production in E. coli using our mixed feeding approach, as it potentially (i) improves product throughput by using critical equipment to its full capacity and (ii) allows implementation of a more economic process by reducing cleaning and set-up times.",

Recombinant immunotoxins are currently produced intracellularly by E.coli [11,22,23,28] and extracellularly by yeast or plant [29,30]. In all of these systems, environmental conditions and composition of culture medium and cellular requirements have a significant impact on the production of immunotoxins. In the secretary systems, the toxicity of immunotoxin released to the environment negatively affects the rate of production and toxic effects of immunotoxin limits high-cell-density bioreactor production [29]. Therefore, the intracellular production of immunotoxins in the form of the inclusion bodies by cells with high growth rates such as E.coli is still of interest despite its obligatory refolding process.

In this study, it is shown that induced decoupling of growth and heterologous gene expression in the E. coli X\u2010press strain (derived from BL21(DE3)) facilitates extracellular recombinant protein production. The effect of the process parameters temperature and specific glucose consumption rate (qS) on growth, productivity, lysis and leakiness, is investigated, to find the parameter space allowing extracellular protein production. Two model proteins are used, Protein A (SpA) and a heavy\u2010chain single\u2010domain antibody (VHH), and performance is compared to the industrial standard strain BL21(DE3). It is shown that inducible growth repression in the X\u2010press strain greatly mitigates the effect of metabolic burden under different process conditions. Furthermore, temperature and qS are used to control productivity and leakiness. In the X\u2010press strain, extracellular SpA and VHH titer reach up to 349 and 19.6 mg g\u22121, respectively, comprising up to 90% of the total soluble product, while keeping cell lysis at a minimum. The findings demonstrate that the X\u2010press strain constitutes a valuable host for extracellular production of recombinant protein with E. coli.",

This strategy enabled the removal of unnecessary proportions of genome at large scale without causing palpable defects in the target organisms (except in a few instances [135,144]) and sometimes yielded improved cellular performances in terms of growth rates, cell density, transformation efficiency, and protein productivity compared with their wild-type counterparts. With an unintended discovery of the desirable properties that synthetic minimal genomes may convey in microbial production, several studies have explored their potential for industrial applications for recombinant protein production [145][146][147][148].

            "text": "In addition to CWDEs from wild-type bacteria, recombinant CWDEs can be produced by E. coli through high cell density fermentation. Differently from other fermentation methods, high cell density fermentation is characterized by the highest operating costs (Ferreira et al., 2018). The advantage of using E. coli as bioreactor resides in five main factors: (i) rapid growth cycle, (ii) use of cheap growth media, (iii) capability of reaching high cell density through fermentation, (iv) possibility of using strains with low proteolytic activity, and (v) a thorough knowledge of its physiology and genetics. However, the translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce post-translational modifications such as the formation of cytoplasmic disulphide bridges or glycosylation. Moreover, the poor ability of Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins in the culture medium implies expensive and time-consuming purification procedures, thus representing additional costs for their large-scale production (Table 2). To overcome this drawback, different approaches to enhance the secretion efficiency of recombinant CWDEs in E. coli have been developed. The yield of secreted recombinant cellulases and hemicellulases was increased by fusing the catalytic domain of the CWDE of interest to the CBM from another higher soluble cellulase (Murashima et al., 2003) or by reducing the temperature during expression in order to promote a correct protein folding (Song et al., 2012). Alternatively, expression hosts with higher secretion capabilities can be used such as the Grampositive bacteria B. subtilis (Morello et al., 2008) or Lactococcus lactis (Pohl and Harwood, 2010), and yeasts; the latter have higher secretion efficiency and can perform post-translational modifications.",

            "text": "In 1982, the recombinant protein technology achieved the great breakthrough with Humulin, a recombinant human insulin expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which was the first approved biopharmaceutical [1]. Since that time, more than 400 recombinant proteins were introduced to the market [2]. E. coli is still the most popular host organism for heterologous protein production due to its well-known genetics, high growth rates on inexpensive media, and a wide range of possible expression vectors [3]. \n\nRecombinant protein production always implicates a perturbation of the host cell metabolism, which typically leads to lower biomass growth rates [4][5][6]. This stems from high maintenance requirements for the replication of inserted plasmids and from the resources needed for the transcription of target genes [7][8][9]. Particularly, plasmids with high copy numbers can overburden the cell and induce a metabolic collapse, which results in low product yields or even cell death [10][11][12]. Thus, a good balance of biomass growth and product formation associated with unavoidable cell stress has to be found to achieve high productivity. Therefore, many parameters have to be individually optimized. This involves not only the choice of vector and promoter system, but also composition of the medium, oxygen supply, cultivation temperature and induction conditions [3,10,[13][14][15][16][17]. \n\nThe reduction of cultivation temperature is one of the common approaches to prevent formation of inclusion bodies by correct folding of the molecule [18][19][20]. Unfortunately, this comes along with prolonged cultivation times. A fast approach to investigate temperature effects in microtiter plates is through temperature profiling as described by Kunze et al. [21]. \n\nOne of the most frequently used expression systems is the E. coli T7 system under control of the lac operon, present in pET and pRhot vectors. The expression of the target protein can be induced with lactose or the nondegradable analog isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [22,23].",

            "text": "Biofilm systems have many advantages when compared with suspended growth systems, especially in their higher biomass density and operation stability. Biofilm reactors are able to retain 5 to 10 times more biomass per unit volume of reactor [15], thus increasing the production rates and reducing the risk of cell washout when operating at high dilution rates during continuous fermentation. Furthermore, biofilms provide a protective environment to the cells as the extracellular matrix protects them against extreme conditions of pH and temperature, contaminations, hydraulic shock, antibiotics and toxic substances [15]. Another advantage of biofilm cultures is that cells can be easily separated from the liquid by sedimentation or filtration, resulting in more efficient downstream processes [13]. \n\nRecombinant protein production in biofilms was first described 25 years ago by Huang et al. [20][21][22], who showed that the maximum \u03b2-galactosidase concentration obtained in E. coli DH5\u03b1 suspended cells was higher than that obtained in biofilm cells (0.47 vs. 0.12 pg/cell) [21]. On the other hand, the probability of plasmid loss in a biofilm culture was greater than that observed in suspended batch cultures [21]. These results suggested that the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by biofilm cells may compete with plasmid maintenance/replication and expression of an heterologous plasmid-encoded protein for metabolic intermediates and energy sources, a competition that suspended cells do not experience [21]. About 15 years later, O'Connell and colleagues [17] contradicted this previous work by demonstrating that the E. coli biofilm environment enhanced the heterologous protein production when compared to planktonic cells. This study was carried out with E. coli ATCC 33456 pEGFP, a strain that formed a robust biofilm and harbored a high copy number modified pUC vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP).",

            "text": "ecombinant production of proteins enables biochemical and structural studies, and the pET vectors hosted in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) are the most popular approach in research laboratories 1 . Fast growth, high cell density, inexpensive culturing, availability of more than 100 pET expression vectors 2 combined with the detailed knowledge of E. coli's genetics, physiology and metabolism make it the preferred laboratory workhorse. 3 This is evident from the more than 200,000 research publications that have cited the use of the pET vectors, and that currently more than 128,000 (86% of the recombinant) structures in the Protein Data Bank and approximately half of the proteins produced worldwide for research and commercial use are produced in E. coli 2,4 . This remarkable success is despite that bacteria often show impaired growth and fitness-loss when being used for protein production 5 -a problem that is highly gene-specific, and we still lack clear guiding principles for gene and cell factory optimisation 6 . \n\nMembrane proteins (MPs) are important drug targets and serve essential roles in basic cellular mechanisms. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, 20-30% of all genes encode membrane proteins. 7 MPs are involved in fundamental mechanisms such as transport of nutrients and signal molecules, response to environmental changes, membrane stability, maintenance of the redox potential, defence and energy conversion. With natural abundances often too low to isolate sufficient material for in vitro studies, structural and biochemical investigations are limited by our ability to produce and purify MPs recombinantly in a functional state. \n\nMPs are also notoriously known for causing burden in expression systems. They need to be properly inserted into the membrane and cannot be produced in inclusion bodies. This often leads to an overload of the membrane translocation machinery and has previously been reported to severely hamper protein homoeostasis in the cytoplasm leading to the accumulation of aggregates of proteases, chaperones, and overexpressed MPs 5,8,9 . In addition, competition for the limited space of the membrane causes decreased levels of key respiratory chain complexes and upregulation of the Arc two-component system, indicating serious alterations in central metabolism 5 .",

A synthetic enzymatic glucose release medium was employed to provide carbon limited growth conditions without external substrate feed and the required buffer capacity to keep the pH value within 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01. Accurate process design allowed for cultivation up to cell densities of 10\u00a0g\u00a0biomass\u00a0l\u22121 without any limitations in oxygen supply [dissolved oxygen (DO) level above 30\u00a0%]. In the micro-bioreactor system (BioLector) online monitoring of cell growth, DO and pH was performed. Furthermore, the influence of the cultivation temperature, the applicability for different host strains as well as the transferability of results to lab-scale bioreactor cultivations was evaluated.ConclusionThis robust microtiter plate cultivation protocol allows for screening of E. coli systems under conditions comparable to lab-scale bioreactor cultivations.",

            "text": "BackgroundThe Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli has been widely used as a cell factory for the production of proteins and specialty chemicals because it is the best characterized host with many available expression and regulation systems. However, recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli are generally intracellular and often found in the form of inclusion bodies. Extracellular production of proteins is advantageous compared with intracellular production because extracellular proteins can be purified more easily and can avoid protease attack, which results in higher product quality. In this study, we found a catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) and its N-terminus can be employed as carriers for extracellular production of recombinant proteins.ResultsIn this report, we identified the catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) from Bacillus sp. that can be secreted into the medium from recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) in large quantities without its native signal peptide. By subcellular location analysis, we proved that the secretion was a two-step process and the N-terminal sequence of the full length Cel-CD played a crucial function in secretion. Both the Cel-CD and its N-terminal sequence can serve as carriers for efficient extracellular production of select target proteins.ConclusionsFusion of heterologous proteins with N20 from Cel-CD can carry the target proteins out of the cells with a concentration from 101 to 691\u00a0mg/L in flask cultivation. The extracellular recombinant proteins with a relative high purity. The results suggested that this system has a potential application in plant biomass conversion and industrial production of enzymes and therapeutic proteins.",

            "text": "Prokaryotic host systems such as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis are widely used for protein overproduction and allow to obtain large quantities of recombinant proteins in a short time. When pursuing industrial production, there is a preference for bacterial hosts that are fast-growing, wellestablished, and cost-effective. Novel prokaryotic platform based on V. natriegens offers many advantages over widely used host systems for protein production at laboratory and industrial scales. V. natriegens is gram-negative, non-pathogenic bacterium with shorter doubling time than E. coli (< 10 min) (Payne et al. 1961). It has a rapid proteosynthesis and exceptionally high biomass specific consumption rate (qs) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Hoffart et al. 2017). Moreover, V. natriegens possesses a robust metabolism, utilise various substrates and grows rapidly on low-cost media (Kormanov\u00e1 et al. 2020). Moreover, V. natriegens offers great metabolic capacity for intracellular and potentially extracellular protein production than E. coli (Schwarz et al. 2022). \n\nExtracellular secretion offers several advantages over intracellular production, including simplifying downstream processes and improving the biological activity, solubility, and stability. Additionally, an extracellular production strategy becomes crucial when dealing with the expression of toxic proteins (Yoon et al. 2010). Similar to E. coli, V. natriegens has limited secretion capacity and typically cannot produce recombinant proteins in sufficient quantities directly into the growth medium (Cornelis 2000;Yoon et al. 2010). One of the extracellular production strategies includes a specific translocation across inner cytoplasmatic membrane using a secretion signal and translocation machinery. Especially TSS1 and TSS2 have been widely used for secretion of recombinant proteins in E. coli (Korotkov et al. 2012). However, one of the main drawbacks are a limited capacity of these machineries, weak secretion signal or size of secreted proteins. When the transport mechanism reaches its capacity, proteins have a tendency to form insoluble aggregates.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production has led to a revolution in basic research and biotechnology and biotherapeutic industries and plays a key role in the treatment of a wide range of major diseases. Currently, the majority of commercial recombinant proteins are produced using either bacterial or eukaryotic cell expression systems dependent upon the structural complexity and cell-dependent modifications required to obtain functional protein. The Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli is an attractive system for recombinant protein production at both academic and industrial scales. It is not only cheap and easy to culture in batches to high densities, but a wide range of strains, reagents, promoters, and tools have been developed to facilitate the production of functional proteins in E. coli. In addition, the application of synthetic biology strategies is now overcoming limitations commonly associated with the application of post-translational modifications and folding of complex proteins. 1 ere, we describe an innovative expression system that induces packaging of a diverse range of recombinant proteins into membrane vesicles in E. coli. We identify a simple peptide tag that results in high yields of vesicle-packaged functional proteins and allows compartmentalization of otherwise toxic, insoluble, and disulfide bond-containing proteins, as well as extracellular release of vesicles into the media for efficient downstream processing. These released protein-packed vesicles support rapid isolation from the media and also provide a micro-environment for stable, long-term storage of functional recombinant proteins. Thus, this system provides significant benefit for a wide range of applications from discovery science to applied biotechnology and medicine. \n\nMOTIVATION The ability to reprogram a cell to direct the packaging of specific molecules into discrete membrane envelopes is one of the major challenges in the fields of synthetic biology and recombinant protein today. We thus set out to develop a system to allow the export of vesicle-packaged proteins from Escherichia coli.",

            "text": "The high effective production of recombinant proteins based on lignocellulosic sugars was initially demonstrated using the fluorescence reporter eGFP as a prominent model. Astonishingly, the recombinant E. coli strains, those expressing eGFP rather than those harbouring the corresponding empty vector, reached significantly higher cell densities during the cultivations. Usually, the selection pressure by the added antibiotics and the constitutive expression of antibiotic resistance genes in response as well as the general plasmid maintenance induce a stress response, especially when an additional target protein is highly expressed (Hoffmann & Rinas, 2004;Hoffmann et al., 2002). Such improved growth performances of recombinant strains were frequently described, but the reasons are very speculative (Yee & Blanch, 1992). However, the response to the high expression of recombinant protein includes an extensive reprogramming of gene expression patterns and down regulation of several housekeeping genes (Hoffmann et al., 2002), which probably provides more energy resources for other cellular functions. \n\nThis improved growth behaviour was further observed during the heterologous expression of bovine and human \u03b1 S1 -casein in E. coli BL21(DE3). In addition to its highlyefficient protein biosynthesis depending on the T7 expression system, this host was chosen because it lacks the Lon and the OmpT proteases (Studier & Moffatt, 1986). Furthermore, the successful production of other recombinant milk proteins was also reported for this strain (Garc\u00eda-Montoya et al., 2013;Goda et al., 2000;Hansson et al., 1993;Ponniah et al., 2010;Simons et al., 1993;Wang et al., 1989). However, this strain still possesses further proteases like the ATP-dependent Clp proteases, which are known to degrade a variety of proteins through multiple site cleavage (Thompson et al., 1994).",

The number of biopharmaceuticals on the market is just over 200 products, and systems based on mammalian cells and Escherichia coli remain the workhorses of biopharmaceutical production [1]. Production platforms are selected based on complexity: E coli expression is preferred when small proteins with non-post-translational modifications need to be produced; meanwhile Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines are preferred when larger proteins with posttranslational modifications are the products.\n\nRecent advances in metabolic engineering, systems biology and high-throughput screening approaches have added new developments. Heterologous protein production is improving because the limitations of some production systems -mainly bacteria and yeasts -have been overcome using Synthetic Biology. Engineered microorganisms can perform complicated post-translational modifications including better disulfide bond formation [2], the first steps of glycosylation in E. coli [3 ], highly enhanced secretion in yeast [4], or glycosylated protein production for therapeutic use in humanized yeast (discussed elsewhere in this issue) [5]. Moreover, our preconceptions of therapeutic protein production have changed with the incursion of new technologies, including the cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems, which have made possible cost-effective manufacturing scale synthesis of complex proteins [6].\n\nWithin the group of biopharmaceuticals, next generation vaccines will play an important role in global health. Genomics and systems biology have contributed enormously to our understanding of human immunology [7], and this added knowledge has resulted in new technologies that may reach the market soon. New vaccines based on virus-like particles represent an advance in the development of safer vaccines, with less side effects and improved immunogenicity. This review will focus on virus-like particle production in microbial factories and cell-free systems and the future of these therapeutic technologies in vaccinology and gene delivery systems.",

            "text": "A wide range of platforms is available for production of recombinant proteins and each of the systems offers many amenities. Recombinant biopharmaceuticals can be synthetized in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells including bacteria, yeasts, insect cells, filamentous fungi, microalgae, mammalian cells, and transgenic animal and plant organisms [7,8]. The properties of the target protein-its structure and biological activity-dictate the choice of its production platform. The better a protein of interest is characterized, the easier it can be extracted and purified. The main difference between possible various expression systems reflects the anatomy of a cell. Bacterial cells do not possess a nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or Golgi apparatus, which play a substantial role in transport and posttranslational modification (PTM). The humanlike splicing of mRNA is usually provided by mammalian or insect cells. However, working on these hosts might be too timeconsuming and expensive. Hence, other systems may turn out to be more affordable and efficient. Therefore, great attention should be paid to the choice of platform for the production of recombinant pharmaceuticals to gain scalability and high yield. In this review, systems for the production of recombinant proteins are concisely characterized and compared. A comparison of the production systems is presented in Table 1. 2.1. Bacteria. The bacterial system of the production of recombinant protein therapeutics is believed to be attractive on account of low costs, rapid bacteria growth, and medium productivity. Escherichia coli is a model organism characterized with well-known biochemistry and genetics; hence it is no surprise that this host is predominant among the bacterial platforms of expression (e.g., Pseudomonas or Streptomyces system). Genetic manipulations in E. coli are simple and straightforward. When the production of recombinant therapeutics concerns membrane proteins, the Lactococcus lactis system is commonly considered [9,10].\n\nThe bacterial system is easy to culture and low priced.

            "text": "The wide variability in the expression levels of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli remains a major challenge for biotechnologists. While some proteins are routinely expressed at 30-40% of total cellular protein (TCP) (Joly and Swartz 1997;Kim et al. 2003;Suzuki et al. 2006), others may reach a maximum of only 5% of TCP (Kiefer et al. 2000). The uses of strong promoters, removal of codon bias and media design are favored strategies for improving recombinant protein yield (Acosta-Rivero et al. 2002;Hale and Thompson 1998). It is important to note that most scale up strategies involving high cell density cultures tend to increase biomass concentrations and hence volumetric product concentrations rather than the specific product yield in terms of product formed per unit biomass (Y p/x ). This yield remains an intrinsic property of the host-vector-gene combination used for expression. Improvements in host vector systems has tended to focus on developing high copy number plasmids with strong tightly regulatable promoters (Bowers et al. 2004;Jones et al. 2000;Wild and Szybalski 2004) along with protease free and recombination deficient strains (Meerman and Georgiou 1994;Ratelade et al. 2009). The focus has thus primarily been on enhancing the metabolic flux of the recombinant protein expression pathway, with few studies on analyzing how the gene products interact with the host cell machinery to depress its own expression.\n\nIt has been routinely observed that the specific growth rate of recombinant cultures declines post induction. Earlier authors had correlated this decline to be a measure of the metabolic burden associated with recombinant production (Bentley et al. 1990;Seo and Bailey 1985). It was postulated that the availability of critical metabolites was reduced since they were diverted to product formation, leading to a concomitant decline in the specific growth rate (Babaeipour et al. 2007). It is therefore to be expected that the decline in growth should be most severe when expression levels are maximum. However in most cases there seems to be no such correlation since severe growth retardation is observed when some proteins are expressed in fairly low amounts (Bhattacharya et al.",

            "text": "The use of recombinant proteins has increased with the advent of various expression hosts that facilitate their soluble, biologically active, and large-scale production. Although mammalian expression systems possess many advantages (Wurm 2004), the bacterial expression system is considered the most efficient host compared to other organisms for the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals because of its various attributes, including high expression yield, cost-effectiveness, rapid protein expression, and proficient scale-up. E. coli is considered the most promising bacterial strain for recombinant protein production; however, it lacks machinery for posttranslational modifications that can lead to inefficient protein folding and aggregation (in the form of inclusion bodies) (Stewart et al. 1998; Bessette et al. 1999). Aggregation can affect the biological activity and stability of therapeutic proteins and is considered a risk factor for increased immunogenicity. The major challenges in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies are isolation, washing, solubilization, and refolding procedures (Clark 2001;Middelberg 2002). Much effort is required for the development of a robust procedure for producing industrial-grade proteins that are stable, properly folded, and free from aggregation. \n\nThe co-expression of target proteins with soluble fusion partners for heterologous protein production in E. coli can lead to enhanced expression and efficient purification. Exploiting its chaperoning properties, the SUMO tag allows high-level expression through proper folding of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004;Butt et al. 2005). A high soluble protein expression level can be attained using this fusion system, yielding approximately 30% of the total soluble protein fraction in E. coli (Wang et al. 2010). The SUMO protease recognizes the SUMO fusion partner, facilitating precise proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in the production of native proteins. pET SUMO has been widely used to produce many therapeutically important proteins, including human interferon alpha-2a (Bis et al. 2014), BMP-14 (Li et al. 2011), human interleukin-11 (Nguyen et al. 2018), andFGF-21 (Wang et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Large-scale and low-cost production methods are required for the production of recombinant proteins (22). The use of prokaryotic expression systems to produce recombinant proteins is very affordable, but the production of recombinant proteins with correct PTM and proper folding in a prokaryotic system remains a major challenge (23). Although mammalian expression systems such as the CHO cell lines can be used to overcome the aforementioned challenges, the expression of recombinant proteins in these systems increases the cost and risk of contamination with animal viruses and decreases the speed and yield of recombinant protein production (24). Leishmania, the newly introduced host, can be used as an expression system to produce recombinant proteins with correct PTM and folding. Leishmania has several advantages, for example, it grows faster than mammalian cells, no expensive equipment is needed, and the risk of contamination is lower (25). However, Leishmania is usually cultured in expensive media, which may affect the final cost of recombinant protein production. \n\nWild types and mutants (expressing proteins) of I.L.L. showed almost the same growth pattern in the different media studied. Analysis of OD of all culture media confirmed the result of Neubauer counting of cells. The shape and motility of I.L.L. were checked under an inverted microscope and except in a medium with more than 10% FBS, I.L.L. had normal shape and good motility. In media with 30-50% FBS, the I.L.L. had a circular shape. Based on our experiment, we found that the I.L.L. in the M199 medium had a better growth rate than in the other three main media. The growth rate of I.L.L. in LB broth and RPMI1640 medium was the same. Moreover, agitated and static cultures had the same growth rate, which means that agitated culture does not improve the growth rate of I.L.L. In addition, the LB broth showed better results than the LB prepared according to the Sambrook protocol.",

We previously described an iron-enriched chemically defined minimal medium (M9i) which supports the cultivation of E. coli at high cell densities (Joachim et al., 2018). Here we tested the ability of M9i medium to support the growth of a glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase deficient ( gor trxB) E. coli strain for the cytoplasmic production of recombinant proteins with disulfide bonds. As a model product, we expressed the insect metalloprotease inhibitor (IMPI), an AMP with five disulfide bonds (Wedde et al., 1998), fused to an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) to facilitate product recovery. ELPs contain a repetitive pentapeptide (VPGXG), where the guest residue X can be any amino acid except proline, which allows reversible precipitation at a given transition temperature (Meyer and Chilkoti, 1999;Trabbic-Carlson et al., 2004;Banki et al., 2005;Hassouneh et al., 2010). We created a fed-batch process with a stirrer and aeration cascade for dissolved oxygen (DO) control. We then scaled up the process using the combined transfer criteria of constant DO and matching volumetric power inputs at the borders of the stirrer cascade. Using this approach, we investigated the industrial potential of redox-engineered E. coli combined with iron-enriched chemically defined M9i minimal medium at different feed rates and times of induction to achieve process intensification.",

            "text": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a revolutionary tool in genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing. Cas9, an enzyme derived from bacteria, is guided by RNA to edit DNA sequences within cells precisely. However, while CRISPR-Cas9 presents notable benefits and encouraging outcomes as a molecular tool and a potential therapeutic agent, the process of producing and purifying recombinant Cas9 protein remains a formidable hurdle. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression of recombinant SpCas9-His in four distinct Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains (Rosetta2, BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)-pLysS, and BL21(DE3)-Star). Through optimization of culture conditions, including temperature and post-induction time, the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain demonstrated efficient SpCas9 protein expression. This study also presents a detailed protocol for the purification of recombinant SpCas9, along with detailed troubleshooting tips. Results indicate successful SpCas9 protein expression using E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS at 0.5 mM IPTG concentration. Furthermore, the findings suggest potential avenues for further enhancements, paving the way for large-scale Cas9 production. This research contributes valuable insights into optimizing E. coli strains and culture conditions for enhanced Cas9 expression, offering a step forward in the development of efficient genome editing tools and therapeutic proteins.",

            "text": "In 2009 almost one third (45 out of 151) of commercial biopharmaceutical recombinant proteins licensed by FDA and EMEA were produced by cultivation of Escherichia coli [1]. This meant that nearly 30% of high-value recombinant proteins were produced by means of a plasmid-based expression system. Various other commercial recombinant proteins (e.g. enzymes) or non-protein products (e.g. amino acids) were also obtained with strains of E. coli harboring plasmids. Searching the Science Citation Index database for \"coli recombinant protein\" would lead to more than 26,000 results. These facts show the high importance of E. coli as an expression system for commercial as well as scientific use.\n\nExpression systems based on E. coli depend in almost all cases on the presence of at least one plasmid, which has to be segregated into dividing cells during growth. Insufficient segregational plasmid stability would render plasmid-based expression systems useless. Therefore, a variety of methods have been developed in order to achieve plasmid stability [2]. The commonly used method consists in adding antibiotics into the cultivation medium and placing genes for antibiotic resistance on the plasmid carrying the target gene. This strategy is widely used in research, since most often only low working volumes have to be applied. In industrial biotechnology, the addition of antibiotics can be generally excludednot only with respect to economic reasons. The elimination of antibiotics from media and waste streams maybe required during downstream processing. Therefore, other methods for plasmid stabilization are in high demand.\n\nA simple strategy in trying to keep a high segregational plasmid stability without adding antibiotics consists in using plasmids of high copy number and expecting that the statistical distribution of plasmids during cell division may always yield cells with at least some plasmids. This works fine as long as the average plasmid copy number is homogeneous [3]. As soon as cells with very low plasmid copy numbers show up preferentially during high growth rates, cells might have not enough time to synthesize plasmids in high copy numbers. Caused by the additional metabolic burden, plasmids may be lost completely, since",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that Dps possesses antimicrobial activity. Chuancone and Ceci have reported that Dps family members contain a ferroxidase center that is highly conserved among more than 300 bacterial species [21]. However, whether the antibacterial function and mechanism of action of Dps are common properties in bacteria remains unclear and is worth investigating in the future. \n\nThe production of various recombinant proteins, such as hormones, enzymes, antimicrobial proteins, and protein drugs, by the E. coli expression system has been widely applied in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. In the present study, the plasmid pET-peocin was transferred into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression of recombinant peocin, and most of the recombinant peocin was expressed in soluble form in E. coli. Although reports have shown that slowing of bacterial growth to retard protein synthesis and folding by reduction of temperature is an efficient approach to increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins [23,24], this strategy is invalid in this case. For mass production of peocin from recombinant E. coli, an alternative to flask cultivation is required. Fed-batch cultivation of E. coli via a pH-stat-based strategy provided an easy and efficient approach for manipulation to improve the biomass production yield [25]. The feeding of nutrients was activated based on an increase in pH beyond the set threshold due to the depletion of glucose. This feeding mechanism ensures that the fed-batch culture can maintain a low glucose concentration (below 1.8 g/L) to prevent the accumulation of acetic acid, which is overproduced under oxygen-limiting conditions and is well known as an inhibitor of cell growth and recombinant protein expression in E. coli. Several studies have reported high-cell-density cultivation (>100 g/L DCW) of recombinant E. coli by supplying pure oxygen to prevent acetate accumulation [25,26]; however, the high cost and safety risks associated with pure oxygen lead to challenges in the scale-up of this process for industrial applications.",

            "text": "The development of recombinant insulin and its production in Escherichia coli in the 1980s [1] launched an industry that comprises billion dollar markets, with products ranging from protein biologics ($91B) [2] to industrial enzymes ($4.8B) [3,4]. In recent years, the chemical and structural diversity of protein products has expanded rapidly, with targets such as short anti-microbial peptides [5], antibody-like binding proteins for diagnostics [6], and protein biomaterials [7,8]. These vast differences in physicochemical properties call for a variety of strategies to ensure that production of heterologous proteins is robust and scalable. \n\nSecreting protein to the extracellular space increases initial purity and thus can decrease the complexity of downstream processing. Eukaryotic hosts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or HEK 293 cells secrete recombinant proteins through their native secretion machinery at high titers [9][10][11][12]. Mammalian cells, however, are slow growing, expensive to culture, have large batch to batch variations, and can be difficult to genetically engineer [10,13]. Yeasts typically are faster growing but can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation [14]. \n\nBacterial hosts offer fast growth, relative genetic simplicity, and genetic stability [15]. Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces lividans allow protein secretion directly to the extracellular medium through the general secretory pathway, as they lack an outer membrane (OM). Secretion stress response systems and folding chaperones provide extracellular quality control. B. subtilis has a high secretion capacity-titers on the order of grams per liter have been achieved [16][17][18]. Compatibility with heterologous proteins is largely limited to enzymes, however, and extracellular proteolytic degradation is a significant product quality issue [19]. S. lividans has low extracellular protease activity while retaining a high secretion capacity.",

            "text": "We, therefore, aimed at expressing SLF2 as a complete protein molecule, however despite the use of several E. coli expression systems, no significant expression was observed. This lack of expression in E. coli could be due to un-optimized factors responsible for the efficiency of heterologous protein production such as biased codon usage and mRNA secondary structure [12,40]. As a result, mammalian cell expression systems were investigated as transient expression systems that allow extra-chromosomal amplification of plasmids and hence permit more plasmid copies to persist in the transfected cells during the production phase for a significant increase in gene expression. The large-scale expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells has been shown to generate sufficient amounts of recombinant protein for early production and high-throughput screening in functional studies [41]. However, the expression of SLF/SFB recombinant proteins in mammalian cells requires optimization of the technique to improve the transfection procedure through increasing speed and reducing the costs, all of which can possibly make mammalian cells more suitable for SLF/ SFB recombinant protein expression. We further assessed the use of protoplasts isolated from plants as means for the transient expression of recombinant proteins. Protoplasts retain their cell identity and show high transformation efficiency while requiring low maintenance [42]. Despite the successful use of protoplast expression system as a recombinant expression system by other scientists such as Wu et al., very faint expression of the SLF2 protein was observed in this study. \n\nAnother system examined in this study is the cell-free/in vitro expression system that can synthesize proteins in a high speed and accurate manner. The results obtain from this analysis suggest very low levels of expression. The in vitro system, by eliminating the need to manipulate whole cells in culture is a suitable technique for automated, high-throughput expression of a large number of proteins. However, the very low productivity i.e. less than 30 \u03bcg protein/ml reaction of this system limits its applicability and make it unfeasible compared to cellbased systems. \n\nSubsequently, the optimization of the E. coli system to express SLF/ SFB gene was considered using artificial gene synthesis.",

We have selected E. coli to express the recombinant PEDV-S1 because it has been proven to be a very good host for the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins, and for many purposes E. coli is the best host [24][25][26]. The recent advances in physiology and genetics of the E. coli at molecular level offer a great opportunity for the rapid and economical production of recombinant proteins [27]. It has previously been shown that genetically fused purification tag enhances the level of purity and protein recovery [27,28]. \n\nHere in this study, we have optimized various growth parameters (cultivation temperature, inducer concentration, culture media, pre-and post-induction incubation), this study was successful in obtaining highly pure PEDV-S1 in milligram quantities from shake flask experiments.",

Because of its ability to rapidly grow in a high-density environment in a low-cost medium, its well-defined genetic traits, and the multiplicity of cloning vectors and mutant host strains, E. coli offers an efficient and cost-effective method for the rapid and high-yield production of proteins. The use of bacterial hosts in the context of producing recombinant toxins and fusion proteins necessitates either resistance to the toxin or the capability to facilitate the accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in organelles that spatially separate the produced toxin from its molecular target, potentially preventing unwanted cytotoxic effects within the host cell. This spatial separation can enhance the overall yield of the desired product. \n\nConcerning the production of RITs in Escherichia coli, the absence of N-linked glycosylation may lead to differences in the behavior of the expressed monoclonal antibodies compared to those produced in mammalian cells. This can include changes in antibody binding strength, serum persistence, and a possible immunogenic response. In bacteria, mAb-based RITs are incorrectly folded and assembled, necessitating costly multi-step refolding processes, which frequently begin with denatured inclusion bodies. \n\nIn summary, the choice of a prokaryotic host for toxins or RIT production involves considerations related to both resistance to the toxin and the cellular localization of the POI. These factors play a crucial role in optimizing the production and guaranteeing increased production of the recombinant immunotoxin.",

            "text": "With increasing demand for pharmaceutical proteins nowadays, more and more people are devoted to development of efficient biomanufacturing processes for proteins. Escherichia coli (E. coli), as one of the most commonly used host bacteria to express recombinant proteins, has many advantages. For example, high cell density cultures are easily achieved (Lee, 1996), transformation with exogenous genes is fast (Pope and Kent, 1996), and its use as a cell factory is well-established (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). However, commercial production of recombinant proteins by E. coli has remained a challenge. One of the most important problems is that E. coli has a poor ability to secrete proteins, which causes formation of inclusion bodies, low production titers, and complicated downstream purification procedures (Kim et al., 2015). To improve protein secretion efficiency in E. coli, some common strategies have been developed, such as selection of efficient signal peptides like the signal sequences from OmpA (Sun et al., 2019) and PelB (Mohajeri et al., 2016) that usually target proteins to the secretion machinery efficiently. Modification of key transporter proteins or auxiliary proteins involved in transmembrane transport also has been applied to increase the efficiency of protein secretion (Low et al., 2010). In addition, fusion of some peptide tags or proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), also have proved to increase protein expression and extracellular secretion. Other strategies to improve protein secretion include fermentation process parameters control and medium optimization, such as addition of surfactants, osmolytes, metal ions, and glycine to the medium. \n\nRecombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), a potential therapeutic protein that has been widely used as a healing agent for various chronic wounds, was successfully produced extracellularly in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pectate lyase B (PelB) signal peptide (Sriwidodo et al., 2019).",

            "text": "compared with other microalgae. For instance, maximum yields observed in photosynthetic algae (C. reinhardtii) are 15 mg/l in a system based in the secretion of the target protein using either synthetic glycomodules (tandem serine and proline repeats) that improve secretion or a mutant strain that efficiently expresses heterologous genes (Bayne et al., 2013;Lauersen et al., 2013;Ramos-Martinez et al., 2017). Another promising approach relies in chloroplast genome engineering, by which yields up to 3 mg/L have been achieved (Gimpel et al., 2015). However Schizochytrium sp. does not possesses this organelle.\n\nIn this context, Algevir is a robust and attractive system as it possesses the following advantages that override the mentioned limitations: nuclear expression offers the possibility to access the complex cellular machinery to perform complex posttranslational modifications (e.g., glycosylation); intracellular accumulation at high levels of the biopharmaceutical allows using the alga cell as the delivery vehicle in oral formulations; inducible expression allows a tight control that might lead to an efficient production of recombinant proteins that have toxic effects in algae; transient expression avoids the long time investment required to select stably transformed clones. Therefore, Algevir is a versatile system offering the advantages of transient expression (short production time and high yields) that are ideal for the production of vaccines in response to epidemics.\n\nConventional systems for recombinant protein production allow overall higher yields than those of the microalgae-based systems. For instance bacterial systems have a productivity in the order of 5 g/l, yeast systems in the order of 30 g/l, whereas mammalian cells are in the range of 5-25 g/l (Jarvis, 2008;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). However, besides yields it should also be considered that bacterial systems often led to significant losses when refolding is required, the system has limitations for the synthesis of complex proteins and the host produces endotoxins (Feng et al., 2012). In the case of mammalian cells, the limitations are high production cost and possible contamination with human pathogens (",

We compared the overall performance of scale-down cultivations, using a two-compartment setup consisting of a stirred tank reactor (STR) combined with a plugflow reactor (PFR), with lab-scale cultivations in a classical STR as reference. The two setups had the same size of 20 L and the only difference of the used processes were the connection of the plug-flow compartment at feed start. By generation of heterogeneities in the PFR of the scale-down setup, conditions similar to the ones in large-scale (m 3 range) bioreactors were generated.

One measurement point (MP) was located in the STR and four MPs were analyzed along the PFR. The MPs in the PFR correspond to residence times (RT) of 5 s (sec), 13 s, 20 s and 33 s, respectively. For B < oFTN2 >, acidification along the PFR occurred faster at the beginning, but slowed down after longer RT in the PFR. The pH during H < oFTN2 > cultivations reached a plateau between MP1 to MP3 and then dropped from MP3 to MP4. Therefore, acidification during H < oFTN2 > cultivations was slower at smaller RT, but higher at the end of the PFR, compared to cultivations with B < oFTN2 > . Oxygen consumption rate was also different along the P",

            "text": "To scale-up the production of the peocin protein, pH-stat-based fed-batch cultivation was used for high-cell-density production of recombinant E. coli in a 5-L bioreactor. The initial glucose (20 g/L) in the bioreactor was gradually consumed, accompanied by cell growth during the batch culture period. Feeding with 28% ammonium hydroxide (v/v) was activated to maintain a natural pH and supply a nitrogen source during cultivation when the pH value was less than 6.9. After 7.5 h of cultivation, the initial glucose was exhausted, and the addition of feeding solution was triggered due to the increase in pH to a value higher than the set value of 7.1. Subsequently, the culture temperature was shifted to 30 \u2022 C from 37 \u2022 C to avoid accumulation of the byproduct acetate. Because glucose was the limiting parameter during fed-batch cultivation, the glucose concentration was maintained below 1.8 g/L, and the acetate concentration was maintained below 1.5 g/L during the complete cultivation process. A high biomass of 30.2 g/L DCW was obtained after 30 h of cultivation, and more than 92% plasmid stability was observed at the end of cultivation (Figure 4A). To evaluate the production efficiency of recombinant peocin at the time of induction, cells were induced with 0.1 mM at the early exponential phase (6 h), midexponential phase (12 h), and late exponential phase (18 h) of growth. When cells were induced in the early exponential phase, the peocin content increased rapidly for 9 h post induction, and then, a constant expression level of peocin was maintained until the end of cultivation. The DCW and recombinant peocin content at the end of cultivation were 15.3 \u00b1 0.82 g/L and 32.1 \u00b1 1.32%, respectively (Figure 4B). When cells were induced at midexponential phase, the peocin content increased for 6 h post induction and then decreased slightly until the end of cultivation.",

            "text": "Proteins play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis, providing structure, and enabling various functions in biological systems. The study of proteins was a complex task before the advent of genetic engineering because they had to be obtained from natural sources with low concentrations, making purification processes challenging and yielding limited amounts. However, the development of recombinant DNA technology has allowed science to make a qualitative leap in this field of research. The production of recombinant insulin in Escherichia coli in the 1970s was a significant milestone, not only revolutionizing the treatment of diabetes but also initiating the use of recombinant proteins for a wide number of applications [1,2]. This breakthrough sparked a surge in biological and structural studies on proteins. Over the past nearly 50 years, the market for recombinant proteins in industries, biomedicine, and research has continued to expand, underscoring the importance of this biotechnological field [3]. Therapeutic proteins are now used in human health for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, infectious disorders, hemophilia, and anemia, and serve as indispensable tools in the diagnosis of numerous diseases [4]. In addition, recombinant proteins are used in animal production and health [5]. Moreover, the production of recombinant proteins has contributed to an exponential growth in scientific knowledge concerning the three-dimensional structure of proteins and has been instrumental in elucidating their functions [6,7]. Therefore, achieving controlled and high-performance production systems for recombinant proteins remains a top priority. \n\nDespite advances in understanding the physiology of producing cells and the physicochemical characteristics of proteins, obtaining certain recombinant proteins still poses technological challenges due to high protein complexity and the intricacies of biological production systems. In some environments, recombinant proteins may undergo proteolysis, aggregation, or be produced in meager quantities [8]. Homologous expression systems offer an effective alternative for producing eukaryotic proteins that often undergo complex post-translational modifications. These systems create conditions favoring the accumulation of functional proteins.",

            "text": "Furthermore, studies and the development of new protocols show that intelligent growth systems are not only beneficial when applied for the production of proteins or peptides, but can also increase the yield of isolated plasmid [77]. The production of gene-libraries is often limited to the amount of plasmid produced. Additionally, a large number of samples needs to be handled in parallel and requires a robotic set-up to enable automated handling. This on the other hand demands downscaling of the culture volume. It would be of great benefit to achieve a high optical density in a small cultivation volume. Pilarek et al. [78] and Grunzel et al. [77] showed that it is possible to miniaturize E. coli cultures while obtaining a high final yield in plasmid when advanced growth systems are applied controlling the cultivation conditions. Ramirez et al. [79] concluded in a study that the use of their engineered strain together with the enhanced growth system is a promising method for plasmid DNA production in shake flasks. This demonstrates once more that when exploiting bacteria as production factories in general, the cultivation conditions are [5] of great importance, and should be considered as an essential part during any optimization studies. \n\nFor protein production in yeasts the same challenges as in E. coli cultures apply. The application of an advanced growth systems in yeast cultivations has been successfully tested by Grimm et al. [5]. The growth and the ability to convert a certain substrate of twenty different yeast strains was compared in the study. In almost all cases the cell mass (measured as wet cell weight) and the substrate conversion (in %) was significantly improved compared to cultivations done in standard YEP medium. Potvin et al. [80] proposed the application of intelligent growth systems in Pichia pastoris cultivations. Recently, studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. Yuan et al. [81] produced the type 1 ribosome inactivating protein Saporin L3 from Saponaria officinalis (soapwort) leaves which is toxic for E. coli successfully in P. pastoris using the EnBase technology.",

            "text": "Yeasts, the single-celled eukaryotic fungal organisms, are commonly applied to production of recombinant proteins that are not be able to be expressed well in E.coli because of difficulties such as mis-folding or lack of glycosylation. The major advantages of yeast expression systems include; high yield, stable production, cost effectiveness, mammalian-like PTMs, proper folding of S-S rich proteins and high density growth. Also, yeasts have some considerable benefits compared to insect or mammalian cells. They are easier to handle, less expensive and are easily adaptable to fermentation processes. 56 The three most utilized yeast strains are Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) and Hansenula polymorpha (H. polymorpha). However, glycosylation by S. cerevisiae is often unacceptable for mammalian proteins because the O-linked oligosaccharides contain only mannose; furthermore, it may cause immunological reactions against the produced recombinant proteins in the body. For overcoming these problems, the methylotrophic yeasts can be used instead of S. cerevisiae for production of recombinant proteins. Methylotrophic yeasts are cost effective hosts and they can produces high levels of recombinant proteins with considerable stability. 62 Endostatin has two disulfide bonds in its structure that is essential to its folding and function. One of the best advantages of P. pastoris over E. coli is its ability to produce disulfide bonds of proteins. This means that in this situation where disulfides are important, E. coli might produce a misfolded protein, which is usually inactive or insoluble. Also, Pichia usually gives much better yields, compared to other expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or S2-cells from Drosophila melanogaster. 63 Additionally, production of recombinant proteins such as endostatin in P. pastoris is more economical. One of the most notable properties for expression systems is having strong and strictly adjustable promoter that methylotrophic yeasts have these advantages. 62",

The most widespread expression system is Escherichia coli with the advantage that it is relatively cheap and easy to handle and proteins are produced in large amounts. The disadvantage is that certain proteins are found in the form of inclusion bodies and need a refolding step, which can be critical for the functionality of the allergen. Few proteins cannot be properly expressed in E coli because they require correct disulfide bond formation and/or posttranslational modifications and therefore need to be expressed in eukaryotic cells. No matter which of the expression system from the ones mentioned above is chosen, careful design, construction, and sequencing of the expression vector is important. Regarding antibiotic resistance gene of the expression vectors, kanamycin resistance should be favored over ampicillin because of reports about severe hypersensitivity reactions to ampicillin. Subsequently, master cell bank derived from one single transformed clone should be established and frozen as glycerol stock. This master cell bank will be used for all further production lots, thus ensuring consistency of the end product. For product expression and fermentation, high-cell density cultivation based on a fed-batch protocol is most common, and high-performance cultivation may result in a cell density of more than 100 OD of E coli and more than 200 OD units for Pichia pastoris, both resulting in recombinant protein titers of up to 10 g/L of culture broth. \n\nOn expression, the cells are usually separated by continuous-flow centrifugation, followed by mechanical high-pressure homogenization. Expression and harvesting are referred as upstream processing. Proteins are subsequently purified by several chromatographic steps (eg, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, size-exclusion chromatography). In general, downstream processing (protein purification) is usually structured into the capture, intermediate purification, and polishing model.",

Optimisation of recombinant protein production remains problematic as many proteins are difficult to make, and process conditions must be optimised for each individual protein. An approach to accelerate process development is the use of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions, which can be used to rapidly and simply measure the quantity and folding state of the protein of interest. In this study, we used GFP fusions to optimise production of recombinant human protein tumour necrosis factor (rhTNF\u03b1) using a T7 expression system. Flow cytometry was used to measure fluorescence and cell viability on a single cell level to determine culture heterogeneity. Fluorescence measurements were found to be comparable to data generated by subcellular fractionation and SDS-PAGE, a far more time-intensive technique. We compared production of rhTNF\u03b1-GFP with that of GFP alone to determine the impact of rhTNF\u03b1 on expression levels. Optimised shakeflask conditions were then transferred to fed-batch high cell density bioreactor cultures. Finally, the expression of GFP from a paraBAD expression vector was compared to the T7 system. We highlight the utility of GFP fusions and flow cytometry for rapid process development.",

Recombinant Escherichia coli cells are the organism of choice for large scale production of a carrier protein because of its widely studied scientific aspects. In the present study, for proof of concept, the recombinant E. coli cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani media to check the expression of rCRM197. At 80L scale, it was observed that when recombinant E. coli cells were grown in a chemically defined media, it resulted in inconsistent growth and a long lag phase. When the defined media was supplemented with yeast extract, the lag phase of the culture was substantially reduced and the maximum growth of the culture was achieved. Protein expression was checked using SDS PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) and Western blot technique. The optimized media resulted in a robust fermentation process to achieve high cell density and maximum biomass for the production of recombinant protein.",

            "text": "Production of heterologous proteins has long been shown to exert a metabolic burden on the producing host cell (Bentley et al. 1990;Glick 1995). This phenomenon has been observed in all main classes of host organisms (bacteria, yeasts, mammalian cells), typically leading to a reduction of the maximum specific growth rate and of biomass yield. It is part of a stress reaction to protein overproduction (for a review see Mattanovich et al. (2004)). Yeasts are well established as host cells for production of recombinant proteins, and among them Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella sp.) is widely used today (Gasser et al. 2013). Decreased biomass production in protein producing P. pastoris strains has often been observed (e.g., (Dragosits et al. 2009;Heyland et al. 2010;Jorda et al. 2012). \n\nMetabolic burden has been attributed to the rerouting of metabolites (mainly nucleotides and amino acids) from cellular pathways to the recombinant product. Besides that, the extra demand of energy and reducing power has been discussed to be responsible for metabolic burden (Heyland et al. 2011). Similarly, Dragosits et al. (2009) observed a Justyna Nocon and Matthias Steiger contributed equally to this paper Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00253-016-7363-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\ndecreased metabolic flux to biomass formation while TCA cycle flux increased in a strain producing an antibody Fab fragment compared to a non-producing control strain, thus pointing at an increased energy demand of the producing strain. In recombinant Escherichia coli, the increase of ATP production by reversion of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction led to higher production of GFP (Kim et al. 2012). Flores et al. (2004) engineered the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of E. coli to alleviate the metabolic burden of recombinant protein overproduction.",

            "text": "To reach efficient tyrosinase production, cells with high growth rate, high maximum biomass and high level tyrosinase activity are desired. However, overproduction of a protein often hinders the growth of bacterial cells and vice versa [42]. Thus, it is plausible to let the cells grow to a high cell density, and then induce expression of the relevant gene so that the protein of interest will be produced. In this study, E. coli DH5\u03b1, JM109 and BLR were transformed with pMFvpt which contains the gene encoding the cytoplasmic full-length tyrosinase (53.5 kDa) of Verrucomicrobium spinosum [38]. The obtained recombinants were cultivated in shake flasks at 37\u00b0C and 150 rpm, and induced with 1 mM IPTG at the early exponential growth phase (OD 600 \u2248 0.6). The cultivations were continued for 24 h and samples were taken periodically for measurement of cell density and tyrosinase activity. The results are summarized in Table 1. Although the DH5\u03b1 recombinant exhibited the highest tyrosinase production, the growth rate was more than 2 fold lower than that obtained with two other tested hosts. Furthermore, the expression of the tyrosinase gene could not be controlled in recombinant DH5\u03b1 because DH5\u03b1 does not have the repressor protein LacI q and enables constitutive expression of tyrosinase gene from the T5 promoter / lac operator element in pMFvpt. BLR exhibited uncontrolled expression and very low activity of tyrosinase. By contrast, the JM109 recombinant showed controlled expression due to the presence of the LacI q repressor, even though the total tyrosinase production was lower than that in DH5\u03b1. Furthermore, the JM109 recombinant exhibited a high growth rate of 0.6 h -1 . In order to reach high cell density, high growth rate and controlled production of the relevant protein are desired. Thus, in this study JM109 recombinant was chosen for further investigations.",

Other modifications may include \u03b3 carboxylation of glutamic acid residues (Suttie, 1985;Kaufman et al., 1986a); hydroxylation of aspartic acid and asparagine residues (Stenflo, 1989); sulfation of tyrosine residues (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987); phosphorylation of proteins through cell receptor-protein interaction (Myers et al., 1994); fatty acid acylation (McIlhinney, 1990); and correct assembly of multimeric proteins. In contrast to what happens in mammalian cells, the production of intracellular recombinant proteins in E. coli leads to accumulation of the protein in reduced form, often as insoluble refractile bodies requiring subsequent denaturation and refolding. This unit will briefly review the stages involved in protein production in mammalian cells using the stable-expression approach as outlined in Figure 5.9.1. Discussion will include choice of cell type, transfection of the host cells, methods for selection and amplification of transformants, and growth of cells at appropriate scale for protein production. Since post-transcriptional modification and intracellular protein transportation are important features of recombinant-protein production in mammalian cells, some description of these mechanisms is included. are summarized in Table 5.9.1. The narrowing down of choices is largely due to the need for cell lines that: (1) are capable of continuous growth; (2) can be grown in suspension (in bioreactors); (3) have low risk of adventitious infection by potentially pathogenic viruses; (4) have genetic stability; and ( 5) can be readily characterized with respect to karyology, morphology, isoenzymes, and gene copy number.",

            "text": "Living cells have long been used as workhorse for conventional manufacturing of protein biopharmaceuticals in centralized, large-scale and single-product facilities [2,[46][47][48]. With the fast development in synthetic biology, new methods using rewired cells are emerging for portable and on-demand production of drugs for small patient populations or individuals. E. coli are commonly used microorganisms to produce heterologous proteins for therapeutic use, accounting for ~30% of biopharmaceuticals (particularly non-glycosylated proteins), due to their rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost effectiveness and simple scale-up process. The availability of various expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms and bioprocess technologies, make them very attractive for industrial applications. However, synthesis of recombinant proteins using bacterial hosts entails multiple steps including culturing, disruption of bacteria by physical or chemical means, and subsequent isolation and purification of the desired product. For industrial operations, these steps are usually carried out on a large scale; consequently, each step requires a sophisticated and delicate infrastructure to ensure efficiency and product quality. While critical for producing molecules in large amounts, this format is not flexible or economically suited for producing or characterizing diverse biologics when only a small amount is needed for each. In 2019, Dai et al. took advantage of recent developments in synthetic biology and stimulus-responsive biomaterials to integrate multiple steps of production, disruption and separation into a concise format to build a microbial swarmbot (MSB) platform (Fig. 3a) [49]. They first programmed the density-dependent autolysis of engineered bacteria by a genetic circuit, and encapsulated these bacteria into a micro-sized hydrogel capsules. When the local cell density inside the capsule was sufficiently high, autonomous partial lysis would occur and allow the cells to release their contents, including the protein product of interest. The bacterial growth changed the local environmental conditions (pH and ionic strength), driving the volume phase transition of the encapsulating material. Consequently, the released protein was transported from the interior to exterior with the shrinking of growth-sensitive capsules, while cells and large debris were trapped inside the capsules.",

Cheaper, easier, and faster protein expression can be performed in prokaryotic systems such as Escherichia coli, however, eukaryotic proteins can be toxic to bacteria and this bacterium cannot express high-molecular-weight proteins, in addition to not being the system of choice for proteins rich in S-S and proteins that require post-translational modifications, as they cannot carry out glycosylation and remove the S-S sequences [1,2]. Yeasts, unicellular eukaryotic fungal organisms, are often used to produce recombinant proteins that do not produce well in E. coli due to folding problems or the need for glycosylation. The advantages of yeast expression systems include: high throughput; stable production strains; durability; cost benefit; high density growth; high productivity; suitability for isotopically labeled protein production; rapid growth in chemically defined media being easily adapted to fermentation processes; mammalian cell-like product processing; proteins with molecular weight higher than 50 kDa can be produced; signal sequences can be removed; can handle S-S-rich proteins promoting disulfide bond formation; produce chaperones to aid in the folding of certain proteins; and can glycosylate proteins [1,3]. The two most used yeasts are Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, renamed as Komagataella pastoris or K. phaffii [1]. Methylotrophic yeasts can use methanol as the only source of carbon and energy. The enzyme alcohol oxidase (AOX; EC 1.1.3.13) catalyzes the first step in the methanol utilization pathway: the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The AOX is sequestered within the peroxisome along with catalase, which degrades hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water.",

The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction). Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction, cell lysis conditions etc. which play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form in vivo have been optimized. We have studied the effect of assistance of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we",

Although generally the fed-batch procedure has been extensively applied for successful production of many proteins, the challenge was to develop a strategy which is robust enough so that it also can be used without any sensors or further control. Despite this aim, in some of the cultures, pH and DO sensors were applied to evaluate the conditions provoked by the additives. As an example for a recombinant production system E. coli RB791 pAdh was used, which expresses a recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase very well in fed-batch cultivation and in Enbase \u00ae Flo deep-well plate cultures [18,21]. \n\nDue to the application of the pO 2 sensor, the k L a value of the system could be estimated during the growth phase of the microorganisms. The mean value at measured time points was 55 h -1 (standard deviation: 6.6). This is in the same order of k L a values described in literature for rocking-motion-type bioreactors as mentioned in the introduction of this report. The oxygen transfer rate in the rocking-motion-type bioreactor is approximately 6 fold lower compared to the k L a in stirred tank bioreactors of the same volume and appropriate settings for E. coli cultivation in our lab (data not shown). \n\nTo observe the growth behavior of this E. coli strain under non enhanced conditions and to get a starting point for further optimizations, control cultivations were performed in the EnBase \u00ae Flo cultivation medium without any boosting (see Fig. 4). The medium contained 1.5 U L - 1 of biocatalyst from the beginning. Only ammonium sulfate was added once (after 26 hours), trace elements and MgSO 4 twice (after 18 and 41 hours) during the course of the cultivation to obtain higher cell densities. The culture grew almost linearly and reached an OD 600 of 21 after 47 hours (Fig. 4A). Even after induction (after 26 hours), biomass growth did not decelerate markedly.",

            "text": "There are various systems for producing industrially or pharmaceutically useful recombinant protein in plants, and each system has strengths and weaknesses. We have reviewed many examples of production using each system. In the future, demands for plant-based biopharmaceuticals will increase. Most importantly, the economic feasibility of producing useful recombinant proteins will determine the viability of companies that have just started industrializing this process. Any successful strategy must make good use of the advantages of producing \"bio-betters\" by selecting suitable methodologies to overcome the low price of mass production in E. coli and the excellent efficacy of animal cells. Of the production systems discussed in this review, transient expression systems have been most frequently adopted by different companies, with 16 market-releasable items that are safe and environmentally friendly currently in indoor or outdoor trials [119]. Bioreactor-based cell culture systems, which can be rapidly scaled-up and are free of mammalian pathogens, have been adopted by traditional fermentation-based companies. Despite this, the situation concerning GM plants is still not always favorable and some major hurdles remain. The final goal, namely, the production of a plant-based vaccine in fresh plant materials that can be eaten, is yet to be achieved. Given market prices, the large capacity required, and the general understanding of plant biopharmaceuticals by the general population, it is difficult to challenge the dominance of conventional production platforms based on E.\n\ncoli, mammalian cells, and yeast. However, recent advances in plant molecular farming allow very large-scale, even multi-tonne scale, production of plant-based pharmaceuticals. The positive trend is that many researchers try to start a venture based on technology acquired from the laboratory. Thus, technologies from various fields will converge and continue to develop; eventually, clinical products produced using these systems will enter the market.",

            "title": "Optimized expression of Hfq protein increases Escherichia coli growth",
            "text": "The production of chemical substances and proteins from genetically engineered bacteria has been studied for decades for practical use [1], and metabolic engineering has proven the essential role of bacteria engineering and its practical usefulness in the industry [2][3][4]. For instance, recent advances in metabolic engineering make it possible to engineer bacteria or yeast cells for high and cost-efficient production of recombinant therapeutic proteins such as insulin and growth hormones [5][6][7] and biofuels such as alcohols, fatty acid methyl, and ethyl esters [8][9][10]. Regarding recombinant protein production, there have been several strategies to increase protein titers. High copy-number plasmids have been used to produce larger amounts of desired proteins [11,12], but high copy-number plasmids often place a metabolic burden on host cells, which eventually decreases cell growth, reduces plasmid stability [13], and consequently decreases protein productivity [14,15]. Optimization of promoter strength has been also used to obtain a high protein titer. Depending on the properties or activities of desired proteins, toxicity, e.g., transcriptional optimization often increases overall protein titers [16][17][18][19]. Recently, the increase in bacterial growth rate or cell density has gained great interest to achieve higher production of proteins [20]. Several strategies for improving the cell density of Escherichia coli are summarized in Table 1. \n\nIn this study, we developed an E. coli strain that had a higher growth rate by optimizing the expression level of Hfq protein. Hfq protein was originally discovered as a host factor for phage Q \u03b2 (Hfq) replication in E. coli [34]. This chaperone, Hfq protein, is an abundant 11 kDa protein that forms a hexameric ring, can be found in more than 50% of bacterial species [35], and present widely in proteobacteria and firmicutes [36,37]. There have been several studies indicating that Hfq promotes the ability of host cells to resist stresses such as oxidative stress and pH stress [38].",

Compared with these strains, E. coli has many advantages such as a clear genetic background, high convenience to be genetically modified, and good growth properties with low nutrient requirements [35]. Here, we tested our recombinant E. coli strain using high-density fermentation strategy. Based on the results obtained by the shake-flask cultivations, the finally engineered E. coli strain BL21\u0394fadD/pE-A1'tesA&pA-acc was cultured in a 5 L-scale laboratory fermentor. Cell density, residual glucose concentration and products accumulation were monitored over the course of fed-batch fermentation. Figure 4 shows the time profiles of cell density and production of HFAs during 24 h fed-batch fermentation. The bacteria grew very fast at the first 12 h post-induction to an OD 600 of approximate 70. FFAs and HFAs also accumulated rapidly in the culture broth.

            "text": "High-level recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli can lead to enhanced acetate secretion and growth inhibition, a phenomenon frequently described as \"metabolic burden.\" The main reason for the protein production associated metabolic burden has been attributed to drainage of precursors and energy away from host cell maintenance and growth towards recombinant gene/plasmid related functions. Enhanced acetate formation and the resultant growth inhibition is also observed when E. coli is growing under nutrient excess conditions, a phenomenon generally known as \"carbon overflow\" metabolism. For both phenomena, energetic constraints have been held responsible, primarily the differences in proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration and fermentation (Basan et al., 2015;Mori, Marinari, & De, 2019;Zeng & Yang, 2019a, 2019b). In this context, overproduction of \"useless\" proteins has been considered to amplify the problem of carbon overflow metabolism by reducing the fraction of the host cell proteome available for energy production and biomass synthesis. These considerations imply that cells producing recombinant proteins may experience shortages in energy and biomass precursors. Protein synthesis is, compared to the synthesis of the other cellular macromolecules, a more energy-demanding process (Kaleta, Sch\u00e4uble, Rinas, & Schuster, 2013;Stouthamer, 1973) in particular if energy requirements for protein foldingassociated purposes have to be taken into account (Corrales & Fersht, 1996;Sharma, De los, Christen, Lustig, & Goloubinoff, 2010;Szabo et al., 1994). Moreover, recombinant-protein producing cells require (deoxy)ribonucleotides for plasmid DNA synthesis and recombinant gene transcription as well as amino acids for the production of the recombinant protein potentially leading to a shortage of these precursors for host cell proliferation. \n\nThe most common E. coli-based expression system is the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter controlled gene expression combination.",

            "text": "The success of biopharmaceutical industries is driven by time and cost-effective manufacturing of target recombinant proteins. There is no uncertainty that the production of recombinant proteins in microbial expression systems has revolutionized the domains of biochemistry and biotechnology [1]. E. coli has been a workhorse for recombinant protein production for over four decades and offers various advantages over other expression hosts such as comparatively easier genetic manipulation, cost-effective production, rapid cell growth, and a simple fermentation process [2,3]. One of the critical drawbacks of using wild type E. coli as an expression host is its inability to carry out post-translational modifications such as disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. However, the CyDisCo system offers an attractive solution for the high-yield production of disulfide-bonded recombinant proteins [4]. While a wide range of disulfide-bonded recombinant proteins has been successfully produced using the CyDisCo system, including scFv and Fab antibody fragments [5,6], production of commercially relevant modified antibody formats such as Fc fusion proteins has not been reported. Fc fusion proteins are chimeric proteins composed of a biologically active peptide or receptor domain fused to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. Most of the molecules in this drug class have been produced using mammalian cell lines, while some are produced in E. coli in the form of insoluble aggregates that are subsequently refolded in vitro [7]. \n\nOne rationale behind choosing to investigate the cost-effective production of candidates from the drug class of Fc fusion proteins is the ongoing demand to enhance the capabilities of therapeutic peptides [8]. The pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic peptides such as low stability and fast renal clearance hamper their therapeutic application [9]. Grafting these peptides to the Fc region of an IgG offers many advantages such as decreased renal clearance owing to their increased size and the therapeutic activity being retained or even enhanced due to homodimerization which causes an increased avidity to the target (at least two peptides per molecule) [10].",

However, the focus of recombinant protein production is to achieve high titers, yields, and productivities in order to reduce the cost of protein production, because although recombinant protein production is now a well-established practice, large-scale production of proteins, particularly for low-cost applications, still remains economically challenging [1]. \n\nRecombinant protein production begins with the integration of recombinant DNA, often from a heterologous source, into the genome of the host organism under the control of protein expression elements. A DNA vector composed of various genetic elements such as the gene of interest, promoters, terminators, reporters, markers, and enhancers is transformed into the host cell using a variety of different transformation methods. Integration into the host cell genome can also be achieved using a variety of mechanisms such as CRISPR-mediated genome editing or random integration, and is largely influenced by the host cell type (bacterial, plant, yeast, cell culture systems) and species. The most used platforms include bacteria (Escherichia coli), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris), mammalian cells (CHO and HEK-293 cells), and baculovirus/insect cells (Sf9, Sf21) [2]. However, proteins with complex post-translational modifications cannot be produced in the highly productive, low-cost bacteria or yeast systems, and therefore, costly cell culture systems are typically employed. Due to their costs, cell cultures systems are typically only used to produce high-value products like biologics. Thus, there remains a gap in the available production systems for the production eukaryotic proteins for low-cost applications like industrial enzymes. \n\nMicroalgae are microorganisms widely distributed throughout natural environments. Due to the low cost of their cultivation (low energy inputs and simple inorganic media), they have garnered interest as a low-cost platform to produce recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "Proteins, which are made of one or more chains of amino acid residues, are tremendously diverse in both their structures and functions. Proteins perform a vast spectrum of structural, biochemical and molecular activities within organisms. Many of these biological functions of proteins also have important medical, industrial and scientific applications. By 2018, 374 protein-based pharmaceutical products had gained a license in the United States and European Union, which accounts for about a third of all pharmaceuticals in development [1]. These protein-based pharmaceutical products include monoclonal antibodies, hormones, enzymes, vaccines, clotting and growth factors. Recombinant proteins including enzymes have also been extensively used in production of textiles and chemicals and in processing of food and feed. Other recombinant proteins have been widely used in diagnostics and scientific research. The global protein expression market size was US$1.65 billion in 2017 and was projected to increase at more than 10% annually to reach US$6.47 billion by 2030 [2,3]. \n\nMost recombinant proteins are currently produced in bacteria (mainly Escherichia coli) and mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells). Bacterial cells are easy and cheap to culture but lack the capacity to perform certain post-translational modifications. As a result, many complex proteins particularly those therapeutic antibodies and vaccines are usually produced in mammalian cells [2,3]. With the development of plant transformation in early 1980s [4,5], the potential to produce recombinant proteins in plants has also been extensively explored. Plants and plant cells have a number of advantages over bacterial and mammalian platforms for production of recombinant proteins including therapeutic proteins [6]. These advantages include the low cost and relatively high speed of recombinant protein production at a large scale in plants and plant cells [7,8]. As eukaryotic organisms, plants can carry out many of the post-translational modifications for production of complex proteins but do not require animal derived reagents (serum-free) for cultivation [9]. Plants also lack harmful or toxic substances present in bacteria and many therapeutic proteins and injectable and edible vaccines do not require extensive purification when produced in plants [9][10][11].",

However, their physiological properties limit their use for the production of proteins in their native form, especially polypeptides that are subjected to major post-translational modifications. Proteins that rely on disulfide bridges for their stability are difficult to produce in Escherichia coli. The bacterium offers the least costly, simplest, and fastest method for protein production. However, it is difficult to produce proteins with a very large size. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most commonly used yeast species for protein production. At a low expense, yeasts can offer high protein yields, generate proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, extract signal sequences, and glycosylate proteins. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species maintain reducing conditions in the cytoplasm. Hence, the formation of disulfide bonds is inhibited. These bonds are formed in eukaryotic cells during the export cycle, under the oxidizing conditions of the endoplasmic reticulum. Bacteria do not have an advanced subcellular space, but in the oxidizing periplasm, they exhibit both export systems and enzymatic activities directed at the formation and quality of disulfide bonds. Here, we discuss current techniques used to target eukaryotic and prokaryotic species for the generation of correctly folded proteins with disulfide bonds.",

            "text": "optosis (13)(14)(15). Furthermore, in recent studies, it has been demonstrated that recombinant C-PC/\u03b2 is also an inhibitor of cell proliferation and an inducer of cancer cell apoptosis by promoting cytoskeleton depolymerization and activating caspase activities, which are associated with the extrinsic cell death pathway (16).\n\nThe function of the \u03b2-subunit is different from that of the whole C-PC protein and it seems that the C-PC\u03b2 may be more effective in inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis induction than \u03b1/\u03b2C-PC. The C-PC/\u03b2 also shows a greater effect on metastatic cancer cells compared to non-metastatic cancer cells. This property may indicate the potential application of C-PC/\u03b2 as a cancer prevention and/or treatment agent and its use for preventing tumor metastasis (16). Expression of C-PC in bacteria reduces the cost and time for protein production, and the recombinant protein could be further developed to obtain a more efficient protein for therapeutic purposes. Among the systems available for heterologous protein production, Escherichia coli expression systems have been preferred as an option for producing many recombinant proteins (17)(18)(19)(20). Escherichia coli facilitates protein expression by its relatively simple, inexpensive and fast high-density cultivation, and its well-known genetics and large number of compatible tools available for biotechnology (21). In this study, E. coli could be an appropriate system for production of C-PC/\u03b2, since C-PC/\u03b2 can be expressed and purified as soluble recombinant protein in E. coli (16). Furthermore high codon usage similarity exists between E. coli and S. platensis (data not shown here), thus codon optimization in E. coli expression system is not required. Therefore, it is attractive to clone and express cpcB gene to generate and purify recombinant proteins in large quantities for pharmaceutical and biomedical purposes.",

This bacterium is suitable for protein recombinant host since it has rapid growth, high expression rate, and well-known genome. Various proteins have been produced using E. coli expression systems, with therapeutic protein for medical application being the most notably produced. Apart from that, our group succeeded in producing beta galactosidase from a wild type E. coli strain B130. Furthermore, recombinant human serum albumin was successfully produced using E. coli strains BL21 (DE3).

            "text": "E. coli remains the most widely used system for recombinant protein expression due to its numerous advantages over other expression systems such as yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems. The key benefits of using E. coli include its low cost, ease of use, and ability to scale production efficiently, making it the preferred host for many researchers. [14] urthermore, the flexibility of E. coli in accommodating various expression conditions allows for fine-tuning protein production to optimize yield and solubility, which are critical for downstream applications. Recent studies have demonstrated that altering expression parameters, such as temperature, induction time, and inducer concentration, can significantly enhance production efficiency and solubility of target proteins. [15] ur comprehensive search on the database, which catalogued E. coli-expressed recombinant proteins, included entries corresponding to 17 317 unique UniProt IDs sourced from 19 799 research articles. This extensive dataset provides valuable insight into the commonly used induction conditions across a wide array of proteins. For instance, in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), we show that the most frequently used induction temperatures are 18, 20, and 16 \u00b0C, which accounted for 19.1%, 15.6%, and 13.6% of cases, respectively. The induction times are clustered predominantly around two ranges: 12-16 h (69.0%) and 3-6 h (14.3%), with isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentrations commonly set to 1 millimolar or 0.5 millimolar. Additionally, as shown in Figure 5, specific conditions are favored to maximize the expression of proteins with distinct annotations. For example, proteins associated with \"disulfide bond,\" \"protease\", and \"DNA-binding\" annotations tend to be expressed under shorter induction times (2-8 h) and higher temperatures (28-37 \u00b0C), whereas those related to the \"cytoskeleton\", \"cell cycle\", and \"nucleus\" are less commonly expressed under shorter induction times. Moreover, proteins that bind iron or whose functions are iron-dependent are more frequently expressed at 28 \u00b0C for 24 h.",

            "text": "High-Cell-Density Cultivations show a huge potential to produce recombinant proteins to amounts greatly exceeding the availability in natural resources. An interesting example of a recombinant protein is an L-arabinose isomerase, which is able to convert D-galactose to the low-caloric and low-glycaemic bulk sweetener D-tagatose. Within this study, the L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus was expressed intracellularly in Escherichia coli. The cultivation medium contained glucose, yeast extract and various macro- and micronutrients. The effect of air flow rate on E. coli growth and expression of L-arabinose isomerase was studied. After 52 hours, an Optical Density and Dry Cell Weight of 154 \u00b1 4 and 54.8 \u00b1 1.3 g L-1 were reached, respectively by regulating the air flow rate between 0.2 and 30 L min-1. A corresponding L-arabinose isomerase activity of 6.99 \u00b1 0.46 U mL-1 was reached. A drawback of High-Cell-Density Cultivation is the production of the by-product acetic acid which may inhibit growth. However, the acetic acid concentration was maintained as low as possible during fermentation to avoid inhibitory effects inherent to this compound. With the L-arabinose isomerase produced, a conversion percentage of 37.1 \u00b1 1.5% was achieved, corresponding to 94.9 \u00b1 3.7 g L-1 D-tagatose. Thus, the implementation of a High-Cell- Density Cultivation led to an efficient expression of the L-arabinose isomerase enzyme and D-tagatose production. Also the storage stability of the cells was investigated during several months at 4\u00b0C. A stable L-arabinose isomerase enzyme was noticed during at least 8 months storage at 4\u00b0C.",

E. coli cells have been well characterized, have relatively simple genetics and grow rapidly, making them the preferred hosts for recombinant protein production for both biochemical and structural studies [35][36][37][38][39]. Specific properties of the M3 protein, including its relatively small size, good solubility and absence of posttranslational modifications, allowed us to produce recombinant, full-length M3 protein from both MHV-68 and MHV-72 in E. coli cells [40]. \n\nEvaluation of the MHV-68 M3 protein affinity for CCL5, CXCL8 and CCL3 showed that binding to CCL5 is approximately 20 and 100-times stronger than its binding to CXCL8 and CCL3, respectively. An additional study on the MHV-72 M3 protein prepared in an E. coli system showed that its unique mutation reduces its binding to all chemokines tested, including CCL5, CXCL8 and CCL3, with the strongest impact on CCL3 binding [41]. Unfortunately, in both studies the majority of the expressed heterologous protein appeared in E. coli inclusion bodies, and approximately half of the recombinant protein produced formed insoluble aggregates. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated the effect of a deletion of the signal peptide (the first 24 residues) in recombinant MHV-68 M3 protein on its chemokine binding properties. To prepare recombinant proteins with and without signal peptide, we used a baculovirus-mediated insect cell expression system and compared both M3del and M3, focusing on their binding to CCL5 and CXCL8.",

            "text": "BackgroundThe specific productivity of cultivation processes can be optimized, amongst others, by using genetic engineering of strains, choice of suitable host/vector systems or process optimization (e.g. choosing the right induction time). A further possibility is to reduce biomass buildup in favor of an enhanced product formation, e.g. by limiting secondary substrates in the medium, such as phosphate. However, with conventional techniques (e.g. small scale cultivations in shake flasks), it is very tedious to establish optimal conditions for cell growth and protein expression, as the start of protein expression (induction time) and the degree of phosphate limitation have to be determined in numerous concerted, manually conducted experiments.ResultsWe investigated the effect of different induction times and a concurrent phosphate limitation on the specific productivity of the T7 expression system E.coli BL21(DE3) pRhotHi-2-EcFbFP, which produces the model fluorescence protein EcFbFP upon induction. Therefore, specific online-monitoring tools for small scale cultivations (RAMOS, BioLector) as well as a novel cultivation platform (Robo-Lector) were used for rapid process optimization. The RAMOS system monitored the oxygen transfer rate in shake flasks, whereas the BioLector device allowed to monitor microbial growth and the production of EcFbFP in microtiter plates. The Robo-Lector is a combination of a BioLector and a pipetting robot and can conduct high-throughput experiments fully automated. By using these tools, it was possible to determine the optimal induction time and to increase the specific productivity for EcFbFP from 22% (for unlimited conditions) to 31% of total protein content of the E.coli cells via a phosphate limitation.ConclusionsThe results revealed that a phosphate limitation at the right induction time was suitable to redirect the available cellular resources during cultivation to protein expression rather than in biomass production. To our knowledge, such an effect was shown for the first time for an IPTG-inducible expression system. Finally, this finding and the utilization of the introduced high-throughput experimentation approach could help to find new targets to further enhance the production capacity of recombinant E.coli-strains.",

            "text": "Many approaches were associated with the efficient production of recombinant proteins. The composition of the media is one of the major attributes that affects the economics of cultivation processes and may have a significant impact on production cost and quality. It is generally known that complex media are more favourable for the growth of microorganisms, as their components are directly utilizable in the metabolic pathways, thus saving energy for precursor formation [1]. The difference between complex and defined media at the production level is often notable [2][3][4][5]. \n\nFor example, in the case of E. coli, Uderwood et al. [6] demonstrated that the growth rates of genetically engineered strains producing pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase are substantially reduced in a defined medium compared to a complex medium. In order to achieve the efficient production and purification of recombinant cysteine proteinase, Aoki et al. [7] firstly cultivated P. pastoris in a complex medium to quickly obtain the sufficient amount of biomass and then transferred it to the defined medium. \n\nOn the other hand, the overexpression of recombinant proteins directly reduces cell growth by the \"protein burden\" [8]. The burden which was studied on recombinant strains of S. cerevisiae expressing T. reesei xylanase, was much higher than expected from the expression level. The supplementation of media (for example with amino acids or succinate) can partially solve the problem, [9]. This observation supports the theory about the demand for amino acids of overproducing recombinant yeast strains [10]. A similar observation was obtained by the study of Pichia stipites by G\u00f6rgens et al. [9]. In this case, the addition of some amino acids to the media improved the production level of xylanase under the control of an oxygen regulated promoter. \n\nZhang et al. [11] demonstrated that the nitrogen source can play an essential role in the production of heterologous proteins and that the composition of the yeast extract, as a nitrogen source, significantly affects recombinant protein production.",

            "text": "Recently, denosumab was produced from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Although mammalian cells show beneficial effects in recombinant therapeutic protein production, such as producing properly folded and posttranslationally modified proteins (PTMs; Khan, 2013), this process has a high production cost, a complicated technology, limited scalability, and the possibility of contaminating the product with human and animal pathogens (Yin et al., 2007;Leuzinger et al., 2013). \n\nThere are many protein expression systems available, such as mammalian cells, yeast, and bacteria, to produce recombinant therapeutic proteins. There are some drawbacks to each system. For instance, the bacterial expression system is a commonly used platform for producing recombinant proteins. The major drawback associated with the prokaryotic system is the lack of appropriate PTMs that may result in incorrect protein folding (Balamurugan et al., 2006). In contrast, mammalian cells have many beneficial aspects, but the production cost is high (Yin et al., 2007;Leuzinger et al., 2013). For yeast systems, there are many advantages, such as a rapid growth rate, the requirement for a simple growth medium, and the ability to perform PTMs. However, this system has some limitations, such as hyperglycosylation and complicated downstream processes (Gomes et al., 2016). For insect cell systems, there is a possibility of contamination with mammalian viruses, and also, proteases in the host cell might cause protein degradation (Hejnaes and Ransohoff, 2018). \n\nTo overcome these limitations, a plant-based production system is an alternative platform for recombinant therapeutic protein production. Plant expression platforms have several advantages over traditional expression platforms.",

            "text": "Recombinant biotherapeutic molecules, such as singledomain antibody fragments (dAbs), antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), and single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are produced in Escherichia coli due to its well-known physiology and genetics. Factors, such as lack of glycosylation, easier production, high expression levels, high cell densities, and low production costs compared to other available expression platforms contribute to popularity of the E. coli platform. \n\nThe last few decades have witnessed significant advancements in cloning strategies, expression, and purification, thereby resulting in improved production of useful antibody-like fragments utilizing E. coli expression system. [1,2] he production process is typically quite simple. The desired gene of interest is cloned into a suitable expression vector, which is further transformed into choice of host, cultivated and induced, and protein is extracted and purified. Post purification, the protein is further characterized for structure and function. [3] However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

This article highlights the benefits of using yeast, especially for more challenging targets such as membrane proteins. On account of the wide range of molecular, genetic, and microbiological tools available, use of the well-studied model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provides many opportunities to optimize the functional yields of a target protein. Despite this wealth of resources, it is surprisingly under-used. In contrast, Pichia pastoris, a relative new-comer as a host organism, is already becoming a popular choice, particularly because of the ease with which high biomass (and hence recombinant protein) yields can be achieved. In the last few years, advances have been made in understanding how a yeast cell responds to the stress of producing a recombinant protein and how this information can be used to identify improved host strains in order to increase functional yields. Given these advantages, and their industrial importance in the production of biopharmaceuticals, I argue that S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris should be considered at an early stage in any serious strategy to produce proteins.",

First, we show that performing E. coli growth in auto-inducible medium (ZYM-5052) results in a comparable protein expression/solubility profile to that obtained when growing cells in classical Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Second, we show that the transformation mix can be used directly to inoculate a culture, saving time and circumventing the error-prone step of colony picking, without impairing cell growth and the protein expression/solubility profile. Thus, we show that a basic, but nevertheless essential, step of a protein production pipeline, E. coli cultivation, can be simplified to a single event that is fully compatible with complete automation.",

            "text": "Since the last century, the emergence of recombinant protein (RP) expression systems has revolutionized biotechnology. Excitingly, with the advancement of biotechnology, the yield of RPs has increased from the gram to the kilogram scale, and the range of applications has expanded from traditional food and chemical industries to biopharmaceuticals [1,2]. For example, it is projected that the industrial enzyme market will grow from USD 6.6 billion in 2021 to USD 9.1 billion by 2026 [3], illustrating the enormous market value and growth potential of RPs. Similarly, a variety of protein drugs have been successfully marketed, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), recombinant vaccines, and hormones, demonstrating that RPs already play a significant role in the biopharmaceutical field [4].\n\nDue to its inexpensive fermentation requirements, rapid proliferation ability and stable high-level expression, Escherichia coli (hereafter E. coli) has become the mainstay of RP expression among prokaryotic expression hosts [5]. As early as the 1970s, E. coli was applied in the production of clinical drugs, such as the hormones somatostatin [6] and insulin [7], which were commercialized early on. As a gold standard for expressing RPs, E. coli BL21(DE3) and the pET expression system are widely used in research and commercial production. This is primarily attributed to the T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) from \u03bb prophage in the genome of BL21(DE3), which can specifically recognize the T7 promoter (P T7 ) on the pET plasmid and transcribe at eightfold the speed of the E. coli native RNAP [8,9]. In recent years, several BL21(DE3)-derived strains have been widely used to produce various types of RPs, including C41/C43(DE3) (for the production of membrane proteins) [10], BL21(DE3)-pLysS (for reduction of T7 RNAP expression intensity) [11], BL21Star(DE3) (for improvement of mRNA stability) [12], and SixPack (for cod",

            "text": "Most recombinant expression systems employed in structural biology pipelines depend upon strong, inducible promoters to drive high rates of mRNA synthesis. For example, the strong S. cerevisiae promoter, P GAL1 , is induced with galactose while P AOX1 (a very strong P. pastoris promoter) is induced with methanol [5]. In choosing a strong promoter, the idea is that transcription should not be rate limiting. However, high mRNA synthesis rates may be countered by high rates of mRNA degradation [19]. Moreover, evidence from prokaryotic expression systems suggests that acquired mutations that lower promoter efficiency lead to improved functional yields of membrane proteins for some, but not all, targets [20]. In a separate study, a series of E. coli strains that had been evolved to improve their yield characteristics were found to have a mutation in the hns gene, which has a role in transcriptional silencing [21]. Together, these results support an emerging view that a suitable balance between mRNA and protein synthesis rates is desirable, although how this might be achieved in practice is not yet understood; one possibility might be a system based on slow, constitutive expression [22]. \n\nIt has been proposed that the ideal inducible system would completely uncouple cell growth from recombinant synthesis, which requires the host cell to remain metabolically capable of transcription and translation in a growth-arrested state. In this scenario, all metabolic fluxes would be diverted to the production of recombinant protein [23]. While this approach is yet to be demonstrated for membrane protein production in yeast cells, soluble chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was produced to more than 40% of total cell protein in E. coli [24] suggesting that this may be a strategy worth exploring in yeast. Indeed, growth rates often (but not always) decline dramatically upon induction of yeast cultures, in part achieving this state. \n\nWhen wild-type P. pastoris cells were cultured in methanol, it was found that a higher proportion of the total mRNA pool was c https://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/ppicz_man.pdf;",

The market for biopharmaceuticals is growing faster than the pharmaceuticals market as a whole, and a recent projection suggested the value of this segment could reach $US 278.2 billion by 2020 (PMR, 2015). There are more than 200 approved biopharmaceuticals on the market today and many more in the clinical pipeline (Walsh, 2014). Currently, most biologics are produced in microbes or mammalian cells growing in fermenters. Microbes are simple and inexpensive but often fail to produce complex proteins or those requiring specific post-translational modifications, whereas mammalian cells can achieve these folding and modification tasks with aplomb but only at a much higher cost. Both systems also have the potential for undesirable contaminants-endotoxins in the case of bacteria, and viruses or other pathogens in the case of mammalian cells. The extra steps required during downstream processing to remove these contaminants can increase production costs even further (BOX 1). \n\nThe choice of expression hosts has more recently expanded to include plants because they offer unique features compared to the current dominant production systems (Stoger et al., 2014;Ma et al., 2015). The production of recombinant proteins in plants, where the protein itself is the BOX 1 | COMPARISON OF MAJOR PRODUCTION PLATFORMS Industry platforms for the production of recombinant proteins are based mainly on microbes and mammalian cells. The major microbial system is the bacterium Escherichia coli which was the first species used to produce a recombinant human protein (somatostatin in 1977(somatostatin in , Itakura et al., 1977) ) and the first to be used for the production of a commercial therapeutic protein (recombinant human insulin, approved in 1982 and marketed by Eli Lilly & Co. under license from Genentech). Many simple and unmodified proteins are produced commercially in E. coli but more complex proteins are difficult to fold unless targeted to the periplasm and this is not a scalable process (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004;Choi and Lee, 2004).",

            "text": "Identification of high producer colons is a milestone for production of high amount of recombinant proteins at a reasonable cost. Therefore, rapid screening and expression optimization at the shortest time with the lowest cost are essential in the production of recombinant proteins, especially at an industrial scale (Hertzberg et al. 2000;Stephens et al. 2002;Vincentelli et al. 2011). \n\nAmong prokaryotic hosts, Escherichia coli (E. coli)based expression systems have gained the most interest for the production of recombinant non-glycosylated proteins due to their high expression level, simplicity, and low cost (Akbarzadeh et al. 2015;Huang et al. 2012). However, measurement of the expression using routine or traditional techniques including SDS-PAGE, immunoblot analysis, and biological activity assays is time-consuming and labor-intensive (Hui et al. 2018). In a study by Huietal et al., an indirect expression of target protein in E. coli was monitored based on a mCherry reporter. The reporter gene was inserted in the downstream of target protein ORF (Open Reading Frame). Therefore, the expression of the target gene was positively correlated to the expression of mCherry reporter. The method relied on an indirect and quantitative determination of recombinant expression level by measuring the fluorescent intensity of mCherry during the fermentation (Hui et al. 2018). In another approach, a microfluidics platform was used to optimize indirectly the protein expressions in the cells encapsulated with the biocompatible gel beads. In this platform, the encapsulated cells (bacteria and yeast) were fluorescently labeled to monitor and isolate the high-expressing clones using flow cytometry (Napiorkowska et al. 2021). \n\nRecently, we developed a dicistronic autoinducible expression system, called SILEX (Self Inducible Expression System), to facilitate the screening of highexpressing clones using fluorometry. This autoinducible system was first introduced in 2016 and has advantages over other previous self-inducible systems (Briand et al. 2016).",

Escherichia coli is the most common bacterium used for the expression of recombinant proteins, since engineered strains are well known and there are several molecular tools set up to work with this bacterium (69). Alternatively, high recombinant protein yields can be obtained using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris or some filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus awamori, Chrysosporium lucknowense, and Acremonium chrysogenum) (70).\n\nTo date, S. aureus endolysins have been purified mostly from E. coli, although it would be possible to assess other systems for their expression; an example is chloroplasts, which have the advantages that they lack endotoxins and have a low cultivation cost. Indeed, the endolysins cpl-1 and Pal, specific to Streptococcus pneumoniae, were successfully expressed in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (71). Moreover, a platform for expressing an endolysin against Propionibacterium acnes in cyanobacteria has recently been submitted for a patent (European patent application WO 2016130024). The main advantages of microalgae are low cost, easy upscaling, and the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of several species. Similarly, expression of recombinant proteins in plants is also a feasible alternative (72).\n\nAn important issue regarding proteins intended for therapeutic applications is the purification degree. Proteins must be highly purified, especially those to be administered parenterally. Suspensions of these proteins have to be sterile products obtained after a high number of phases, including centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and chromatographic steps, followed by sterilization by filtration and ultrafiltration. All these processes must be performed in clean areas (73)",

However, ectopic MazF production non-uniformly alters growth rates of bacterial cells [9]. Bacterial population heterogeneity is typically unfavorable in biotechnological processes it reduces the yield of recombinant protein production, and causes process instability especially during large-scale cultivation [27]. Inducing mazF expression at lower levels or shorter periods of time has a lesser impact on the population heterogeneity [9,28,29]. Furthermore, one of the most widely used hosts for recombinant protein production, E. coli BL21(DE3) [10,12,13], contains mazEF locus 100% identical to the mazEF locus of the here studied K-12 strain (see \"Methods\"). Therefore, a genetically engineered host E. coli strain with deleted mazEF locus could be employed in biotechnological setups, as the presence of the native mazEF locus has been shown to be the main source of population heterogeneity during ectopic mazF overexpression [9].",

            "text": "BackgroundSegregation of expression plasmids leads to loss of recombinant DNA from transformed bacterial cells due to the irregular distribution of plasmids between the daughter cells during cell division. Under non-selective conditions this segregational instability results in a heterogeneous population of cells, where the non-productive plasmid-free cells overgrow the plasmid-bearing cells thus decreasing the yield of recombinant protein. Amongst the factors affecting segregational plasmid instability are: the plasmid design, plasmid copy-number, host cell genotype, fermentation conditions etc. This study aims to investigate the influence of transcription and translation on the segregation of recombinant plasmids designed for constitutive gene expression in Escherichia coli LE392 at glucose-limited continuous cultivation. To this end a series of pBR322-based plasmids carrying a synthetic human interferon-gamma (hIFN\u03b3) gene placed under the control of different regulatory elements (promoter and ribosome-binding sites) were used as a model.ResultsBacterial growth and product formation kinetics of transformed E. coli LE392 cells cultivated continuously were described by a structured kinetic model proposed by Lee et al. (1985). The obtained results demonstrated that both transcription and translation efficiency strongly affected plasmid segregation. The segregation of plasmid having a deleted promoter did not exceed 5% after 190 h of cultivation. The observed high plasmid stability was not related with an increase in the plasmid copy-number. A reverse correlation between the yield of recombinant protein (as modulated by using different ribosome binding sites) and segregational plasmid stability (determined by the above model) was also observed.ConclusionsSwitching-off transcription of the hIFN\u03b3 gene has a stabilising effect on ColE1-like plasmids against segregation, which is not associated with an increase in the plasmid copy-number. The increased constitutive gene expression has a negative effect on segregational plasmid stability. A kinetic model proposed by Lee et al.

Bioprocessing involves the growth of selected cells in fermentation tanks/bioreactors under controlled conditions optimal for cell growth and protein expression. Eukaryotic cell lines (CHO cells, human cells, insect cells), eukaryotic microbial cells, e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) and prokaryotic cells, e.g., Escherichia coli have become invaluable expression systems for the production of many recombinant proteins [31]. Prokaryotic systems and eukaryotic yeast and fungal systems have many advantages, including ease of GM, ease of scale-up, rapid growth rate and cheap growth requirements. Mammalian cell lines, however, are more expensive to culture and are prone to microbial contamination, particularly viral contamination [32]. Proteins produced by mammalian cells are more accurately folded and subject to post-translational modifications (PTMs), which are absent in prokaryotic systems, where bacterial toxins also represent an issue [33]. PTM involves any process which alters protein composition and includes the irreversible or reversible addition of a chemical group, e.g., phosphate, carbohydrates (glycosylation) or polypeptides (ubiquitylation); this is related to the biological activity of the protein [34]. PTMs important for vaccine development include glycosylation, acetylation, sulfation, methylation, amidation, SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, lipidation, formylation and phosphorylation [35]. PTMs occurs in eukaryotic cell organelles including the nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, which are absent in prokaryotic cells [36].",

(1989) [132].\n\nThe first E. coli isolate was deposited in the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC, UK) in 1920.Later on, Cohen et al.

            "text": "However, proteins with consecutive disulfide bonds such as Fab's generally do not rely on DsbC and dsbC deletion has indeed been reported not to affect human Fab activity or yield when produced in E. coli. 51 Additionally, supplementation of 10 mM glutathione which is described to aid reshuffling of disulfides and thereby improve titers of recombinant, disulfide bond-containing proteins 52 led to decreased instead of increased Fab yields in both fed-batch-like microtiter and lab-scale fedbatch cultivations in our hands (data not shown). The effect on cell growth was not consistent and therefore not conclusive. Since the preliminary experiments did not show the anticipated improvements (as described by Kumar et al. 53 ), we focused on other strategies to improve Fab production, even though the underlying mechanisms would be worth further investigation. \n\nCampani et al. described that the metabolic burden exerted by recombinant protein production can impact qO 2 . 54 However, in our case, constant qO 2 during cultivation of the GFP-producing strains demonstrated that high-level expression of a recombinant protein and consequently increased ATP demand alone was not sufficient to increase qO 2 . Therefore, qO 2 depended solely on the growth rate and the nature of the used carbon source in both GFP-producing strains. Furthermore, for periplasmic expression SecA-mediated, ATP-and PMF-driven translocation of the recombinant proteins across the IM is necessary. 55 In contrast to cytosolic GFPmut3.1, expression of sfGFP and Fab's required translocation and hence additional ATP, which could have influenced qO 2 . Nevertheless, expression of periplasmic sfGFP did not cause an increase in qO 2 ; hence, energy consumption by translocation did not seem to have an impact on qO 2 . \n\nSince rather high levels of cell lysis were occurring, starting at approx. 11 h of feed with up to 66% of the product found extracellularly at the end of the process (Figure S1), cellular components in the culture broth might also have influenced qO 2 .",

            "text": "B acterial expression system has been used for research and commercial based production of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. Bacterial strain, E. coli has been used to produce biopharmaceutical products such as insulin, interferon, human growth factors and other recombinant proteins (Tripathi, 2016). Bacterial strain E. coli offers different advantages, such as easy to grow, high growth rate and cheap media demands. Moreover, its cellular components and genetics are well studied, which make it a host, that can bear fruitful genetic manipulations for expression of recombinant proteins (Joseph et al., 2015;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009;Tripathi, 2016). However, in spite of all these advantages, protein production in bacterial expression system, has never been a straight forward method. Certain disadvantages such as lack of post-translational modifications, formation of inclusion bodies, protein toxicity etc. may result in production of proteins either with improper structure and function or with no or very low yield (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different methodologies have been developed to target those factors that might be responsible for the problem of low yield in bacterial expression system. Briefly, these methodologies can be broadly classified as (i) those dealing with optimization of bioprocessing and culture conditions and (ii) those that deal at molecular level for enhancement of protein production, such as strain engineering, increased plasmid number, codon optimization and genetic manipulations of certain genetic elements. \n\nOptimization of bioprocessing and culturing conditions include several strategies. For enhanced production of recombinant proteins, usually cultures with high cell densities are preferred in batch and fed-batch fermentation processes. Cultures can either be induced or grown in auto-induction media for enhanced production of recombinant proteins in a regulated way (Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). Different media compositions, have been studied and shown to affect the protein expression level.",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins is of major interest for basic and applied research. There are several well-established systems in use for this purpose, e.g. Escherichia coli, yeast, mammalian cells and plant cells. Among these systems, plant cell factories have many advantages. Large quantities of plants can be grown easily at low cost, and when compared to mammalian cell cultures, there is no risk of contamination with retroviruses. Plant cells have an endomembrane system and secretory pathway similar to mammalian cells which allows post-translational modification of recombinant proteins (Pogue et al. 2010;Popescu et al. 2007). However, plants have the limitation that it usually takes a long time to produce stable transformed transgenic plants as compared to other expression systems, but this problem can be solved by transient expression methods. Transient expression in plant leaves enables the small-to medium-scale production of recombinant proteins at a timescale that is comparable to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. The preferred host plant for transient expression is Nicotiana benthamiana (Conley et al. 2011;Goodin et al. 2008;Sheludko et al. 2007). It is very susceptible to plant viruses, particularly due to a defective form of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase found in its genome (Yang et al. 2004). This viral susceptibility allows external viral replicases to replicate the delivered genes. The combination of ease of infection with bacterial and viral components and a long history of experimental use have made N. benthamiana a common laboratory host for the expression of recombinant proteins. This expression platform is based on leaves, and it significantly reduces the potential for gene leakage into the environment through pollen or seed dispersal. Furthermore, N. benthamiana is a non-food, non-feed crop, which minimizes the risk of recombinant proteins entering the food chain (Rymerson et al. 2002;Twyman et al. 2003). It has, for instance, been used to produce the haemagglutinin antigen from avian influenza virus A (Kanagarajan et al. 2012) and for the production of monoclonal antibodies (Castilho et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins is of major interest for basic and applied research. There are several well-established systems in use for this purpose, e.g. Escherichia coli, yeast, mammalian cells and plant cells. Among these systems, plant cell factories have many advantages. Large quantities of plants can be grown easily at low cost, and when compared to mammalian cell cultures, there is no risk of contamination with retroviruses. Plant cells have an endomembrane system and secretory pathway similar to mammalian cells which allows post-translational modification of recombinant proteins (Pogue et al. 2010;Popescu et al. 2007). However, plants have the limitation that it usually takes a long time to produce stable transformed transgenic plants as compared to other expression systems, but this problem can be solved by transient expression methods. Transient expression in plant leaves enables the small-to medium-scale production of recombinant proteins at a timescale that is comparable to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. The preferred host plant for transient expression is Nicotiana benthamiana (Conley et al. 2011;Goodin et al. 2008;Sheludko et al. 2007). It is very susceptible to plant viruses, particularly due to a defective form of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase found in its genome (Yang et al. 2004). This viral susceptibility allows external viral replicases to replicate the delivered genes. The combination of ease of infection with bacterial and viral components and a long history of experimental use have made N. benthamiana a common laboratory host for the expression of recombinant proteins. This expression platform is based on leaves, and it significantly reduces the potential for gene leakage into the environment through pollen or seed dispersal. Furthermore, N. benthamiana is a non-food, non-feed crop, which minimizes the risk of recombinant proteins entering the food chain (Rymerson et al. 2002;Twyman et al. 2003). It has, for instance, been used to produce the haemagglutinin antigen from avian influenza virus A (Kanagarajan et al. 2012) and for the production of monoclonal antibodies (Castilho et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1]. However, it is a common problem for recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and/or periplasm upon gene over-expression in E. coli [2,3]. This complex phenomenon has many contributing factors: insolubility of the product at the concentrations being produced, inability to fold correctly in the bacterial environment, or lack of appropriate bacterial chaperone proteins [4,5]. Several strategies are commonly employed to reduce inclusion bodies: a) controlling the rate of protein synthesis, b) enabling secretion into the periplasm, and c) co-expression of chaperone genes. The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [6]. The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing [1,5,7,8,9,10], although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm [11,12]. The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins [13,14,15,16]. Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins [17,18,19]. Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

            "text": "Cell morphology changes due to carbon limitation, even under constant growth conditions in a tightly controlled bioreactor environment. In addition, we provide evidence that recombinant peptide production leads to significant softening and fluidisation of E. coli cells. Previous studies regarding mechanical properties and morphology of bacteria mostly used small-scale cultivation in shake flasks with low cell densities, and the cells were usually harvested after a short time of growth. The results obtained in this study revealed that the shape and mechanical properties of the cells contain process-relevant information. They presumably can contribute to the improvement of the design and characterization of future bioprocesses. \n\nIntracellular protein accumulation is a result of the interplay between synthesis and degradation [27]. Our results imply a specific peptide maximum after approximately 19 h of cultivation, with a decreasing peptide production from then on. Before the maximum, the ratio between the synthesis and degradation was on the synthesis side, which seemingly inversed afterwards. Fast-growing bacteria such as E. coli are known for fast adaptation towards various extra-and intracellular changes. We suggest that regulatory adaption mechanisms negatively influence recombinant peptide expression [28]. Moreover, a considerable number of cells in the performed cultivations lysed, likely due to overloading the cells with the strong T7 promoter system [15]. This led to increasing amounts of the extracellular peptide. The influence of product formation on the biomass yield and glucose consumption under described cultivation conditions has been characterized in a detailed C-balancing study [29].

            "text": "Proteins are catalysers of metabolic reactions, structural components of biological assemblies, and responsible for inter and intracellular interactions and cell signalling events that are critical for life. Therefore, deficiencies in the production of specific polypeptides or the synthesis of mutant, non-functional versions of biologically relevant protein usually derive in pathologies that can range from mild to severe. In humans, such diseases can be treated by the clinical administration of the missing protein from external sources, to reach ordinary concentrations at systemic or tissular levels [1]. Therefore, many human proteins have an important pharmaceutical value but they are difficult to obtain from their natural sources. Recom-binant DNA (rDNA) technologies, developed in the late 70's using the bacterium Escherichia coli as a biological framework, offer a very potent set of technical platforms for the controlled and scalable production of polypeptides of interest by relatively inexpensive procedures. This can be done in convenient microbial cells such as bacteria and yeasts, whose cultivation can be accomplished by relatively simple procedures and instrumentation. In early 80's, the FDA approved the clinical use of recombinant human insulin from recombinant E. coli (Humulin-US/ Humuline-EU) for the treatment of diabetes [2], being the first recombinant pharmaceutical to enter the market. The versatility and scaling-up possibilities of the recombinant protein production opened up new commercial opportu-nities for pharmaceutical companies. Since the approval of recombinant insulin, other recombinant DNA drugs have been marketed in parallel with the development and improvement of several heterologous protein production systems. This has generated specific strains of many microbial species adapted to protein production, and has allowed the progressive incorporation of yeasts and eukaryotic systems for this purpose. Among the 151 protein-based recombinant pharmaceuticals licensed up to January 2009 by the FDA and EMEA, 45 (29.8%) are obtained in Escherichia coli, 28 (18.5%) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 17 (11.2%) in hybridoma cells, 1 in transgenic goat milk, 1 in insect cells and 59 (39%) in mammalian cells ( Figure 1) [3].

            "text": "Human aFGF is a multifunction factor involved in a variety of biological processes, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. To reduce the potential side effects or improve the stability of haFGF, several shortened or modified versions were developed, including haFGF 127 (Lozano et al., 2000), haFGF 135 (Cheng and Kuo, 2011), and TAT-haFGF 19-154 -His (Huang et al., 2008). As shown in Table 4  fusion technology. However, there have been practically no available reports or detailed studies regarding the larger scale fermentation and purification of rhaFGF 135 in E. coli. In this study, we developed a stable and efficient process of 30-L scale high cell-density fermentation and purification protocol to achieve high production of the high-purity rhaFGF 135 protein in E. coli.\n\nEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) plysS was chosen as the host bacteria because it contains the small plasmid that encodes T7 lysozyme, which effectively inhibits the expression of nontarget proteins without influencing the level of the target protein.\n\nCompared with E. coli JM109, E. coli BL21(DE3) accumulates much less acetic acid, and its cell culture density is higher by 25%. To enhance the specific synthesis rate of the target protein, we used 10% inoculation quantity of strains to shorten the lag phase during which the specific growth rate increases rapidly (within 1 h, as shown in Figure 4D). For example, Hu et al. (2009) were able to improve the final bacterial density and yield of HT-1 fusion protein (from 44.2 to 53.9 g/L and from 2.45 to 3.05 g/L) by increasing the inoculation quantity of strains from 5 to 10%.\n\nOptimizing the fermentation parameters such as temperature, pH, and DO would create the most appropriate environment to  obtain high yield of the rhaFGF 135 protein in the recombinant E. coli strain. Glucose is a common carbon source for E. coli high-density fermentation. As shown in Figure 2E, the media containing 5.0-10",

            "text": "The production of proteins in adequate quantity and quality is a necessary demand of the present time. Before we begin any bio therapeutic development program, we must pay close attention in choosing a suitable host system for the expression of recombinant proteins. Since a gene can be expressed in multiple systems and different hosts, and it can express proteins with different efficiencies as well as variant posttranslational modifications, determining the best system for expression of recombinant proteins is one of the most important issues in biotechnology. A recombinant protein expression system must be able to produce the biological material with the highest biological activity and safety while it has the lowest cost. Scientists must also consider the expression system's productivity, consistency, and the current regulatory environment (1). \n\nThere are numerous available expression systems for large scale production of recombinant proteins includ-ing Escherichia coli (E. coli), yeast, insect, and several mammalian based systems. Each of these has its own relevant advantages depending on cost, simplicity, and their post-translational modification profiles (2). Now, some famous companies are using eukaryotic systems to produce recombinant proteins. Among them, mammalian expression systems are the main expression systems for the production of recombinant human proteins. Mammalian cell expression systems have several advantages over other eukaryotic expression systems (3). Mammalian expression systems are able to fulfill the appropriate posttranslational modifications, which are important for protein folding, product assemblies, and biological activity. However, it should be noted that there are differences between species. A large number of mammalian cells including myeloma (NS0 and SP2/0) cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human retina-derived cells (PerC6), COS and Vero (both green African monkey kidney), Human cervical cancer (HeLa), human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, as well as baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells have been successfully used to express recombinant proteins (2).",

            "text": "Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli is the most commonly used prokaryotic expression system; this has been facilitated by a deep understanding of the bacterial genome, genetics, physiology, and mechanisms underlying gene expression. E. coli grow rapidly in culture and can achieve high-density growth in a short period of time using inexpensive media that is suitable for continuous fermentation. The yield of recombinant protein per unit volume tends to be relatively high, and can represent up to 30% of the secreted protein. Recombinant lipase expressed in E. coli can be located in the cytoplasm or secreted to the extracellular environment; it can exist in the form of inclusion bodies or expressed as a fusion protein with a FLAG epitope tag or fluorescent protein in order to avoid intracellular degradation and to simplify the subsequent separation and purification processes (Yin et al., 2007). \n\nHowever, heterologous expression in E. coli is associated with the following disadvantages: (1) when eukaryotic proteins, especially heterologous proteins containing disulfide bonds, are expressed in E. coli, inactive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be formed due to improper protein folding; (2) Heterologous proteins that are not secreted often do not undergo proper folding and post-translational modification; this can lead to inactivation and degradation of heterologous proteins by the host; (3) the recombinant protein of interest needs to be separated from many background E. coli proteins, resulting in the need for complex separation and purification steps; (4) the E. coli expression systems involves contamination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is a proinflammatory molecule in mammalian hosts that plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction with the innate immune system. Other commonly used prokaryotic expression systems include those based in B. subtilis, Ralstonia eutropha, and Pseudomonas spp. Compared with the E. coli expression system, the B. subtilis system facilitates recombinant protein secretion, and has no Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide components; as such, this system is suitable for large-scale highdensity fermentation.",

            "text": "ecombinant pharmaceutical proteins such as antibody fragments offer many advantages over traditional drugs. There are several platforms for production of target recombinant proteins, including bacterial, yeasts, and mammalian expression systems [1,2] . Although the selection of the expression host is dependent on the nature of the target protein, the E. coli expression system is the preferred host for screening and even initial development of commercial recombinant products [3,4] . The advantages of using E. coli as a bacterial expression system include the rapid growth rate to high cell density, inexpensive production substrate, and easy genetic manipulation and transformation [4,5] . The efficiency of the recombinant protein expression in this host is related to the genetic characteristics of the E. coli strain, expression vectors and the target heterologous protein.\n\nIn addition, manipulation of the expression process to optimize protein production is essential to enhance the yield of the protein [6] . The classical method for optimization of a protein expression is to change one factor at a time while keeping other factors constant. This method is often ineffective because changing one factor at a time does not represent the combined effect of the involved variables. In addition, it is a timeconsuming process and needs a large number of experiments [6,7] . To overcome this problem, the best approach is to use the statistical design of experiments, which allows simultaneous evaluation of many more variables at lower cost with a few experimental trials [6][7][8] . In view of this consideration, the goal of this work was to improve the expression of a previously described fusion protein, anti-CD22 scFv-apoptin, in E. coli [9] , using experimental design.",

            "text": "Moreover, CFPS is a suitable platform for synthesizing difficult to express proteins, like membrane-anchored proteins [19], proteins with incorporated non-natural amino acids [20], and proteins with a toxic effect on the metabolism of the host cell [21]. Although several CFPS systems are described and have their own advantages, the E. coli-based system is the most commonly used due to high protein synthesis rates with high protein yields, streamlined and cost-effective cultivation and extract preparation, and the ability to fold complex proteins. Additionally, this system has been well studied and optimized during recent years [22,23]. E. coli is also one of the most used expression strains for cell-based protein synthesis. Although the synthesis of complex proteins derived from higher organisms might be challenging, the applicability of CFPS was already demonstrated in different studies. Mammal proteins were successfully produced with E. coli-based CFPS systems, such as therapeutic proteins [24] and human phosphoproteins [25]. The combination of rapid synthesis and the ability to synthesize complex proteins makes CFPS a powerful tool for enzyme screening [26]. Since the synthesis of mammalian proteins is generally possible, CFPS could also be used for the synthesis of cGAS, thereby accelerating the screening of previously unstudied cGAS homologues and elucidating their function. \n\nIn this study, different cGAS homologues, which have never been characterized biochemically before, were synthesized with two E. coli-based systems and investigated with regard to their ability to produce cGAMP and their corresponding activity in in vitro assays. An E. coli-based CFPS system was used to quickly validate the applicability of E. coli as an expression host for enzymes originating from various metazoans. We demonstrate that the putative cGAS homologues can be expressed recombinantly in E. coli and four previously unknown cGAS variants could be proven to be functional producers of cGAMP. These results extend the list of described cGAS homologues and might contribute to determine the key residues that are responsible for altered functions and can guide protein engineering to evolve cGAS.",

High cell density cultivation (HCDC) of recombinant E. coli is a major strategy for maximizing volumetric productivity of recombinant proteins [24,25]. High cell densities can be reached by fed-batch cultivation, thereby reducing culture volume, enhancing biomass production and product recovery and hence reducing costs significantly. So far only one report describing a fed-batch bioprocess for in vivo production of a glycoconjugate vaccine against S. dysenteriae O1 in E. coli has been published [18]. \n\nIn this study we report on (i) the establishment of an in vivo production system for the expression of a glycoconjugate vaccine against S. flexneri 2a in E. coli, (ii) the identification of critical parameters and cultivation conditions influencing the in vivo glycosylation efficiency and finally (iii) the transfer of the identified conditions to high cell density cultivations under controlled conditions to increase overall glycoconjugate yield.

            "text": "Membrane proteins (MPs) constitute a highly important protein group in all living cells and organisms.They are basic components of membrane bilayers, where they perform multiple essential functions, such as maintenance of structural integrity, cellular signaling, as well as nutrient and ion transport (von Heijne, 2007).Their great importance is reflected by the fact that, among all proteins encoded in the genome of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, 20%-30% correspond to MPs (Wagner et al., 2006).Due to their critical functions, MPs represent more than half of all known drug targets (Yildirim et al., 2007).Furthermore, there is a constant focus on investigating their structure and function to gain in-depth knowledge, which can then be utilized for the development of new MP-targeting therapeutic molecules (Santos et al., 2017).\n\nTo acquire sufficient quantities of isolated MPs for performing the necessary biochemical and structural analyses, it is most common to produce them recombinantly in heterologous hosts, such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells or transgenic animals.This occurs because, typically, natural abundance of MPs occurs at very low levels (Sarramegna et al., 2003).The bacterium Escherichia coli has been one of the most popular and successful host organisms for recombinant production of both soluble and membrane proteins (Makino et al., 2011).Among its many advantages, E. coli is preferred due to its facile and low-cost culture conditions, its rapid growth and the numerous available tools for its genetic manipulation (Mathieu et al., 2019).As a result, approximately 20% of all MP structures deposited at Protein Data Bank (PDB) have been derived from proteins, which have been produced recombinantly in E. coli (Dilworth et al., 2018).Despite the many successful examples, bacterial MP production has proven to be a particularly challenging process in many cases, which is often accompanied by severe toxicity for the expression host and low levels of cellular accumulation of the target recombinant MP in membrane-integrated form (Wagner et al., 2006).",

            "text": "There are numerous standardized systems for heterologous protein expression. The most widely used expression hosts are Escherichia coli, insect cells infected with baculovirus, mammalian cells, molds, and yeasts (25)(26)(27). Bacterial expression systems, such as the Escherichia coli expression system, are readily available and have unparalleled fast growth kinetics, inexpensive media, and high-level expression when producing a recombinant protein, but this system lacks the ability to create posttranslational modifications (28). Among the many posttranslational modifications that occur during protein expression, glycosylation is often important, and various glycosylation patterns can significantly affect protein functions, such as stability, folding, and secretion (29). Importantly, studies have shown that the lack of glycosylation decreases the secretion of irisin and is also related to the instability of its precursor protein FNDC5 (30). For providing posttranslational modifications of recombinant heterologous proteins, mammalian cell lines possess significant strengths. However, lower growth rates and expensive nutrient requirements limit their use in large-scale production (31). The yeast expression system, with its capability of performing many eukaryotic posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, proteolytic processing, and disulfide bond formation, offers an excellent recombinant eukaryotic protein expression system (32,33). Among all yeast species, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, with its characteristic of simple manipulation and high yield, is a widely recognized efficient protein production tool (33). \n\nTherefore, in this work, we chose the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as an efficient tool for the large-scale production of high purity recombinant secretable FNDC5 (r-sFNDC5). The biological activities of r-sFNDC5 in energy expenditure, browning, and lipolysis were further explored and compared with those of irisin in adipocytes.",

            "text": "Abstract This review article concerns the production of recombinant antibody fragments for applications mainly in the diagnostic sector. The so-called \u201cpoint of care diagnostics\u201d is very important for timely diagnosis and treatment, thus being able to save lives and resources. There is intense pressure for more accurate and less expensive rapid diagnostic tests, with a value preferably <$1. Thus, the large-scale cost-effective production of recombinant antibodies is vital. The importance of Escherichia coli toward the production of inexpensive rapid tests will be explained in this review paper. Details about the different strains of E. coli, the strategies used for the insertion and the expression of recombinant proteins, and the challenges that still exist are provided. Afterward, the importance of the expression scale and culture parameters in the final yield of the antibodies are examined. From this analysis, it appears that for good yields of recombinant antibodies, aside from appropriate gene transfer and expression, the culturing parameters are of paramount importance. Larger scale production is more favorable, mainly due to the higher cell densities that can be achieved. Yields of functional Fab fragments in the range of 10\u201320\u2009mg/L are considered good in shake flasks, whereas in bioreactors can be up to 1\u20132\u2009g/L. An amount of 10\u2013500\u2009mg of such antibody per million rapid tests is required. Despite the substantial importance of the production of the antibodies and their fragments, their downstream processing should be appropriately considered from the beginning for achieving the target value of the final rapid diagnostic tests.",

            "text": "The ability to achieve high-throughput protein production is a major advantage of CFPS, as it enables rapid production and screening of a variety of protein products much faster than in in vivo protein expression (Figure 1). Coupled CFPS allows for DNA templates to be plugged in directly without the need for cell transformation/transfection, and in some cases, assays of protein products can be done without the need for purification, creating a powerful one-pot system [28]. A key application of high-throughput CFPS is functional genomics, which allows for the elucidation of new genes and their corresponding protein function. High-throughput screening can be pursued in any platform, but most often utilizes E. coli, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte extracts. Here we will discuss some specific examples of CFPS for high-throughput applications. \n\nThe E. coli platform has been widely used and is well-developed, with relatively simple extract preparation and high yields making it a prime candidate for high-throughput synthesis (Table 2, Figure 2). One notable application of E. coli-based CFPS is the ability to screen antibody mutant libraries in rapid design-build-test cycles for antibody engineering. The best mutants could later be scaled up in the same platform for industrial level synthesis (see Section 3.2.5, titled \"Large-Scale\") [2]. Additionally, the E. coli platform has been used for high-throughput functional genomics to identify numerous gene products involved in complex metabolic systems that result in protein accumulation and folding in vitro [3]. \n\nWhile high-throughput applications commonly utilize E. coli, the eukaryotic wheat germ platform has advantages for synthesis of soluble, active protein, making it better suited for structural and functional analysis of certain proteins in CFPS [79]. The wheat germ platform has shown the capacity to perform as a \"human protein factory\" when it was utilized in an attempt to produce 13,364 human proteins. Using the versatile Gateway vector system to generate entry clones allowed for successful synthesis of 12,996 of the human proteins, with many displaying successful function [80].",

            "text": "Pichia pastoris has been established as a highly common organism for recombinant protein production. This yeast offers an ideal balance between genetic manipulability, streamlined protein production, and the ability to post-translationally modify proteins [1,2]. Straightforward manipulation of the yeast genome, compared to mammalian cells, allows for the introduction of foreign genes and metabolic engineering with reduced effort [3]. Another advantage is the availability of regulatable promoters, such as the methanolinducible AOX1 promoter, as a highly controllable genetic switch that enables precise control of target protein expression [4]. P. pastoris is easily scalable and also known for its ability to produce high levels of recombinant proteins, efficiently secrete proteins, and realize complex post-translational modifications, including glycosylation [5][6][7]. The presence of yeast-like glycans can lead to adverse reactions when glycosylated proteins were applied for human applications [8]. In contrast to the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which produces proteins with high mannose glycosylation, P. pastoris-based protein production results in fewer immunogenic glycosylation patterns and can grow to higher cell densities [9]. The simple handling during cultivation and transformation, as well as a doubling time of 1-3 h, lead to time-saving protein production in P. pastoris [10]. \n\nThe properties of P. pastoris in recombinant protein production make it useful for cellfree synthesis of proteins, especially toxic proteins and membrane proteins [11,12]. Most importantly, it allows for the rapid production of proteins without depending on the growth and maintenance of living cell cultures. Proteins can be produced up to 60 \u00b5g/mL within 90-180 min in yeast-based cell-free systems, substantially accelerating the production of biotechnologically demanding proteins [13,14]. Furthermore, cell-free protein synthesis allows for precise control over production conditions, which can lead to higher yields and quality of the proteins produced [15].",

Lipase production was 11.07 U/mL when first attempt to fermenter operation was done, nearly 4 times lower than that produced in shake bottle scale. Optimization of fermentation conditions such as inoculum age and temperature were carried out and compared. A substantial high activity of lipase was detected during fermentation using 10 h inoculum. Lipase production was 41.18 U/mL which was comparable to previous optimized shake bottle and was 3.7 times higher than with 24 h inoculum. Increasing the cultivation temperature to 37\u00b0C, resulted in an increased of lipase production to 89.82 U/mL with highest cell mass attained of 6.63 g/L. the best approach to expressing the selected protein (Hussian et al., 2023). Recently, Escherichia coli is still the most favourable and advantageous host organism for recombinant protein production (Zulkifly et al., 2023). As most E. coli strains are aerobic mesophiles, culturing in a fully equipped fermenter is the most suitable approach to enhance growth and protein production. In addition, the fast growth rate and ease of cultivation technology for E. \n\ncoli make it suitable for industrial applications (Abdel -Fattah and Gaballa, 2008). \n\nAs scaling-up study with fermenter operation is an initial stage of establish2ing commercial production of an enzyme, various parameters, including physical, nutrient, and mode of fermentation, can be exploited in order to obtain the optimum process that leads to high protein production, both economically and practically (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2012; Ismail et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been used as an expression host for the production of a wide range of recombinant proteins (Baneyx 1999;Baneyx and Mujacic 2004). Several expression systems have been developed for the high-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli (Makrides 1996). Among the various expression systems used, the temperature-inducible expression system has been beneficial due to the ease of induction and higher induction strength (Seeger et al. 1995;Gupta et al. 1999). \n\nHowever, the use of temperature up-shift as an induction mechanism influences several cellular processes, including the up-regulation of the heat shock proteins such as molecular chaperones and proteases (Hoffmann et al. 2002;Weber et al. 2002). \n\nThe role of induction mechanism on recombinant protein production has been investigated for certain recombinant proteins in the literature. For an aggregation prone recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, the temperature-induced expression was found to result in increased productivity and higher yield (Seeger et al. 1995). In the case of soluble Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) the productivity of the temperatureinducible system was lower compared to chemicallyinduced system (Harcum and Haddadin 2006). Further, the global transcriptome response of recombinant E. coli producing soluble recombinant CAT was analyzed during chemical induction, temperature induction and dual induction conditions (chemical and temperature induction). The transcriptome response of the classical heat shock genes was found to be similar in the wild-type and dual stressed cultures, even though many other genes were found to be differentially expressed in these cultures. This indicates that modeling the dynamics of the heat shock proteins and their mechanism of interaction with the recombinant protein could give useful insights. \n\nThe role played by the various heat shock proteins in assisting solubilization, folding and degradation of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been extensively reviewed by Hoffmann and Rinas (2004).",

            "text": "In synthetic biology and biotechnology, expression processes are mainly observed on averagebased population scale, thus ignoring phenotypic heterogeneity especially in case of adequate overall yields and functionality. However, cell-to-cell heterogeneity may distinctly hamper overall product yields [43]. This becomes most evident for toxic gene products [44] and if non- producing cells overgrow the culture due to a faster growth [45]. Unraveling phenotypic heterogeneity is therefore a key aspect in understanding and optimizing recombinant protein production. \n\nIn order to precisely analyze expression systems at single-cell level, cells have to be characterized under well-defined environmental conditions, enabling one to distinguish between phenotypic (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) heterogeneity [36,43]. \n\nThis challenge was strikingly tackled in recent years by means of microfluidic single-cell cultivation approaches. These allow for cultivations under precisely controlled cultivation conditions implemented by continuously perfused cultivation medium (Fig 2A). Here, laminar flow conditions and diffusion-dominated mass transport lead to well predictable environmental homogeneity. Furthermore, microfluidics in combination with time-lapse imaging facilitates the analysis of cellular behavior and physiology with high spatiotemporal resolution [34][35][36]. We thus employed novel microfluidic bioreactor systems [36] for cultivation and in vivo fluorescence reporter-based monitoring of gene expression in common E. coli expression systems to uncover system-inherent specifications including responsiveness, growth behavior and expression phenotype (Fig 2B). \n\nComplex growth media such as LB medium are widely used for the cultivation of E. coli in both bulk and single-cell analysis. In contrast to synthetic media, they contain yeast extracts, which are chemically not accurately defined, thus limiting exact knowledge about the nutrient composition. Moreover, distinct variations between different yeast extract suppliers or lots might occur [46]. Our preliminary analyses of the carbohydrate composition of different LB cultivation media (S2 Table, S1 Appendix) and its impact on expression strength and homogeneity (S1 Fig) revealed striking differences.",

            "text": "Recombinant antibody production technology has been cultivated and implemented in the biopharmaceutical industry, as it elicits high consistency and reproducibility. Appleby et al. created a humanized monoclonal antibody against human MMP9 (hMMP9) and described its enzymatical activity by investigating the three-dimensional structure (PDB: 5th9) [10]. Even though the sequence of this antibody was disclosed as well as the recombinant antibody was opportunely generated, the yield was not adequate for a large-scale expression. Hence, additional development of the production performance was imperative. \n\nMammalian cell expression systems are the preference to produce eukaryotic proteins, as they facilitate post-translation modifications, which are critical for the correct folding of proteins. Glycoproteins including antibodies are usually synthesized in mammalian cells, whereas microbial hosts, such as E. coli, are without the requisite machinery to synthesize proper glycosylated forms [13,14]. Either transient transfection or development of a stable cell line is the approach to produce antibodies in mammalian cells, and those production outputs are typically much higher than those by E. coli-based production. It is possible to generate secreted mammalian proteins in a large-scale format in mammalian cells, such as human embryonic kidney (HEK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Transient cell lines, such as HEK cells, have been utilized because of their high transfection effectiveness and antibody production capacity. It has been demonstrated, however, that there are variances in the manufacturability, affinity, and efficacy of antibodies developed in HEK cells compared with those created by stably transfected CHO cells [15]. A stable CHO cell line is extensively used in adept antibody production because it performs human-compatible post-translational modifications and does not spread human pathogenic viruses [16]. Thus, CHO cell expression has become predominant for fabricating owing to its capability to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibody or antibody fragments with a constant quality [17,18].",

            "text": "A complete comparison with several other production systems could be visualized in this review [14]. \n\nDue to its characteristics, the eukaryotic organism yeast is one of the expression systems widely used in the industry [15]. This organism presents advantages in its use, range of reproduction, culture in confinement (biological reactors), and an average cost of production; however, it has disadvantages such as post-translational modifications being significantly different from humans, and the high price of scale-up costs [14], require preliminary analysis to consider this system for the production of antigens. In the case of eukaryotic cell systems, including invertebrate and mammalian cell lines, advantages include the ability to achieve post-translational modifications resulting in high-quality products and efficient protein secretion to the medium, which facilitates purification and the availability of standard methods for genetic manipulation [16,17]. Nonetheless, its production cost, the high nutrient requirements, cell growth rate, and the risk of contamination by pathogens (viruses, bacteria, prions), in some cases, limit their use in vaccine production models [17]. A different approach to producing recombinant proteins is the generation of genetically modified organisms, e.g., plants and animals. The main advantage of using transgenic animals to produce recombinant proteins is the high yields of a high-quality product. Despite its benefits, the process of generating transgenic animals implies a long time between the genetic engineering phase and the start of production, a low rate of gene integration, and unpredictable behavior of the transgenes [18,19]. In particular, plants such as cereals, tobacco, legumes, fruits, and vegetables [19], present attractive advantages for their use in the production of recombinant proteins due to their production cost, the capacity of post-translational modifications, cultivation cost advantages, and low scale-up cost [8], but disadvantages such as production time, lacks regulatory approval [19], as well as the possible genetic contamination in populations of non-genetically modified plants [20], hinder its mass production. Plant cell culture in vitro represents an essential role as a new expression platform at the industrial level [21].",

            "text": "Heterologous proteins are produced in several established expression systems, such as Escherichia coli, mammalian cell lines and yeast, but several systems are in the developing pipeline. Appropriate expression system choice should be based on priorities regarding performance and requirements of each recombinant protein (Walsh 2014). Currently, mammalian \"CHO\" cells (Chinese Hamster Ovary) and E. coli are the most used systems, which correspond to 35.5% and 19%, respectively, of the total products approved by the FDA in biopharmaceuticals (Walsh 2014). E. coli cells have rapid growth, productivity and low production cost, but it is a system unable to produce complex proteins and some posttranslational modifications. Moreover, the production of endotoxins and inclusion bodies requires more purification process steps (Petsch 2000). \n\nTherapeutic proteins are preferably produced in transgenic mammalian cell systems, because of their ability to express and correctly fold proteins. However, its production cost is high, especially when compared to plants as expression systems. Molecules such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are mainly produced in mammalian cells and their average production cost in this system is estimated to be $ 150.00 per gram of raw materials, whereas production in plant systems costs approximately US$0.05 per gram (Dove 2002, Mayfield et al. 2003). But the estimated value for algae reaches US $ 0.002 per liter, making them potential competitors for land plants (Mayfield et al. 2003). Microalgae present several desirable features in an expression system, such as: rapid growth (characteristic for microbial growth), swift and stable transgenic lineage generation, scalability and low-cost production (Wijffels et al. 2013, Rosenberg et al. 2008). They are also able to produce and secrete complex proteins and perform post-transcriptional modifications. They are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS), with low risk of virus contamination, prions or bacterial endotoxins, and establish no gene flow with the flora around through pollens as in transgenic plants (Mayfield et al. 2007). \n\nHowever, the studies on genetic engineering using microalgae are incipient and present challenges.",

            "text": "However, E. coli a bacterial expression host is still a choice of system due to its well characterized genetics, rapid growth rate and use of inexpensive substrates for cultivations [11,12,13]. Many proteins of vaccine or therapeutic use are produced in E. coli using batch and fed-batch fermentation process [11][12][13][14]. It would be very useful if the optimized production as well as purification processes could be easily scaled up to an industrial scale for the bioprocess industry. Fermentation media, mode of fermentation, scale up and culture conditions are the most significant factors in a production process. Media composition especially with the essential carbon and nitrogen components is optimized to produce large amount of desired product. Fed-batch fermentation is a common technique in this regard to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins [14,15,16]. Increasing the scale of production is usually associated with reduction in the desired product yield due to the complexity associated with fermentation process. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the scaling up of laboratory scale fermentation process and apply suitable strategy in order to enhance the productivity of the desired recombinant protein on the large scale. \n\nHigh-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often accumulates as insoluble, inactive aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies in vivo [17,18,19]. Although the recombinant protein expression in the form of IBs has advantages, the inactive recombinant proteins need to be converted into soluble and correctly folded proteins [20]. The solubilization of IBs was carried out using higher concentration of denaturing agent which must be removed using refolding processes to obtain biologically active recombinant product for vaccine studies. In recent years, several refolding techniques such as rapid dilution, dialysis, diafiltration, high pH solubilization and on column refolding using chromatographic techniques have been used for recovery of bioactive recombinant proteins [17,20,21,22]. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has emerged as a powerful technique for purification of recombinant proteins [22].",

            "text": "High-level production of recombinant proteins as a prerequisite for subsequent purification has become a standard technique. Important applications of recombinant proteins are: (1) immunization, (2) biochemical studies, (3) three-dimensional analysis of the protein, and (4) biotechnological and therapeutic use. Production of recombinant proteins involves cloning of the appropriate gene into an expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. But efficient expression of the recombinant gene depends on a variety of factors such as optimal expression signals (both at the level of transcription and translation), correct protein folding and cell growth characteristics. Display of recombinant proteins on the bacterial surface has many potential biotechnological applications and requires further knowledge on targeting motifs present on carrier proteins usually used as fusion partners. In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of design, process and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian expression systems have been reviewed in Marino (1989). \n\nThis review article deals exclusively with Escherichia coli cells as a protein factory. Despite its extensive knowledge on genetics and molecular biology, there is no a priori guarantee that every gene can be expressed efficiently in this Gram-negative bacterium. Factors influencing the expression level include unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and efficiency of mRNA, correct and efficient protein folding, codon usage, degradation of the recombinant protein by ATP-dependent proteases and toxicity of the protein. The objectives of this article are to review the potential influence of these different parameters on the yield of recombinant proteins and to provide the reader with practical suggestions allowing optimization of recombinant protein production and targeting to different compartments of the bacterial cell.

            "text": "As early as 1978, genetically modified Escherichia coli was used for the synthetic production of human insulin [1]. In the recent past, E. coli became one of the most often used prokaryotic expression systems for production of recombinant proteins. This can be attributed to the today sequenced genome [2]. E. coli allows for an easy introduction of foreign genes [2][3][4]. Furthermore, this bacterium can grow fast on low-cost media reaching high cell densities which is advantageous for economical protein production [3]. \n\nIn the literature, it is known that the production of recombinant proteins can negatively affect the microbial growth by a process often termed metabolic burden [5]. To ensure sufficient biomass concentration for protein production, the culture is often divided into a growth phase and a subsequent production phase by applying controllable expression systems. Such expression systems are externally controlled, for example by temperature shift [6], certain levels of the dissolved oxygen tension [7] or chemical inducers [4]. The most popular inducer molecule in laboratory scale is probably isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). It was shown that the time-point of induction as well as the amount of added inducing compound have significant impact on the culture [8][9][10]. Thus, it is crucial to find optimal induction parameters revealing a balanced process. Insufficient or too strong induction have to be avoided to achieve high product yield. Unfortunately, optimal induction parameters found for a specific system are not universally valid and, thus, a direct transfer from bioprocess to bioprocess is not possible. The optimal combination of induction time and inducer concentration depend besides other factors on the E. coli host strain, the expression plasmid or the recombinant gene [11][12][13]. For each bioprocess, optimization of the induction parameters has to be carried out. This results in numerous cultivations that have to be conducted. Therefore, small-scale highthroughput screening devices are often applied that allow for cost-efficient studies of parallel cultures [14].",

            "text": "As early as 1978, genetically modified Escherichia coli was used for the synthetic production of human insulin [1]. In the recent past, E. coli became one of the most often used prokaryotic expression systems for production of recombinant proteins. This can be attributed to the today sequenced genome [2]. E. coli allows for an easy introduction of foreign genes [2][3][4]. Furthermore, this bacterium can grow fast on low-cost media reaching high cell densities which is advantageous for economical protein production [3]. \n\nIn the literature, it is known that the production of recombinant proteins can negatively affect the microbial growth by a process often termed metabolic burden [5]. To ensure sufficient biomass concentration for protein production, the culture is often divided into a growth phase and a subsequent production phase by applying controllable expression systems. Such expression systems are externally controlled, for example by temperature shift [6], certain levels of the dissolved oxygen tension [7] or chemical inducers [4]. The most popular inducer molecule in laboratory scale is probably isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). It was shown that the time-point of induction as well as the amount of added inducing compound have significant impact on the culture [8][9][10]. Thus, it is crucial to find optimal induction parameters revealing a balanced process. Insufficient or too strong induction have to be avoided to achieve high product yield. Unfortunately, optimal induction parameters found for a specific system are not universally valid and, thus, a direct transfer from bioprocess to bioprocess is not possible. The optimal combination of induction time and inducer concentration depend besides other factors on the E. coli host strain, the expression plasmid or the recombinant gene [11][12][13]. For each bioprocess, optimization of the induction parameters has to be carried out. This results in numerous cultivations that have to be conducted. Therefore, small-scale highthroughput screening devices are often applied that allow for cost-efficient studies of parallel cultures [14].",

However, the former media do not feature the pH maintenance capacity of EnPresso media, which is of special importance for long term and economic large scale production as carried out in industrial applications.\n\nHigher expression levels of correctly folded recombinant antibody fragments may be achieved by modifying the culture conditions such as temperature and oxygen transfer. For example, Ukkonen and co-workers were able to increase the cell density as well as the active yield of a recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli by the combined use of EnPresso medium and high-aeration shake flasks [52].\n\nCharacterizations of the cytoplasmically expressed and purified sdAbs demonstrate that the vast majority of the cysteine residues are in the oxidized state and almost no sdAb dimers are detectable (Table 2 and Figure 5). These results indicate that the desired intradomain S-S bond within the sdAb monomer is formed favorably over an aberrant intermolecular disulfide between two sdAb molecules. This is most likely attributable to the rather slow kinetics of protein oxidation in the cytoplasm as already discussed by Bessette and co-workers for the oxidation of alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasm of a comparable E. coli strain. According to the authors, at slow oxidation rates, the native conformation of the recombinant protein determines the disulfide bond formation and leads to bridging of the proper cysteine residues [33]. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of oxidized sdAbs expressed in the reducing cytoplasm of the standard expression host E. coli BL21(DE3) could be detected. Similar findings were already described in literature, e.g. J\u00e4rviluoma and colleagues purified comparable amounts of functional sdAb derivative from E. coli BL21(DE3) and from trxB gor mutant Origami(",

            "text": "Recombinant protein therapeutics comprise a significant part of approved biotechnology-based medicines. Production systems for recombinant proteins include bacteria, yeast, insect and mammalian cells. Bacterial expression systems for recombinant human-derived proteins are widely used, but limited as most bacteria lack certain posttranslational modification (PTM) mechanisms, including those for glycosylation [1]. In general, glycoproteins are produced in eukaryotic cell lines such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO), murine myeloma (NS0) or Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) [2]. Proteins stabilised by multiple disulfide bonds are preferentially expressed in eukaryotic CHO, yeast and insect cells, a production process that is often time consuming and cost-intensive [3].\n\nAbout a third of the currently approved recombinant protein therapeutics are produced in E. coli strains [4]. The use of bacteria as expression hosts provides many advantages such as rapid growth, low-cost media, a versatility of cloning tools combined with the potential to produce compounds with high yield and quality [4,5]. So far, E. coli-based systems have been employed to express non-glycosylated proteins, however, the development of engineered strains allowing the expression of complex therapeutics including correct folding, disulfide bond formation, and glycosylation modifications are highly desirable and may potentially lead to a significant decrease in process time and costs [2,6].\n\nGlycosylation represents one of the most common posttranslational modifications, with N-and O-linked glycosylation requiring the activity of specific glycosyltransferases [2,7]. N-glycosylations take place on an amide nitrogen of the amino acid asparagine and O-glycosylations on mucin are initiated by the addition of the monosaccharide N-acetylgalactosamine to the hydroxyl group of the amino acids serine or threonine [8][9][10][11].

            "text": "In a continuous system cell retention is accomplished via filtration of the product through a membrane, immobilization on a carrier material or by exploiting cellular flocculation [66]. Expression of the heterologous protein causes cell resources to be applied to the transcription and translation of the recombinant protein at the expense of the host cell metabolism. The term metabolic load describes this allocation of resources to heterogenous protein production at the cost of cellular activity to the detriment of the cell, reduced growth capacity and specific growth rate [30]. Furthermore, the effect of metabolic load is greater with larger recombinant gene sizes, copy number, expression levels and issues with nutrient and dissolved oxygen availability [68]. Secretion of the desired protein product greatly simplifies the extraction and purification processes of downstream processing [28]. Protein secretion is initiated by transporting the protein through the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to signals which directly impact the protein yield [11]. Misfolded protein is degraded prior to secretion and may damage the ER, the presence of protein folding chaperones and redox enzymes should be over expressed in yeast systems [11]. Studies describe the production of more than one drug or combination drugs simultaneously in a single batch which offers clear advantages over single biological production [8]. Synthetic biology as recently emerged as a promising field in the area of medical and therapeutic science having application in the production of drugs, vaccines and biosensors [69]. Synthetic biology involves the assembly of a specialized systems designed for a biologic purpose and incorporates engineering into bioprocessing technologies. As expression systems for synthetic biology E. coli and S. cerevisiae are most frequently utilised due to their broad ranging advantages [70]. Synthetic biology allows for enhanced production of biologics via modulation of gene circuits impacting on expression levels, protein levels, and pathway levels of expression systems via engineering of promoters, terminators, etc. [71].",

Plants are not only \"the lungs\" of our planet and the most important source of food, energy, and raw materials in everyday life but also the source of manifold valuable therapeutic compounds traditionally used by humankind for the management of various maladies and diseases. The current relevance of plants is additionally emphasized by their utility as alternative expression systems for bulk production of recombinant proteins, including those for medical purposes. Thus, we cannot but admit that the resolution of such global challenges as the food, energy, ecological, and drug security is unfeasible without broad application of plants in the already existing areas of biotechnology as producers of a long list of biologically active compounds. \n\nCurrently, a large number of pharmaceutically valuable proteins are synthesized as recombinant analogs in different expression systems (Escherichia coli, yeasts, and animal cells) rather than extracted from natural sources. This makes it possible to manufacture on a commercial scale the proteins unobtainable by traditional extraction methods (for example, insulin or human growth hormone). It should be underscored that approximately 80% of recombinant pharmaceutically valuable proteins are synthesized in mammalian cell cultures [1]. Although this expression system is prevalent in the manufacture of Plants 2023, 12, 38 2 of 31 recombinant proteins, it has its own shortcomings associated with the risk of contamination with pathogens, expensiveness, formation of side products, and other problems. \n\nPlant expression systems are the most attractive for researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Advantages of plant expression systems consist of relatively inexpensive cultivation; the absence of undesirable components, such as bacterial endotoxins or hyperglycosylated target proteins, produced by yeasts; and, in contrast to animal cell cultures, the absence of animal and human pathogens. Plant cells enable correct folding and formation of intricate multimeric protein complexes as well as most of the post-translational modifications of target proteins necessary for their biological activity [2]. Plant cells are able to synthesize complex mammalian proteins, such as collagens, hemoglobin, and immunoglobulins.",

            "text": "E. coli BL21(DE3) grew up to ~50 g/L DCW in minimal medium fed only with carbon and nitrogen sources and MgSO 4 . Comparing batch cultivation (G m , S m ) with fed-batch cultivation (G f , S f ), final cell density and product titer increased ~8-fold and ~6-fold, respectively, with DAMP4/TCP decreasing of ~0.7-fold (Figures 2 and 3), but the DAMP4 production rate was only about 15% of that reported for the batch phase (Table 2). Growth rate decreased constantly as cell concentration rose during un-induced cultivation at constant feeding (Figure 3). Consistent with the observation that batch product formation rates were highest when cells were induced at \u03bc max , the induction in fed-batch during fast feeding (growth rate higher) led to a higher accumulation of DAMP4 and process time was shorter than at slow feeding. This can be explained by previous observations that E. coli exhibits both a more efficient amino acid synthesis and charging of tRNAs [51] and a more efficient energy generation [52] during recombinant protein production at fast feeding. The undesired accumulation of acetate [53] in the fed-batch experiments was moderate. A maximum of around 4 g/L could be observed, which was also consistent with the batch data. This means that in the case of DAMP4 production with BL21(DE3), we did not reach the inhibitory concentration of 5 g/L reported previously [20]. In some cases acetate remained below 1 g/L and most certainly, the ceasing of DAMP4 accumulation was not caused by acetate toxicity; indeed most acetate accumulated after peptide production stopped (Figure 3).",

            "text": "Each of the unit operations: cell production, bioreduction and product recovery constitutes a scale-up task with particular requirements. Cultivation of recombinant E. coli is generally benchmarked by the obtained recombinant protein per liter of growth medium (Schmid et al., 2001). High enzyme titers of up to 10 g/L were previously obtained from high cell density cultures (reviewed in Choi et al., 2006). One of the main problems in the scale-up of E. coli cultivation is acetate formation due to (locally) high glucose concentrations and oxygen transfer limitations. E. coli produces acetate as an extracellular co-product of the glucose overflow metabolism and, under anaerobic conditions, the mixed-acid fermentation. Acetate decelerates growth even at concentrations as low as 0.5 g/L, and it inhibits protein formation (Xu et al., 1999). Cell concentrations of up to 100 g CDW /L require hence bioreactors with high mixing efficiency, aeration with oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen, suitable nutrient feeding strategies and, furthermore, efficient cooling (Choi et al., 2006). The k L a value as a measure of gas-liquid distribution and mixing efficiency provides a useful scale-up criterion for E. coli cultivation. Optimized culture conditions obtained from microwell plates have previously shown to translate into 7.5 L and 75 L stirred tank reactors when k L a values were kept constant. Cell growth, protein expression and substrate consumption were accurately translated (Islam et al., 2008). Nutrient feeding with feedback control is widely employed for the high cell density cultivation of E. coli. pH value and oxygen concentration increase when the glucose becomes depleted. Controlling pH or dissolved oxygen and keeping it constant by feeding concentrated nutrient solution into the bioreactor provides a glucose concentration that is near zero. Overfeeding with glucose and concomitant acetic acid formation is thereby prevented. Process parameters like specific growth rates (pre-and post-induction), induction times and inducer concentrations individually affect expression of reductase and dehydrogenase in co-expression strains (Choi et al., 2006). The requirement for high and balanced expression of both activities represents an additional scale-up criterion in the biomass production Eixelsberger",

This increasing trend has contributed to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of various diseases and conditions. The production of biopharmaceuticals has largely been carried out through the genetic engineering of microbial and mammalian production platforms (Walsh 2018). Therapeutic candidates, such as AA, are generally prepared using eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell-based expression systems, such as with mammalian (e.g., CHO, HEK293), bacterial (e.g., Escherichia coli), or yeast (e.g., Pichia pastoris) cultures. These production systems have been wellestablished and improved; however, their rapid scale-up and versatility have obvious limitations. Microbial or mammalian production systems often suffer from posttranslational modifications, increased overall maintenance costs due to elaborate culture conditions, stability problems due to difficult purification processes, and the induction of immunogenicity (Arya et al. 2021). \n\nMammalian expression system are commonly used for activin A production due to their ability to perform proper protein folding, post-translational modification (PTMs), and glycosylation (Tries et al. 2001;Ying 1988). However, high production costs and complex culture conditions make efficient large-scale expansion challenging (Walsh 2018). Yeast-based expression systems provide an alternative eukaryotic platform, but they tend to produce hyperglycosylated proteins, which can affect the biological activity and stability of the protein (Gupta and Shukla 2018). \n\nOne alternative for overcoming these challenges is the use of plant-based expression systems, such as applications with plant molecular farming that utilizes the advantages of plant expression to mass-produce recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins. Fisher et al. introduced the concept of molecular farming, or \"biopharming\", to produce recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins in plants (Fischer et al. 1999). This approach utilizes the inherent capabilities of plants to function as safe and cost-effective factories for the production of therapeutic proteins, making it a highly useful alternative for addressing some of the issues associated with microbial or mammalian production systems.",

So far, no reports of industrial-scale continuous production of biopharmaceuticals using bacterial expression systems exist. The most-often-cited reasons for this are the genetic instabilities of the bacterial strains and recombinant plasmid leading to higher cell heterogeneity, the formation of inclusion bodies, and the increased acetate toxicity through overflow metabolism. Additionally, an increased metabolic burden which leads to lower growth rates and protein yield, and eventually increased cell death, as well as challenges of maintaining sterility, are also reported [10]. \n\nPrevious studies have focused on quantifying the metabolic load associated with recombinant protein production [11,12] and determining the growth and protein production kinetics to optimise operating conditions and devise control strategies for the bioreactor [9]. High throughput techniques, including miniaturisation and parallelisation of bioreactors are used in both industry and research. Cascade operation and multistage culture that decouples the growth from the protein production stage have been investigated with promising results, combined with adequate induction strategies for protein expression [13,14]. \n\nThe advances in continuous protein production using E. coli were recently summarised in [15], focusing on the knowledge transfer opportunities from fed-batch to continuous operation. One exciting development is using glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a substrate to make the RPP more sustainable [16][17][18]. Although there is an increased interest in the transition from fed-batch to continuous processing with E coli, the heterogeneity of the culture and the lack of stable production are considered obstacles [15,19]. Highthroughput single-cell expressions studies are required for understanding the dynamics and performance of heterogenous cell populations [20]. \n\nThis work uses a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, to test the recombinant protein expression in an E. coli strain with industrial relevance in glucose and glycerol-limited chemostats.",

            "text": "Several studies have reported high-cell-density cultivation (>100 g/L DCW) of recombinant E. coli by supplying pure oxygen to prevent acetate accumulation [25,26]; however, the high cost and safety risks associated with pure oxygen lead to challenges in the scale-up of this process for industrial applications. Herein, an efficient fermentation process without supplying pure oxygen was developed for the mass production of recombinant E. coli. A 20% air saturation was maintained by decreasing the cultivation temperature during fed-batch cultivation and increasing the agitation speed. The acetic acid concentration during the entire cultivation period could be sustained effectively at less than 1.5 g/L, and a cell density of 30.2 g/L DCW was obtained after 30 h of cultivation under the optimal culture conditions. The efficiency of peocin expression was estimated by IPTG induction at different growth phases. Regardless of induction time, the cell mass was significantly lower than that without IPTG induction due to the metabolic burden of peocin expression. Thus, the lowest cell mass and highest peocin expression level were obtained when induction was carried out at the early exponential phase. Although a relatively high biomass was obtained by induction at the late exponential phase, cells at high density may exhibit response to various forms of stress, such as nutritional deficiency, accumulation of metabolic waste, and osmotic pressure imbalance, harming the expression of recombinant proteins [26]. Therefore, a relatively low peocin expression level was obtained by induction at the middle or late exponential phase. In the present study, the maximum amount of peocin produced was approximately 3 g/L (32.1% of total protein) when cells were induced at the early exponential phase. Although certain bacteriocins have been cloned and expressed in E. coli, the present study is the first to report mass production of bacteriocin by fed-batch cultivation without pure oxygen supplementation. \n\nA simple and effective purification process is an important and critical factor for acquisition of enough recombinant protein and to achieve scale-up goals in industry.",

            "text": "Therapeutic proteins are major structural and regulatory molecules essential for a normal functioning of the human body. Part of recombinant proteins that are small in size and do not require additional modifications are produced in the most economical bioreactor -E.coli cells. However, the production of proteins in bacteria is associated with a number of limitations: disrupted folding of some proteins, absence of crucial modifications, and the inability to produce larger molecules [1,2]. Some of these limitations are avoided when using yeast cells, which can produce high-quality recombinant proteins at sufficiently low cost. However, many recombinant human proteins require specific modifications that can only be obtained in higher eukaryotic cells [3]. Therefore, nowadays there is an increasing number of drugs obtained from mammalian cell cultures grown in bioreactors, mostly Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [4,5]. CHO cells were first isolated in 1957 [6]. It soon became evident that these cells are ideal for biomass scaling during the generation of recombinant proteins at the bioreactor level, since they are undemanding vis-a-vis growth conditions. Several lines were obtained from the initial clone of CHO cells, among which the C\u041dO-K1 line became the most commonly used [7]. Optimal conditions for providing high REVIEWS linear DNA into the nucleus results in the activation of reparation systems that provide cross-linking of linear DNA ends through two main mechanisms: homologous recombination and ligation of nonhomologous DNA ends [9][10][11]. As a result, long linear DNA molecules are formed bearing several copies of the vector construct capable of integrating into the genome with some probability. Linear DNA can integrate a genomic region that already contains other copies of the same DNA through the mechanism of homologous recombination, which leads to an increase in the copy number of the construct integrated in a specific genomic site [12]. Thus, one genomic site can bear up to several hundreds of integrated copies of a vector construct. \n\nIn order to enhance the producing capacity of clones, selective increase in the number of construct copies, which results in target protein expression, is used in industrial biotechnology [8].",

            "text": "Wild-type microorganisms have evolved for millions of years, thereby optimizing their internal metabolism to achieve maximal growth rates. This tightly regulated metabolism guarantees a maximal carbon flux towards growth. Within this complex network of regulated pathways, a vast array of molecules are produced that ensure growth and survival in all kinds of conditions. A lot of these molecules have proven to be interesting to humankind, such as lactic acid, penicillin, ethanol and 2,3-butanediol [1,2]. Additionally, with the rise of targeted genetic engineering in the 1980s, the range of possibilities of these microorganisms for industrial biotechnology purposes increased rapidly. With this innovative technology, existing pathways can be tweaked and new pathways introduced. However, when scientists start engineering a microorganism, they interfere with its tightly regulated carbon flux, resulting in suboptimal growth (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the introduced or engineered pathways can cause stress or even toxicity for the host [3]. For example, the expression of the mevalonatedependent pathway in Escherichia coli, responsible for the production of terpenoids, leads to ceased growth or spontaneous mutations due to the toxic accumulation of isoprenoid precursors [4]. When overexpressing recombinant proteins, this production drains energy and protein synthesis machinery from the cell, thereby affecting its metabolism resulting in ceased growth or even \"viable, but non-culturable\" cells, which are no longer capable of dividing [5]. The reduced growth rates that are associated with this competition or toxicity cause lower volumetric productivity (g.L \u22121 .h \u22121 ) and lower final product titers (g.L \u22121 ). Consequently, to obtain the desired production levels, a longer fermentation run and larger fermenter are required, leading to higher fermentation costs. Alternatively, the production can be optimized by further metabolic engineering or optimization of the fermentation parameters, such as temperature [6][7][8]. Nevertheless, these strategies can become quite laborintensive and do not guarantee an increase in volumetric productivity (g.L \u22121 .h \u22121 ) and/or product titers (g.L \u22121 ).",

With the use of an optimized vector, exponentially growing cultures could be condensed 40-fold without affecting protein yields, which lowered sample labeling costs to a few percent of the cost of a typical labeling experiment. Because the host cells were completely growth-arrested, toxic amino acids such as selenomethionine and fluorophenylalanine were efficiently incorporated into recombinant proteins in the absence of cytotoxicity.

The K-12 and B strains of E. coli with their variants are among the most widely used host cells in biological research and industrial fermentation (Marisch et al., 2013), whereby E. coli K-12 strains are more widely used in genetic manipulation and biochemical research (Kuhnert et al., 1995;Posfai et al., 2006). According to Northern blot analysis, the mRNA expression level of the E. coli B strain is higher than in the K-12 strain (Shiloach et al., 2000;Phue and Shiloach, 2004). Furthermore, E. coli B strains, which lack genes for flagella production and express the motility-related proteins at a relatively low level, can achieve a higher biomass yield and faster growth than E. coli K-12 strains (Yu et al., 2002;Shiloach et al., 2010). Previous studies have investigated the differences between E. coli B and K-12 strains by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches (Marisch et al., 2013), as well as metabolomic analysis (Shiloach et al., 2010). \n\nIn vitro protein synthesis, CFPS provides high flexibility and controllability.

In contrast to the complexity and limitations of living cells, the functional performance of genetic elements can be rapidly validated and screened from libraries using in vitro platforms, such as PURE (Shimizu et al., 2001) and lysatebased systems (Kightlinger et al., 2018).",

A variety of protein expression systems are available, but nowadays almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cell lines due to their complex structure and glycosylation requirements. However, production of clinical-grade antibodies in mammalian cells is very expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is known to be the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective recombinant expression system, which usually achieves higher protein yields than mammalian cells. Indeed, it is one of the most popular host in the industry for the expression of recombinant proteins. In this work, a trivalent single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based N-terminal trimerbody, specific for native laminin-111, was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in E. coli. Mammalian and bacterially produced anti-laminin trimerbody molecules display comparable functional and structural properties, although importantly the yield of trimerbody expressed in E. coli was considerably higher than in human cells. These results demonstrated that E. coli is a versatile and efficient expression system for multivalent trimerbody-based molecules that is suitable for their industrial production.",

Our K-12 (wild-type) strain cultures reached good cell densities and high protein yields: purified GH1 and IL-6 were around 1 g/L, while purified scFv IgA 1 productivity reached 139 mg/L and avidin 71 mg/L, using two different standard starting fermentation protocols i.e. without protein specific optimization. In the case of the scFv IgA 1 the glucose concentration was high through the fermentation and that may have repressed protein production. Protein and strain specific process optimization is likely to both increase the cell densities and protein productivity. To our knowledge this is the first report showing the efficient production of disulfide bond containing proteins in the cytoplasm of E.coli in chemically defined minimal media and our non-optimized yields of up to 1 g/L suggest it has potential industrial as well as academic use. \n\nOur results contrast with the available data on soluble protein production in a bioreactor system in the cytoplasm of commercial available \u0394trxB/\u0394gor strains such as SHuffle or Origami. For example, Chung et al. [22] used SHuffle strain in fed-batch fermentation with rich media for the production of giant grouper growth hormone, however the protein was produced only in the form of inclusion bodies. Similarly Br\u00fcsehaber et al. [23] used the Origami strain with rich media for the production of pig liver esterase, but no soluble protein was obtained from fed-batch fermentation, only from batch fermentations. Lamppa et al. [24] were able to employ the SHuffle strain in fermentation for production of human lysozyme, however they managed to obtain soluble lysozyme only after co-expression of additional folding chaperones, Skp and Trigger factor resulting in the production of 21 mg/L of soluble lysozyme, far below the protein production levels reported here.",

            "text": "In this work, we tested three E. coli strains, a S. cerevisiae strain and a human suspension cell culture for PrimPol production. \n\nDue to simplicity of expression and purification procedures, high protein production levels and low costs of cell cultivation, protein expression in E. coli is the most common way for recombinant protein production. However, the lack of eukaryotic post-translation machinery and rapid protein accumulation can sometimes promote misfolding of eukaryotic proteins, resulting in loss of their biochemical activity [28,29]. A common alleviation of rapid protein accumulation can be achieved by lowering the temperature of cultivation, which slows down the rate of folding, thereby decreasing the hydrophobic interactions involved in protein selfaggregation and often improving the solubilization of the protein [30]. Another strategy to prevent protein aggregation and to increase the catalytic activity of eukaryotic enzymes is the co-expression of target protein with chaperons [29,31]. With these considerations in mind, we carried out the production of human PrimPol in three different E. coli strains. BL21 is the most common host strain as it enables high-level recombinant protein expression. Rosetta 2-pRARE is BL21-derivative strain expressing tRNAs for seven codons rarely used in bacteria and designed to enhance the expression of eukaryotic proteins. ArcticExpress(DE3)-pRIL strain contains extra copies of tRNA genes for rare E. coli codons and also encodes the coldadapted chaperons Cpn10 and Cpn60, which aid in protein folding at low temperatures. In our experiments, all strains provided good yield of human PrimPol with similar DNA polymerase activities, indicating that additional tRNAs for rarely used codons, low temperature of expression and co-expression with chaperones are not necessary for production of active PrimPol protein. \n\nEukaryotic expression systems offer some advantages for human recombinant proteins production. In this work, we for the first time report the production of full-length human PrimPol from yeast and human cells. For instance, many human DNA polymerases (e.g.",

            "text": "Globally, there is a significant demand for the production of recombinant proteins due to their diversified properties in various applications, such as diagnosis, therapeutics, and industrial uses. Recombinant proteins are expressed in various hosts, such as bacteria (Swartz, 2001;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009), yeast (Mattanovich et al., 2012;Kim et al., 2015), mammalian cells (Hacker and Balasubramanian, 2016;O'Flaherty et al., 2020), and plants (Mason and Arntzen, 1995;Cramer et al., 2000;Shanmugaraj et al., 2020a;Shanmugaraj and Phoolcharoen, 2021). Each expression system has its own advantages, disadvantages, and certain limitations, such as the availability of resources, inability to undergo molecular modifications, and requirement of sophisticated tools and techniques, resulting in toxic by-products and contamination risks (Barrera and Mayfield, 2013;Corchero et al., 2013). In the last decade, plants have emerged as an alternate platform for the expression of various functional recombinant proteins that have high therapeutic uses, with decreased manufacturing costs that are still in the pipeline for commercialization due to certain concerns related to environmental contamination, allergic reactions, and slow growth cycles (Salazar-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2015). Recombinant protein scale-ups in a safer way have drawn major attention to meet the current demand, with a focus on achieving higher quality and yields at mitigated production costs, thereby ensuring global coverage (Shanmugaraj and Phoolcharoen, 2021). \n\nMicroalgae comprise a diverse group of organisms with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic nature, making them an archetypal platform for recombinant technology.",

            "text": "Thus, the risk of false positives or negatives using estimations made by machine learning is still a concern. Glu, Ala, Phe, Ile, Lys, and Asp increased the cell and GFP yields, and Leu, Ser, Thr, Asn, Val, and Tyr decreased the cell and GFP yields (Figure 5). Chow et al. also reported that in recombinant E. coli BLR(DE3), Asn, Asp, Gln, and Glu increased the production of elastin-like polypeptides, which are recombinant peptide-based biopolymers that contain repetitive sequences enriched in Gly, Val, Pro, and Ala (Chow et al., 2006). In this study, Glu and Asp, but not Asn, increased the expression of GFP. These results may indicate that E. coli behaviors in the rich medium were varied compared with its activity in the basal media under standard culture conditions. \n\nKumar et al. also reported that 20 mixed amino acids with chemically defined media increased recombinant peptide production by 40% in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Kumar et al., 2020). Generally, the addition of amino acids to the growth medium can influence E. coli protein expression. In a rich medium, E. coli cells grow faster, and the expression of the majority of the translation apparatus genes is significantly elevated. This is consistent with known patterns of growth rate-dependent regulation and an increased rate of protein synthesis in rapidly growing cells. The behavior in minimal cells would be controlled by the biosynthesis of building blocks, such as de novo biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleotides (Baez et al., 2019;Tao et al., 1999). However, the effects of individual amino acids in a rich medium have not been sufficiently studied, and surprisingly, there is no common consensus today. Therefore, many engineers associated with industrial production are forced to screen for the best raw materials, such as different brands and lots of yeast extracts, because they have no information on the significant components in the raw materials.",

            "text": "Background Escherichia coli is one of the most important hosts for production of recombinant proteins in biopharmaceutical industry. However, when selecting a suitable production strain, it is often not considered that a lot of different sub-species exist, which can differ in their genotypes and phenotypes. Another important development step is the scale-up of bioprocesses with the particular challenge that heterogeneities and gradients occur at production scale. These in turn can affect the production organism and can have negative impact on the process and the product quality. Therefore, researchers developed scale-down reactors, which are used to mimic manufacturing conditions in laboratory scale. The main objectives of this study were to determine the extent to which scale-related process inhomogeneities affect the misincorporation of non-canonical amino acids into the recombinant target protein, which is an important quality attribute, and whether strain specific properties may have an impact. Results We investigated two industrially relevant E. coli strains, BL21(DE3) and HMS174(DE3), which produced an antigen binding fragment (Fab). The cells were cultivated in high cell density fed-batch mode at laboratory scale and under scale-down conditions. We demonstrated that the two host strains differ significantly with respect to norleucine misincorporation into the target protein, especially under heterogeneous cultivation conditions in the scale-down reactor. No norleucine misincorporation was observed in E. coli BL21(DE3) for either cultivation condition. In contrast, norleucine incorporation into HMS174(DE3) was already detectable in the reference process and increased dramatically in scale-down experiments. Norleucine incorporation was not random and certain positions were preferred over others, even though only a single codon exists. Differences in biomass and Fab production between the strains during scale-down cultivations could be observed as well. Conclusions This study has shown that E. coli BL21(DE3) is much more robust to scale-up effects in terms of norleucine misincorporation than the K12 strain tested. In this respect, BL21(DE3) enables better transferability of results at different scales, simplifies process implementation",

Transgenic animals can produce several valuable biopharmaceuticals, such as vaccines, antibodies, and other biotherapeutics [171,172]. Advances in molecular biology have been the primary guiding factor in the biopharmaceutical production of such substances and the development of high levels of protein. \n\nIn conclusion, significant progress has been observed in many technical aspects of gene expression in E. coli and yeast.

            "text": "Over the past two decades yeasts have emerged as efficient production host for recombinant protein production. At the end of 2018, about 16.7% of all approved biopharmaceutical proteins were produced using yeasts as expression system, among them Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella sp.) as the major players. 1,2 P. pastoris has already been proven repeatedly to allow high level recombinant protein production. 3,4,5,6  is known from literature that recombinant protein production causes a metabolic burden on cellular metabolism. The phenotype of cells producing recombinant proteins can be a decreased growth rate, decreased biomass formation, and overall decreased cell fitness. 7 e term \"metabolic burden\" is defined as portion of the host cell's resources, either in form of energy or precursor metabolites such as amino acids and nucleotides, which is required to maintain and express foreign DNA. 8 A possible explanation for such a metabolic burden can be the limited synthesis capacity of amino acids or the limited supply with precursors for amino acid biosynthesis. Also, a higher energy demand due to recombinant protein production can be an explanation. Indeed, physiological studies of P. pastoris in recombinant protein production conditions indicate a re-distribution of intracellular carbon fluxes toward the TCA-cycle and ATP production. 9,10,11,12 deed, the addition of amino acids to the cultivation media proved to be a valuable strategy to unburden cellular metabolism. 13 Heyland et al. 7 revealed that in particular the addition of energetically expensive amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) or glutamate increased the production of recombinant \u03b2-aminopeptidase in P. pastoris. The amino acid uptake in supplemented cultures also correlated with the energetic costs of synthesizing those amino acids. \n\nIn a focused study on the intracellular amino acid levels during production of recombinant Fab fragments, Carnicer et al. 14 reported an increase for some intracellular amino acids compared to a control strain.",

            "text": "It has been established that in response to high dissolved oxygen of 300% air saturation, E. coli activates the SoxRS regulon which activates the transcription of the soxS and the sodA genes [1]. The sodA gene encodes the manganesesuperoxide dismutase (SOD), which reduces the oxidative stress caused by molecular oxygen, allowing the cells to grow uninterrupted at 300% oxygen [2,3]. Baez et al. [1] showed that in response to high oxygen concentrations, soxS expression is increased 16 fold, making it a possible candidate for inducing recombinant protein expression in response to high oxygen concentrations. Expression of recombinant proteins is often achieved by coupling the recombinant protein gene to promoters of genes that are activated in response to the presence or absence of a specific factor. Among the known examples for such couplings are the expression systems of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, where the heterologous gene is coupled to the methanol-activated AOX1 promoter [4]; the glucose-depletion activated expression system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]; and the arabinose inducible ara P BAD promoter in, E. coli, [6]. The activation of the soxS gene by increasing dissolved oxygen levels could be an additional way for expressing recombinant proteins from E. coli without affecting cell growth or metabolism since it does not rely on starvation stress induced by nitrogen, phosphate, or amino acids limitation [7]. Expression of recombinant proteins using high oxygen concentration has attractive properties such as precise control of the induction timing and the elimination of the inducer in the final product or the waste effluents of the bioprocess, making this strategy potentially suitable for production of pharmaceutical-grade proteins [8]. In this report, we describe the expression of recombinant green fluorescent protein from E. coli by using the soxS promoter and molecular oxygen as an inducer. The expression was compared to other induction procedure and the effect of oxygen on bacterial growth and protein integrity was evaluated.",

            "text": "Large-scale culturing of microorganisms possessing biochemical pathways for desired products has enabled production of compounds such as enzymes, alcohols, amino acids, antibiotics, organic acids, and other biologically active compounds in quantities that might otherwise have been very difficult to obtain from natural sources or by chemical synthesis.Lately, new constructs of microbial production strains are being devised to even secrete the recombinant proteins 1 .As the products mature, process economics demands increasing volumetric productivity (i.e., production per unit volume per unit time; a product of active cell density and the specific cell productivity), which is a major goal of modern bioprocesses [2][3][4] .While metabolic engineering and regulation of biochemical pathways are utilized to increase specific cell productivity [5][6][7] , high-density cultivations are designed to achieve high product concentrations in broth via growing cells to high densities while maintaining high specific cell productivity.As a result, high-density cultivation (HDC) has become an important tool in modern bi-oprocessing.This review concerns with the different issues involved in HDC of microorganisms.\n\nHigh cell density is a relative term and no exact concentration of dry cell weight is considered representative of the process.In general, cell concentrations an order of magnitude or more than those achieved in conventional cultivation processes have been considered as high cell densities 8 .Per Tapia et al. 8 , cell concentration in the order of 10 7 cells mL -1 is representative of high cell density.On the other hand, other studies have used dry cell weight densities ranging from 20 g L -1 9 to 50 g L - 1 10 , and as high as to 200 g L - 1 11 and 300 g L - 1 12 , to designate a high-density cultivation.\n\nIn the same note, although HDC research was initially mostly concerned with cultivation of Escherichia coli 7,[13][14][15][16][17] , high cell densities have been achieved with several other organisms as well with improved product accumulation.",

Subsequently, the efficiency of conventional polySia production was compared with a recombinant approach using the engineered laboratory safety strain E. coli BL21 to avoid large-scale production of \u03b12,8and \u03b12,9-polySia in pathogenic bacteria. The produced polySia was then purified using a validated process and characterized in detail by HPLC analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.",

            "text": "Background Precise regulation of gene expression is of utmost importance for the production of complex membrane proteins (MP), enzymes or other proteins toxic to the host cell. In this article we show that genes under control of a normally Isopropyl \u03b2- d -1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible P T7-lacO promoter can be induced solely with l -arabinose in a newly constructed Escherichia coli expression host BL21-AI< gp2 >, a strain based on the recently published approach of bacteriophage inspired growth-decoupled recombinant protein production. Results Here, we show that BL21-AI< gp2 > is able to precisely regulate protein production rates on a cellular level in an l -arabinose concentration-dependent manner and simultaneously allows for reallocation of metabolic resources due to l -arabinose induced growth decoupling by the phage derived inhibitor peptide Gp2. We have successfully characterized the system under relevant fed-batch like conditions in microscale cultivation (800\u00a0\u00b5L) and generated data proofing a relevant increase in specific yields for 6 different Escherichia coli derived MP-GFP fusion proteins by using online-GFP signals, FACS analysis, SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Conclusions In all cases tested, BL21-AI< gp2 > outperformed the parental strain BL21-AI, operated in growth-associated production mode. Specific MP-GFP fusion proteins yields have been improved up to 2.7-fold. Therefore, this approach allows for fine tuning of MP production or expression of multi-enzyme pathways where e.g. particular stoichiometries have to be met to optimize product flux.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a microorganism that is one of the earliest hosts and extremely useful for production of heterologous proteins with commercial interest at large scale for structural and functional studies. 77,78 E. coli genetics are far better understood than those of other microorganisms. Advanced genetic tools convert this bacterium to a valuable host for expression of complex eukaryotic proteins. Moreover, ability of rapid growth, high expression level, avoidance of incorporation of amino acid analogs, formation of intracellular disulfide bonds, alteration of metabolic carbon flow and cheapness are the other advantages of this system. 56,79 O'Reilly et al. used E. coli expression system beside the insect expression system, for the first time. They obtained insoluble murine recombinant endostatin and compared this protein with native form derived from collagen XVIII and recombinant protein that was expressed in insect expression system. They declared that the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation was similar in all of the three derived forms. More than 99% of the protein derived from E. coli was insoluble and lost during centrifugation. 11 Generally, protein concentration and the pH of refolding buffer are very essential factors in the refolding process of recombinant proteins. 80 In this point, for overcoming the production of insoluble rEs, You et al. designed an applied new method for refolding and purification of murine endostatin in E. coli system for the first time in 1999. For this purpose, they refolded the protein in the presence of chaotrophic agent (urea and guanidine-Hcl) and redox-coupling reagents such as glutathione. This protein was comparable to the one obtained from the use of Yeast-expression system in physiochemical properties and also in anti-angiogenic activities. 81 In another study, production of soluble recombinant murine endostatin was the main aim of study. A purification method was developed by Huang et al. in order to production of an effective and soluble rEs.

            "text": "The lower rate of protein synthesis here was probably due to a lower translation rate since the lower substrate uptake rate resulted in a smaller amount of ribosomes. The total protein production was not however impaired since a longer cultivation time led to the same amount of protein accumulation. The great benefits of the system were less proteolytic degradation of the protein and less inclusion body formation. The relatively slower synthesis rate of the recombinant protein is thus important for the quality of the protein product, and it seems to be particularly important in the production of membrane proteins which are preferably produced in a soluble membrane fraction [7]. \n\nDuring the development of new pharmaceutical drugs, one of the goals is to rapidly deliver small soluble quantities of a large number of proteins and protein variants for further studies of their structure and function in relation to disease control. To avoid bottlenecks, the most favorable conditions are chosen with respect to expression system and medium. In order to screen a number of different proteins, production takes place in a multiparallel unsupervised format (HTP, High Throughput Protein production) which leads to uncontrolled process conditions with respect to important parameters such as pH, acetic acid production and oxygenation, and therefore to low cell densities and low product concentrations. No variation in the production scheme can be allowed and all clones are induced simultaneously and are harvested at the same time, which means that the cultivation time for all the cells is the same. \n\nThe development of a commercial protein production process, on the other hand, allows the measurement and control of a number of parameters, resulting in a range of actions that can be taken to increase the productivity and to keep important parameters constant. The process is carefully sampled and optimized during the process development. The most important control technique used is the fed-batch technique, which allows the accumulation of high cell densities but also the metabolic control of acetic acid production. This is achieved by operator control of the supply of the glucose which is fed to the cultivation, in order to restrict the glucose uptake by the individual cell.",

            "text": "2.1. Recombinant Expression in Escherichia coli. The target protein is usually recombinantly overexpressed in different host systems, for example, bacteria, yeast, insect, mammalian cells, or cell-free expression systems [12]. The bacteria approach is very robust and easy to work with as compared to other systems. Thus, it is probably always the first choice to be tested, if the expressed protein is active without posttranslational modifications. The recombinant expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is introduced in the following section. \n\nFigure 1 shows the flowchart of overexpression of the target proteins. The target protein gene is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then the PCR product is ligated with the selected commercial vectors (such as the pET system from Novagen and the pBAD system from Invitrogen). The plasmids harboring the gene of interest are transformed into the competent E. coli cells by either chemical preparation or electroporation. Chemically prepared competent cells are more widely used and work well in most cases for penetration of the plasmids. Expression of the target proteins is usually started from the cells grown in one single colony. The culture is grown until it reaches a certain phase. Afterwards, it is induced to produce the target protein by certain chemicals depending on the choice of the plasmids and strains. All factors, for example, choices of plasmids, strains, expression conditions, and fusion tags, affect the yield of the production, which further influence the down streamed purification and crystallization steps. Only the choice of strains and expression conditions are discussed here. A more complete discussion of the factors can be found elsewhere (e.g., [13]). \n\n(A) Strain. Many different strains exist and they have their own advantages. For membrane protein, C41 and C43 (both from the BL21DE3 strain) should be considered, since these derivatives not only have a slower transcription level [14,15], but also increase the size of the area to possibly accommodate a larger amount of target proteins [16]. The original BL21DE3 and the newly designed Lemo21DE3 strains [14] are worth testing as well.",

Recombinant protein products of importance generally include growth factors and hormones, antibodies, enzymes and vaccines (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). The market of recombinant proteins is forecasted to grow at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of between 9.8 and 12.2% (VynZ Research, 2019;MarketsandMarket Inc., 2021). Among those products, growth factors and hormones have the largest market share; growth factors are signaling proteins that regulate cellular processes involving proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and angiogenesis. Recombinant growth factors have been conventionally used as therapeutics for wound healing and diseases, and they increasingly serve as cosmetic additives and as a supplement in serum-free media for cultivated meats (Kim et al., 2021;O'Neill et al., 2021). In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has called on efforts on the development of recombinant protein-based vaccines and therapies. Emerging data suggest that recombinant protein vaccines potentially complement the mRNA and viral vector vaccines (Pollet et al., 2021). \n\nThere is a pressing need to design economically sustainable processes to achieve efficient recombinant protein production (RPP). Bacterial expression systems are commonly employed to address this issue because their genomes are relatively simple to manipulate, they can be cultured in cost-effective media, and the production scheme is easily scalable (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;MarketsandMarket Inc., 2021). Large-scale production of many recombinant proteins remains challenging, especially for those with multiple disulfide bonds or from mammalian origins. The precursor metabolites and energy required to fuel cellular activity and protein biosynthesis come from central metabolic pathways (Papagianni, 2012). However, RPP often perturbs cell physiology as a result of imbalanced carbon flux, energy drain, and impaired global regulation in central and cellular metabolism.",

The growing demand for a new therapeutic and commercial recombinant proteins pro-voked a rapid development of a large number of commercially available prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems and hosts.\n\nGenerally it is the aim to get the target protein within a short time in sufficient amounts and quality, i.e. in the native folded state. Although successful for a large number of proteins, often the overexpression of recombinant genes in the common host Escherichia coli results in aggregation [1], or even no product is accumulated due to degradation. Despite the availability of a large number of host strains, cloning vectors, fusion and coexpression partners, the optimisation procedure may be long-lasting and highly dependent on the experiences of the performing scientist or team.\n\nRecommendations for \"first to try\" strategies based on the experience from tens of thousands of proteins [2] may be a good guide, however, unfortunately, such strategies often fail for secreted or more complex proteins. In this case often step by step optimisation is performed, starting either with shake flasks or with multiwell plates. The latter ones provide the possibility to evaluate in parallel a large number of conditions (see e.g. [3]). Recent developments provide even the option for on line monitoring of cultivation parameters such as pH, oxygen, or cell density [4][5][6][7][8].\n\nProduct yield and degree of aggregation depend on a number of factors which are highly interconnected. Strength of transcriptional induction and ribosome binding efficiency are strongly related to environmental parameters, such as the actual medium composition, the external pH and the growth temperature which also effect the specific growth rate and, overflow metabolism, i.e. acetate production. Environmental conditions rapidly change in shaken batch systems due to the exponential biomass increase and the inability control these factors, which provides variation between cultures; a problem which has been extensively discussed [2].\n\nFurthermore, results from multiwell plate of shake flask optimisation studies are often not directly transferable to bioreactor scale cultures and industrial production, where the aim is to boost",

            "text": "It has long been known that heterologous expression in plasmidbased E. coli systems has a grave impact on cell physiology, widely known as a metabolic burden. [30] This burden arises from limitations in resource allocation between vegetative biomass and recombinant protein and is often associated with a decrease in growth rate and ultimately cell lysis. [31,32] In the X-press strain, the metabolic burden may be reduced by decoupling cell proliferation from recombinant protein production. It was shown that Gp2 expression alone, independent of plasmid-based protein expression, reduces Y X/S in fed-batch cultivation up to 55% [21] and therefore mitigates the effect of recombinant protein production on growth. In our study, we assessed the impact of the selected process parameters on growth by measuring Y X/S . In the X-press strain, Y X/S was reduced by half from 0.39 in the uninduced state to levels between 0.17 and 0.20 during the production of SpA in cultivation 25/0.13 (Figure 2A). Under the same conditions, growth of BL21(DE3) was less affected and Y X/S was only reduced from 0.38 to 0.28. Reduced growth in the X-press strain compared to BL21(DE3) can be attributed to growth repression by Gp2. Y X/S was further reduced in both strains with increasing temperature and q S,0 to 30/0.25 (Figure 2B), as well as only increasing temperature to 35/0.13 (Figure 2C). In BL21(DE3), this is probably caused by the higher metabolic load of SpA expression, while elevated Gp2 expression in the X-press strain might additionally have decreased Y X/S . The effect of different cultivation conditions on growth was much stronger in BL21(DE3), with distinct temperature dependence. This behaviour might stem from an increase in target gene transcript levels competing with host mRNA at elevated temperatures. [33,34] Contrarily, repressing host RNA polymerase activity in the X-press strain greatly mitigated the effect of different parameter settings on growth.",

As seven volume changes in a steady-state recombinant protein production in single-vessel E. coli cultivations are regarded as a steady-state (Vemuri et al., 2006), studies in this field are tricky to implement, as cultivations might suffer from unexpected metabolic shifts before reaching a \"steady-state\" mode. Characterizing intracellular fluxes via a metabolome analysis indicates a high diversity occurring between different strains (Basan, 2018;McCloskey et al., 2018). The metabolome analysis state, which we use to deal with a highly complex system as different intracellular pathways are up-or downregulated, is very dependent on the host and the target protein (McCloskey et al., 2018). As shifts already occur without RPP, showing that cells try to adapt to the environment in chemostat cultivation, we hypothesize that the production of recombinant proteins will increase these shifts to a maximum.",

            "text": "Another approach, which has shown successful results, is that of extracellular production of recombinant proteins. This has the twin advantages of continuous production of target proteins since there is no disruption of the cell wall and improved yield due to low proteolytic digestion. Extracellular secretion of heterologous proteins can be facilitated in a number of ways. Since E. coli does not secrete proteins into the environment except for some defence proteins and lysins, protein production in the extracellular space is directed using physical, chemical or genetic methods. In the first case, harvested cells are subjected to osmotic or mechanical stress using chemicals or biochemicals or enzymes, which disrupt the outer membrane of the bacterial cell. The concentration of the agents used needs to be carefully regulated so that cell lysis does not occur and purity and/or yield of the target protein are not compromised. Chemicals like polyethylene glycol, Triton, EDTA, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ have been used for the extracellular production of different proteins (Zhang et al., 2009;Wiese and Schmitz, 2011). Mechanical means like sonication are used quite commonly. Doubts have however been raised about the feasibility of scaling up such a process as it requires handling large volumes of the culture medium. \n\nA second method, which finds widespread use in the laboratory, is the creation of gene fusion of the target protein with outer membrane proteins (OmpA, OmpF, OsmY) (Jeong and Lee, 2002;Zhang et al., 2006). After optimization of a variety of promoters and growth conditions, a high throughput system was employed to harvest a number of human proteins from the extracellular space using the OsmY fusion tag under the control of the araBAD promoter (Kotzsch et al., 2011). The Haemolysin (HlyA) transport system (HlyB-HlyD-TolA translocator) utilizes a protein channel running through the inner and outer membranes of E. coli (Gentschev et al., 2002). The toxin is secreted in the extracellular environment due to the presence of the secretory signal sequence.",

            "text": "Compared to some other systems for the production of recombinant proteins, TrB is the most attractive model because they are powerful tools to meet the growing demand for therapeutic recombinant proteins. The main advantage of using TrB is a low cost of obtaining valuable complex human therapeutic proteins in easily accessible fluids. Using the constructions of tissue-specific expression, large quantities of human recombinant proteins can be expressed and produced in the extracellular space, urine, seminal plasma, milk, and blood of large transgenic animals. \n\nProteins derived from TrB have a number of advantages compared to proteins from some other sources. First of all, the use of TrB for protein production can reduce the level of contamination of food with such contaminants as: HIV and viral hepatitis, compared to the level of contamination of proteins isolated directly from human blood. It would avoid such tragedies as the infection of hemophilia patients in Europe and Japan with HIV through the drugs based on donated blood. \n\nThe second important advantage of obtaining recombinant proteins using transgenic animals is the high safety of the activity of the native protein. The ability of transgenic animals to produce complex biologically active proteins in an efficient and economical way surpasses such capabilities in bacteria, mammalian cells, transgenic plants, and insects (Houdebine 2009). As we know, bacteria are limited in their ability to perform post-translational modifications that are required for many proteins (Balbas 2001;Swartz 2001). It is due to bacteria, because they cannot add carbohydrates to polypeptide chains and cannot generate the required proteins in their mature native structure. TrB mammary glands perform post-translational modifications of protein, such as: carboxylation, glycosylation, and amidation, which are useful for the full biological activity of many proteins (Houdebine 1995;Houdebine 2000). The use of eukaryotic cells (the cultured cells of mammals) in some cases helps overcome these problems. However, the cultivation of animal cells on an industrial scale is a very expensive technology. when compared with chemical synthesis, the production of therapeutically active peptides in the milk of transgenic animals also have a large number of advantages.",

            "text": "The market for recombinant pharmaceutical proteins is expanding rapidly. Indeed, nearly all pharmaceutical companies with a market capitalization value of more than $US 10 billion report that their revenue share from such products is growing faster than the share from small-molecule drugs [1]. The industry has focused on a small number of production platforms based on the bacterium Escherichia coli, several species of yeast, and a selection of insect and mammalian cell lines, which have been developed and improved in line with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). However, focusing on a small number of platforms means that the unique requirements of certain target proteins are difficult to meet; this is the case of recombinant proteins that are required in small quantities (e.g., for individual patients) or in massive quantities or that need rapid production scale-up. Plant biotechnology can overcome some of these limitations and the potential of plant-based platforms for the flexible, low-cost production of high-quality, bioactive recombinant proteins is well-documented [2]. \n\nPlants successfully perform the majority of posttranslational modifications required for the activity of complex eukaryotic proteins and provide tremendous flexibility in terms of scale, cost, safety, and regulatory issues. For example, cell-based bioreactor systems including plant suspension cells and algae are ideal for lower-volume products, whereas field-grown commodity crops can produce metric tons of recombinant protein at highly competitive costs. Contained production systems based on plants have biosafety advantages over microbial and mammalian production platforms because they neither do produce endotoxins nor do they support the growth of pathogens that infect animals, thus reducing purification costs and minimizing the likelihood of facility shutdowns, decontamination issues, and supply limitations that lead to unmet patient/customer demands. Although the costs of downstream processing and purification are comparable in microbial, mammalian, and plantbased platforms, the lower up-front investment required for commercial production in plants and the potential economy of scale provided by cultivation over large areas are key advantages. \n\nThis combination of low capital investment, low-cost of goods, and highly scalable manufacturing means that many proteins that are unsuitable for production in fermenters can be produced commercially using plants.",

The advantages of E. coli as an organism for recombinant protein expression and purification are well known and rely on simplicity, fast growth, and cost-effective procedures of cell cultivation and protein extraction. Despite the availability of diverse E. coli strains, a variety of expression plasmids, and the number of approaches developed to produce different recombinant peptides and proteins [1,2], the application of such a heterologous host is still limited or not even possible for a broad range of peptides and proteins. The examples of difficult-to-obtain proteins include eukaryotic ones, whose synthesis requires codon optimization or post-translational modification, disulfide-bonded, toxic and integral membrane peptides and proteins. Moreover, screening for optimal strategy for the desired protein synthesis can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. \n\nSince it has been identified that protein synthesis is a ribosome-mediated process [3] that does not require the integrity of the cell [4], cell-free (CF) or in vitro protein synthesis is considered a good alternative for recombinant protein production. The productivity of cell-free expression systems has been greatly improved and in vitro methodology has been used for a variety of applications. The CF protein synthesis systems are generally constructed with cell extract prepared from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, or rabbit reticulocytes. The E. coli extract-based CF expression system is the most popular, and broad varieties of in vitro protein synthesis systems are commercialized by various companies (e.g., Biotechrabbit, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Promega), and have been used for a range of applications. \n\nThe CF protein synthesis system has several advantages over current in vivo processes. Firstly, since there is no need to support cellular metabolism; all of the cellular resources can be efficiently directed toward the production of a single protein [5].",

            "text": "There is only a limited number of examples of E. coli strains with improved protein production characteristics isolated by evolutionary approaches. Interestingly, using evolutionary approaches to modulate metabolic pathways in E. coli for metabolite production has been very successful [110,111]. This appears to be due to the relative ease to monitor most metabolites. Therefore, it is not surprising that the major bottleneck hampering the use of evolutionary approaches to isolate E. coli protein production strains seems to be the ability to rapidly and accurately monitor not only the amount, but also the quality of a produced protein. The importance of being able to monitor Isolating Escherichia coli strains for recombinant protein production 903 both protein quantity and quality is nicely illustrated by the isolation of strains with improved IgG and mtVKORc1 production characteristics [116,120]. We reckon that the development of, in many instances target-specific, assays to rapidly monitor protein production will be key for extending the use of evolutionary approaches to isolate E. coli protein production strains. In all the reported examples of the isolation of E. coli protein production strains, different strain backgrounds, promoter systems, induction regimes, culturing conditions and, sometimes, also ways to facilitate mutagenesis were used. This makes that it is currently impossible to formulate general rules for how to design an experiment to isolate an E. coli protein production strain. So far, it appears that the effects that most of the aforementioned factors can have on the isolation of protein production strains may have been underestimated. One obvious example is the isolation of C41(DE3) from BL21(DE3), which depended on the presence of the native lac wild-type promoter and RecA in the ancestor strain BL21(DE3). However, also more subtle factors like the induction kinetics of a chosen promoter system or varying levels of global regulators in different strain backgrounds may influence the evolutionary trajectories of protein production strains. Also, stress caused by e.g., starvation, temperature fluctuations, and exposure to antibiotics during the strain isolation procedure may affect evolutionary trajectories [37]. Therefore, accumulated mutations in an isolated protein production strain may not only reflect adaptations improving protein production. The presence of the same or similar mutations in multiple, parallel isolated strains may help to identify the",

The drawbacks of these systems are due to the absence of post-translational modifications and a poor excretion system, as the stability of the proteins depends on the oxidative environment where it is secreted. In addition, inclusion bodies can be formed, hindering antibody purification [229][230][231] . Strategies to optimize antibody production in E. coli are listed in Table 3. \n\nThe most commonly used yeasts for these purposes are Pichia pastoris [240][241][242] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 243,244 . Both are easy to grow, perform post-translational modifications such us disulfide-bonded and protein glycosylation, have a high growth rate and protein secretion levels are very high. Contrary to bacterial expression systems, protein secretion in yeasts constitutes a great productive advantage since the secreted proteins are harvested relatively quickly from the culture medium, so downstream processes are cheaper 242,245 . Pichia pastoris is also the most widely used yeast strain due to its ease of industrial scaling. It reduces costs and minimizes equipment used for implementing pilot or industrial bioreactors 246 . Yeast expression systems are used to produce recombinant antibodies and proteins with inhibitory action against venom toxins (Figure 2). The antimyotoxic protein DM64, which acts against phospholipases A2 of Bothrops asper venom 247 , was successfully produced by a recombinant Pichia pastoris. \n\nMammalian cells are commonly used to produce biopharmaceuticals, antibodies and active protein 248 . Antibody production in mammalian cell systems is mainly selected by its ability to carry out post-translational modifications that maintain antibody stability so a correct protein function. However, expensive culture media due to nutrient requirements and high contamination rates limit this technology. In addition, yields are low and the slow production time increases costs 236,249 . \n\nLaustsen et al. 251 and Jenkins and Laustsen 250 estimated the cost of large-scale production of antibodies in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell expression systems using a fed-batch fermentation strategy.",

Furthermore, the authenticity of glycosylation performed by mammalian host cells is an important advantage over all other expression hosts. However, progress in the technologies that enable reproducible gene delivery and selection of stable clones continues to be slow (Bandaranayake and Almo, 2013). Moreover, specific yields from mammalian cell-lines are often low (Zhu, 2012) and Table 1 shows a declining trend in their use. \n\nEukaryotic microbes offer substantial advantages as host cells, despite their propensity to hyperglycosylate recombinant proteins. For example, an annotated genome sequence has been available for S. cerevisiae for almost two decades (Goffeau et al., 1996), an impressive range of deletion and over-expression strains are readily available for S. cerevisiae and the P. pastoris genome has been available since 2009 (De Schutter et al., 2009). Combining this wealth of molecular and genetic resources, with the fact that yeasts grow an order of magnitude more rapidly than mammalian cell-lines means that protein production and optimization can be done quickly and efficiently in yeast (Porro et al., 2011). Table 1 shows that for P. pastoris, at least, there is an increasing trend in its usage suggesting that these advantages have become more widely known. This is especially notable because P. pastoris is a relative new-comer, only having been first developed as a host system in 1985 (Cregg et al., 1985).",

            "text": "Batch fermentations in baffled flasks (Nalgene) were performed to examine the effects of medium composition on cell growth and biomass production in recombinant E. coli:pAV01. Initially, high density biomass and protein level expression was compared in five different 1 L shaken culture media to help determine the most favorable media and optimal growth conditions for higher quantity protein and biomass production. During shaking cultivation, increase in cell density was observed in complex media type TB (Table 1), when using the baffled Erlenmeyer flask type. The total protein concentration from the collected 1 mL cell pellets obtained from the overall cultures was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay from Pierce (Rockford, USA) and protein expression was further analyzed using 15 % SDS-PAGE. From Table 1, the results show high total protein and biomass production in LB and TB, with TB producing even higher, while less biomass production was observed in mineral salt media MMM, M9 and RMM. Higher protein content (per gram of cell mass) was observed in complex media containing rich nutrients like yeast extracts than in synthetic media. However, the total protein/biomass ratio for all the media was nearly the same. \n\nBased on the shaking culture results, TB, a complex medium and MMM, a synthetic medium (Table 1) were used in mini-pilot scale fermentation. During fermentation, batch culture, then followed by fed batch techniques were used to obtain high cell densities. Biomass production was monitored during cultivation at OD 600 , and from Fig. 1 it can be observed that the feed rate increased exponentially to maintain a specific growth rate at 37 \u00b0C. Feed media (glucose) was added to introduce a carbon source and for the purpose of achieving higher cell density. The feed rate adjustments were done according to observations in the previous shake flask studies. After 22 h of cultivation, feed was reduced and culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG final concentration for the induction of the T7 promoter-mediated gene expression and for the production of AviPure. From Fig. 1, the relationship between growth rates in time and change in biomass can easily be noticed as the exponential growth phase between 12 and 22 h is the most remarkable.",

            "text": "The field of proteomics involves investigating any aspect of a protein, such as its structure, modification, localization, and interactions with proteins or other molecules. \n\nTo study the biological function of a specific protein, researchers select a certain method to produce the functional protein of interest. A variety of protein expression systems, including cell-based and cell-free ones, have been developed for this purpose. \n\nEscherichia coli is one of the most convenient organisms for producing recombinant proteins [1]. E. coli protein expression systems do not usually enable post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and lipidation, so they are mainly suitable for preparing prokaryotic proteins or eukaryotic proteins that do not require posttranslational modifications. Eukaryotic protein expression systems, such as baculovirusinsect cells, yeast, and mammalian cells, have the capacity to carry out post-translational modifications to express functional eukaryotic proteins, such as active kinases [2][3][4]. These cell-based systems have the advantage of a high yield, and the prepared proteins are also applicable for structural analysis, functional assays, the study of protein-protein interactions, and antibody production, among others. In addition to these research objectives, these cell-based expression systems are frequently employed for the production of recombinant proteins as therapeutics [4]. \n\nCell-free expression systems, also known as in vitro transcription/translation systems, have become a popular and useful approach in basic and applied sciences [5][6][7][8][9]. Because cell-free systems have the ability to produce proteins in a rapid and high-throughput manner, they are increasingly being used in high-throughput functional genomics and proteomics. In recent years, propelled by the increasing production capacity, cell-free systems have attracted interest not only for research purposes but also in the pharmaceutical industry [5,10]. Using cell-free systems, protein synthesis can be performed in coupled transcription and translation systems using a DNA template within a few hours. The systems contain macromolecular components required for transcription and translation.",

            "text": "Batch fermentations in baffled flasks (Nalgene) were performed to examine the effects of medium composition on cell growth and biomass production in recombinant E. coli:pAV01. Initially, high density biomass and protein level expression was compared in five different 1 L shaken culture media to help determine the most favorable media and optimal growth conditions for higher quantity protein and biomass production. During shaking cultivation, increase in cell density was observed in complex media type TB (Table 1), when using the baffled Erlenmeyer flask type. The total protein concentration from the collected 1 mL cell pellets obtained from the overall cultures was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay from Pierce (Rockford, USA) and protein expression was further analyzed using 15 % SDS-PAGE. From Table 1, the results show high total protein and biomass production in LB and TB, with TB producing even higher, while less biomass production was observed in mineral salt media MMM, M9 and RMM. Higher protein content (per gram of cell mass) was observed in complex media containing rich nutrients like yeast extracts than in synthetic media. However, the total protein/biomass ratio for all the media was nearly the same. \n\nBased on the shaking culture results, TB, a complex medium and MMM, a synthetic medium (Table 1) were used in mini-pilot scale fermentation. During fermentation, batch culture, then followed by fed batch techniques were used to obtain high cell densities. Biomass production was monitored during cultivation at OD 600 , and from Fig. 1 it can be observed that the feed rate increased exponentially to maintain a specific growth rate at 37 \u00b0C. Feed media (glucose) was added to introduce a carbon source and for the purpose of achieving higher cell density. The feed rate adjustments were done according to observations in the previous shake flask studies. After 22 h of cultivation, feed was reduced and culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG final concentration for the induction of the T7 promoter-mediated gene expression and for the production of AviPure. From Fig. 1, the relationship between growth rates in time and change in biomass can easily be noticed as the exponential growth phase between 12 and 22 h is the most remarkable.",

            "text": "Multiple protein expression systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. However, Escherichia coli is the host system widely used in the production of the rec PrP due to multiple significant benefits over other expression systems including a well-established protein overexpression protocol, low costs, ease of use, and scale (Terpe 2006). A vast number of Escherichia coli strains as well as plasmid vectors with a variety of choices of promoters, affinity tags, and antibiotic resistance are commercially available with the purpose to confer the best results of transformation in the Escherichia coli and an ultimate yield in protein expression. Due to the intrinsic affinity of the PrP C for metals, the additional His-tag sequence is not needed as fusion to PrP to obtain a simple and faster protein purification (Csire et al. 2020;Jackson et al. 2001;Schmitz et al. 2016a). PrP expression in Escherichia coli can be achieved overnight by using autoinduction media or by IPTG protocols (Fig. 1). Commercial or homemade auto-induction media have preferentially been used for the expression of recombinant proteins due to being convenient since the bacterial growth does not need to be measured and due to a higher yield of protein (several-fold higher than conventional IPTG induction systems) (Grabski et al. 2005;Studier 2005). The majority of rec PrP is localized in the inclusion bodies. The isolation of these inclusion bodies can be achieved by a purification protocol for inclusion bodies (Palmer and Wingfield 2004) or with the use of BugBuster Master Mix buffer, which so far is the most effective and fastest method (Fig. 1) (Bourkas et al. 2019). It allows a maximal recovery of functional proteins from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After purification, inclusion bodies are denatured (by guanidine or urea buffer) with the purpose to release the overexpressed proteins in the supernatant.",

            "text": "profiles could control acetate formation but also reduce the bacterial cell growth rate. Dialysis and macro porous ion-exchange resin based fermentors have been widely employed in order to obtain high cell density cultivations of E. coli, limiting acetate inhibition and, at the same time, avoiding the drawbacks of low growth rate feeding methods [11][12][13]. Recently high cell density cultivations of E. coli for the production of recombinant proteins were performed in rocking-motion-type bioreactor [16]. A dialysis bioreactor has been used also for the growth of the capsulated strain E. coli K12 but the study focused on the biomass formation and not on the polysaccharide production [17]. The inhibiting effect of acetate on E. coli K4 growth rate could be a problem in the designing of a high cell density cultivation process for the production of the chondroitin-like capsular polysaccharide. Although the capsular polysaccharide constitutes part of the cell wall and could be considered a biomass related product, its biosynthesis is influenced by nutritional, environmental and cultivation conditions [7,8]. For these reasons we first investigated, in shake flask experiments, the effect of acetate, added to the conventional medium, and its influence on both bacterial cell growth and K4 CPS production. Our data showed that acetate concentrations higher than 5 g\u00b7L -1 negatively influenced E. coli K4 growth rates, while K4 CPS production is positively affected up to 10 g\u00b7L -1 acetate supplementation and progressively reduced by higher concentration addition (Figure 2). An acetate concentration higher than 5 g\u00b7L -1 is commonly considered an inhibiting threshold for E. coli genus, because it reduces growth rates and biomass yield [18]; De May and co-worker even reported a decrease of growth and of recombinant protein production above 1 g\u00b7L -1 [10]. E. coli K4 showed the same behaviour, although a higher tolerance for the acetate presence in the medium, up to 10 g\u00b7L -1 , was observed. This higher adaptability could probably be related to the presence of the capsular polysaccharide that has a role of cell protective",

            "text": "The Escherichia coli pET expression system remains one of the most popular systems for recombinant protein production (Shilling et al., 2020). Numerous strategies have been proposed to improve recombinant protein production, including codon optimization of target proteins (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008;Menzella, 2011;Chung and Lee, 2012), screening and construction of a superior host cell (Choi et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2015;Hayat et al., 2018), addition of fusion tags (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006;Young et al., 2012;Hayat et al., 2018), optimization of expression elements (Gustafsson et al., 2012;Eichmann et al., 2019), or the development of high-density fermentation processes (Yee and Blanch, 1992;Zhang et al., 2000;Thongekkaew et al., 2008). Although E. coli is highly amenable to genetic modification and has a clear genetic background, quite many genes of interest (GOIs) were not well-expressed in E. coli. Furthermore, contamination of fermentation processes with other microorganisms or phages is a common problem that requires an urgent solution (Samson et al., 2013;Ou et al., 2020). Developing alternative hosts that possess a distinct spectrum of highly expressed GOIs complementary to E. coli and compatible with the pET expression system is an attractive way to solve this problem (Calero and Nikel, 2019). \n\nVibrio natriegens, a Gram-negative, non-pathogenic marine bacterium (Payne, 1958), is considered the fastest growing freeliving bacterium, with a doubling time between 7 and 10 min under optimal conditions (Eagon, 1962;Weinstock et al., 2016;Lee et al., 2019). Estimates for the number of ribosomes in V. natriegens in the exponential phase suggest around 115,000 per cell, while E. coli is estimated to have only 70,000-90,000 (Des Soye et al., 2018), which partly explains its greater biomass synthesis rate and stronger protein expression ability (Zhu et al., 2020).",

Several hormones, antibody subunits, vaccines, enzymes, and interferons are being produced at the industrial level, in suitable expression systems, under optimized conditions. For recombinant protein production, a range of expression systems are available such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, plant cells, insects and animal cells, etc. Each recombinant protein has different nature due to which it requires different challenges regarding the expression system and production conditions. Every expression system has its advantages and limitations on the basis of which it can be considered or rejected for a particular protein production. Therefore, it is very significant to investigate the potential and limitations of several expression systems to choose the suitable one for particular protein production at an industrial scale. The optimization criteria of an expression system is evaluated on several factors such as productivity, efficiency, physiological characteristics, total cost, safety, convenience, and down-streaming conditions. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae remained the organisms of choice to produce recombinant proteins for a long time, but now several other microorganisms are also being targeted to evaluate their efficiency toward recombinant protein production. Prokaryotic expression systems can be used to produce eukaryotic proteins as well however, the use of a eukaryotic expression system is preferable because it retains the structural, functional, and regulatory properties of therapeutic proteins. This review illustrates a brief view of a variety of expression systems, their efficiency, and limitations in recombinant protein production.",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins are used for both the treatment and prevention of diseases in humans and animals. The production of recombinant proteins in academic research is also important to identify protein functions and elucidate protein structure. Human insulin was the first therapeutic recombinant protein; it was produced in Escherichia coli in 1978 by Dr. David Goeddel and his colleagues (Goeddel et al. 1979) and was approved by FDA in 1982, then sold as 'Humulin' (Quianzon and Cheikh 2012). Since then, more than 170 recombinant protein drugs have come to the market and hundreds are currently being developed for the treatment of diseases, such as arthritis and cancer (Batta et al. 2020;Margolin et al. 2018;Marsian and Lomonossoff 2016;Pham 2018;Torre and Albericio 2021). Most of the approved recombinant biopharmaceuticals are generated in mammalian cell lines (Lalonde and Durocher 2017). Currently, biologics are produced in bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, insects, and plant systems. \n\nIn contrast to chemical compounds, recombinant proteins are very large and complex molecules with sophisticated and specific mechanisms. Because of their size and complexity, the chemical synthesis of proteins is incredibly difficult; thus, recombinant proteins are biologically produced using the protein synthesis machinery (Puetz and Wurm 2019). All production systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, such as production time, operating costs, protein yield, potential contamination from pathogenic microorganisms, posttranslational modifications, and regulatory approval. \n\nPlant expression systems have several potential advantages over conventional expression systems. Besides, the reliability of such systems for the production of highly valuable proteins has been demonstrated (Lindsay et al. 2018;Malm et al. 2019;Ward et al. 2021). The first recorded example of biopharming in plants was the production of a chimeric human growth hormone via transgenic tobacco and sunflower callus tissue in 1986 (Barta et al. 1986).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most widely used protein production host in academia and a major host for industrial protein production. However, recombinant production of eukaryotic proteins in prokaryotes has challenges. One of these is post-translational modifications, including native disulfide bond formation. Proteins containing disulfide bonds have traditionally been made by targeting to the periplasm or by in vitro refolding of proteins made as inclusion bodies. More recently, systems for the production of disulfide-containing proteins in the cytoplasm have been introduced. However, it is unclear if these systems have the capacity for the production of disulfide-rich eukaryotic proteins. To address this question, we tested the capacity of one such system to produce domain constructs, containing up to 44 disulfide bonds, of the mammalian extracellular matrix proteins mucin 2, alpha tectorin, and perlecan. All were successfully produced with purified yields up to 6.5 mg/L. The proteins were further analyzed using a variety of biophysical techniques including circular dichroism spectrometry, thermal stability assay, and mass spectrometry. These analyses indicated that the purified proteins are most likely correctly folded to their native state. This greatly extends the use of E. coli for the production of eukaryotic proteins for structural and functional studies.",

            "title": "Recent developments in therapeutic protein expression technologies in plants",
            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technology has widened the research arena for biologists. The manipulation of Escherichia coli provided the first expression system (Itakura et al. 1977) for therapeutic proteins, pioneering the production of recombinant proteins. The subsequent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Human insulin receives FDA approval 1982), of an E. coli-based insulin (Goeddel et al. 1979) confirmed the utility of recombinant therapeutic protein production. As a prokaryote, E. coli cannot accurately express complex eukaryotic protein because almost all eukaryotic proteins are modified post-translationally and require the appropriate machinery to impart the characteristic structural features that are essential for their functional integrity. Resolution of this problem has led to the development of other expression systems, including the yeast system, the Baculovirus system, the mammalian cell system, and the plant expression system. Each type of expression system has been used extensively for the production of recombinant therapeutic compounds, with varying success, because no single system is universally appropriate for all tasks. However, plant expression systems excel in the production of plant-derived edible vaccines (Goeddel et al. 1979;Mishra et al. 2008;Yang and Yang 2010) and have tremendous growth potential as the basis of the modern discipline, providing immediate cures for infectious diseases. Simultaneous expression of multigenes reviewed by (Zorrilla-Lopez et al. 2013) into plants can alter complex metabolic pathways that can be used to produce compounds of pharmaceutics. \n\nThe transfer of foreign DNA from diverse organisms and its integration into a host genome form the backbone of recombinant DNA technology. However, the expression of a foreign gene in a host plant cell is dependent on the cumulative effects of several elements essential for cell transformation (coding sequence, promoter region, transcript termination, etc.), the plant cell pH, the efficiency and accuracy of the transcriptional and translational machinery, plant cell biochemistry, the availability of the amino acids required for the recombinant protein, the interaction between and storage of the expressed proteins in the plant cellular environment, and many other predictable and unknown factors.",

Therefore it is necessary to develop reproducible bioprocesses to rapidly produce proteins of adequate quality and quantity. Expression in mammalian cells is preferred if the proteins are to be properly folded and post-translationally modified. For the rapid production of milligram to gram quantities of a protein in mammalian cells, large-scale transient gene expression is an attractive option. The two most important components of this technology are the cell cultivation system and the gene delivery method. For this reason the goal of this thesis was to develop novel cost-efficient cell cultivation systems and gene delivery methods for the large-scale transfection of mammalian cells in chemically defined media free of any animal-derived components including serum. Cultivation of mammalian cells in suspension is essential for large-scale transient gene expression. A superior system for the cultivation of mammalian cells based on the agitation of cells in \"square-shaped\" glass bottles (square bottles) was developed. It is an inexpensive but efficient means to grow cells to a high density without instrumentation. The growth and viability of cultures of both human embryo kidney (HEK) 293E and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cells in agitated one-liter square bottles exceeded that in spinner flasks, reaching cell densities 1.5 times higher on average. Furthermore, an efficient and reproducible method to transfect cells in agitated square bottles was developed for both HEK 293E and CHO DG44 cells. A novel gene delivery method termed calfection that relies on the addition of DNA and CaCl2 directly to a suspension culture was developed. Calfection has a number of advantages over existing gene delivery methods such as calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation in that there are no time-dependent steps. The DNA/CaCl2 solution can be stored for long periods and is filterable. It is suitable for both large-scale transfections in bioreactors and for high-throughput transfections in microtiter plates. One drawback, however, is its dependence on the presence of serum in the culture medium. A second gene delivery method, serum-free transfection with polyethylenimine (polyfection), proved to be highly efficient for the transfection of both HEK 293E and CHO DG44 cells. A reproducible method for polyfection in microtiter plates, 50 ml centrifuge tubes, agitated square and round bottles, spinner flasks, and bioreactors was optimized for these two cell lines. Polyfection proved to be a simple and successful gene transfer method in both instrumented and non-instrumented cultivation systems. Importantly, it could be performed in serum-free chemically defined media. With HEK 293E cells, 80 mg/l of antibody was produced in agitated square bottles and with CHO DG44 cells, more than 2 g of antibody were produced in one week in a 150-liter bioreactor.",

            "abstract": "In the biopharmaceutical industry mammalian cells are cultivated for the production of recombinant glycoproteins, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies. In contrast to other expression systems, such as prokaryotes or yeasts, mammalian cells are able to glycosylate and fold therapeutic proteins correctly, and therefore the only possible production system for many (recombinant) therapeutics.Cultivated mammalian cells are similar to tumor cells: in contrast to normal cells in mammalian tissue they can proliferate continuously and are not differentiated to fulfill tissue-specific tasks. Cultivated cells and tumor cells also share other characteristics, for example in their metabolism. In general the metabolism of continuously proliferating cells is not or only poorly regulated and controlled, and therefore inefficient. Cultivated mammalian cells show a high metabolic activity, and waste large amounts of nutrients and energy. Instead of tuning the consumption of glucose and certain amino acids to the requirements for growth, these nutrients are taken up whenever they are available. As a result waste products such as lactic acid, carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate accumulate, acidify the culture medium, and inhibit cell growth and protein production.Another shared characteristic of tumor cells and cultured mammalian cells is the production of ammonia. Mammals normally produce urea, a waste product of the endogenuous metabolism, in the liver. Mammalian cells that are cultivated for glycoprotein production do not possess the machinery for the production of urea. Instead they secrete ammonia into the culture medium, which accumulates at toxic levels.It is thus apparent that the metabolism of mammalian cells is suboptimal for an efficient energy- and nutrient supply. To quantify the exact nutrient requirements for growth and energy, and to investigate which metabolic pathways should be optimized to reduce waste-product synthesis to increase production yields, the intracellular reaction rates, i.e. \"the metabolic fluxes\", have to be determined. Intracellular fluxes can be quantitated by incubating cells with isotope-labeled nutrients and measurement of the isotope distributions of end-products. This method (i) has practical limitations as it is limited to the analysis of single metabolic pathways per tracer experiment, (ii) is expensive, and (iii) is not feasible at industrial scale. An alternative method is based on solving the linear set of equations that is determined by the mass balances of the relevant metabolites. In this dissertation this new method which is referred to as \"metabolic-flux balancing\" is applied to mammalian-cell culture. Metabolic-flux balancing techniques are based on relatively simple linear algebra. If the stoichiometry of the relevant intracellular reactions and the cellular composition are known and the uptake- and secretion rates of the relevant metabolites have been measured, the reaction rates can be determined using the appropriate mass-balance equations. Taken together, the mass-balance equations form a set of linear equations that can be solved by linear regression. However in the metabolism of the cell there are a number of cyclic pathways which are linearly dependent within the set of mass-balance equations, which causes the metabolic network to be underdetermined. This is the central problem in this dissertation and is explained in detail in Chapter 1. In most cyclic metabolic pathways certain co-metabolites are consumed or produced. Carbon dioxide for example, is a waste product of the TCA cycle. By measuring the carbon-dioxide production rate it should therefore be possible to estimate the flux through this essential metabolic cycle. However, in mammalian-cell culture the measurement of the carbon-dioxide production rate is troubled by the use of bicarbonate as a buffer system and the accumulation carbon dioxide in the culture medium. In Chapter 2 a method is developed for the determination of the carbon-dioxide production rate in bicarbonate-buffered bioreactor systems. In Chapter 3 it is shown that, if this method is used, it is possible to close the mass balance for total carbon in mammalian-cell culture. Together with the balance for nitrogen it is now possible to demonstrate statistically that there are no gross errors in the measurement data and there are not missing any relevant metabolites. Now, the metabolic-flux analysis can start..... Unfortunately, the intracellular fluxes cannot be determined solely by flux-balancing techniques even when the mass balances of co-metabolites such as carbon dioxide are included in the metabolic network. This is both a result of the fact that mass balances of particular co-metabolites cannot be closed ( e.g. the mass balance of ATP), and of the fact that co-metabolites are produced or consumed in more than one cyclic pathway. Such cyclic pathways remain therefore linearly dependent, and additional information is required to quantify the flows through these cycles. A solution is proposed in Chapter 4. It is assumed that hybridoma cells are efficient with respect to their metabolism (while taking into account the \"inefficient\" production and uptake rates mentioned above), and minimize the flow through the metabolic network. Within the set of all admissible solutions, the flux distribution with the minimum sum of squares is chosen. This assumption is referred to as the \"minimum-norm constraint\". The method is applied to hybridoma cells under both optimal and suboptimal conditions. In Chapter 5 experiments are described that are conducted to test the assumption mentioned above. The metabolic fluxes in the TCA cycle, the pentose-phosphate cycle, and the malate shunt are determined by 13 C-tracer experiments. Hybridoma cells are cultured on a small scale and 13 C-labeled glucose is added to the culture medium. Subsequently, the isotopic distribution of lactate is determined by NMR spectrometry and the fraction of 13 C in carbon dioxide is measured by mass spectrometry. It appears that the actual fluxes in the mentioned cycles are significantly different from the fluxes estimated using the minimum-norm constraint.In addition, it appears that rapidly proliferating hybridoma cells have a higher pentose-shunt activity than previously assumed. The reason for this high activity is probably the high need for NADPH (which is required for biomass synthesis). This also means that a larger part of glucose is consumed more efficiently than previously assumed on the basis of the amount of produced lactate alone. This allows to estimate the optimal amount of glucose that cells should consume per gram produced biomass. In Chapter 6 other theoretical methods to estimate metabolic fluxes in underdetermined networks are used to estimate fluxes in cyclic pathways. Linear optimization techniques are applied to determine solutions that are optimal with respect to particular \"metabolic objectives\". Various metabolic strategies that may be relevant for hybridoma cells are translated into so-called \"linear objective functions\" and used to estimate the metabolic flux distribution. It appears that the biochemical objective \"maximize NADH-producing fluxes\" gives flux values that approximate the values determined experimentally by isotopic-tracer studies (Chapter 5). It is speculated that this objective is in agreement with the uncontrolled oxidation of any available nutrients by continuously-growing mammalian cells, regardless of the need for ATP or NADH. Under certain (extreme) culture conditions cells have to adapt their metabolism to the stress to which they are exposed. For example, cells in a bioreactor can be limited in oxygen supply, or certain toxic components can force the cell to redirect the fluxes into a particular direction. In Chapter 7 several experiments are described in which hybridoma cells are artificially stressed. It is shown that at oxygen limitation certain NAD(P)H-producing fluxes decrease , most likely to restore the disturbed NAD(P) + /NADPH balance. Under oxidative stress the opposite occurs: NAD(P)H-producing fluxes increase. Other fluxes which -strictly speaken- cannot be determined by balancing techniques alone are subsequently estimated with \"physiologically meaningful\" objective functions. These objectives are associated with the metabolic strategy to adapt to the relevant stress. For example, at oxygen limitation the objective function \"minimize NADH-producing fluxes\" applies. Ammonia is a waste product that is toxic for mammalian cells at relatively low concentrations and it limits the cell density in bioreactors. In Chapter 8 it is shown by flux-balancing techniques that hybridoma cells can reduce ammonia levels by converting ammonia and\u03b1-ketoglutarate into glutamate (a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase). This suggests that overexpression of this enzyme may allow mammalian cells to survive higher concentrations of ammonia, which potentially enables high-cell density cultures. It has been demonstrated that an important fraction of fluxes of large metabolic networks such as mammalian-cell metabolism can be estimated with only mass-balancing techniques. For the determination of fluxes in cyclic pathways isotopic-tracer experiments remain indispensable. However, relative trends in intracellular metabolic fluxes upon changes in extracellular conditions can be determined solely by mass-balancing techniques even if the metabolic network is principally underdetermined. The combination of flux-balance models and isotopic-tracer studies, of which an example is given in Chapter 5, will be the future tool of quantitative flux analysis of complex metabolic networks.",

In the present study, P. pastoris and insect cell expression systems for the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 subtype (CHRM2) were developed and the quantity and quality of CHRM2 synthesized by both expression systems were compared for the application in structural studies.ResultsThe ideal conditions for the expression of CHRM2 in P. pastoris were 60 hr at 20\u00b0C in a buffer of pH 7.0. The specific activity of the expressed CHRM2 was 28.9 pmol/mg of membrane protein as determined by binding assays using [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). Although the specific activity of the protein produced by P. pastoris was lower than that of Sf9 insect cells, CHRM2 yield in P. pastoris was 2-fold higher than in Sf9 insect cells because P. pastoris was cultured at high cell density. The dissociation constant (Kd) for QNB in P. pastoris was 101.14 \u00b1 15.07 pM, which was similar to that in Sf9 insect cells (86.23 \u00b1 8.57 pM).

A non common but interesting research area is related to peptides with intracellular targets, which opens up new possibilities, allowing the modulation of processes occurring within the cell or interference with signaling pathways. However, if the bioactive sequence requires fusion to a carrier peptide to allow access into the cell, the resulting peptide could be such a length that traditional production could be difficult. The goal of the present study was the development of a flexible recombinant expression and purification system for peptides, as a contribution to the discovery and development of these potentially new drugs.ResultsIn this work, a high throughput recombinant expression and purification system for production of cell penetrating peptides in Escherichia coli has been designed and implemented. The system designed produces target peptides in an insoluble form by fusion to a hexahistidine tagged ketosteroid isomerase which is then separated by a highly efficient thrombin cleavage reaction procedure. The expression system was tested on the anticancer peptides p53pAnt and PNC27. These peptides comprise the C-terminal region and the N-terminal region of the protein p53, respectively, fused by its carboxyl terminal extreme to the cell penetrating peptide Penetratin. High yields of purified recombinant fused peptides were obtained in both cases; nevertheless, thrombin cleavage reaction was successful only for p53pAnt peptide release. The features of the system, together with the procedure developed, allow achievement of high production yields of over 30\u00a0mg of highly pure p53pAnt peptide per g of dry cell mass. It is proposed that the system could be used for production of other peptides at a similar yield.ConclusionsThis study provides a system suitable for recombinant production of peptides for scientific research, including biological assays."

Widespread use of E. coli in biotechnology has led to the development of many different strains, and selecting an ideal host to produce a specific protein of interest is an important step in developing a production process. E. coli B and K\u201312 strains are frequently employed in large-scale production processes, and therefore are of particular interest. We previously evaluated the individual cultivation characteristics of E. coli BL21 and the K\u201312 hosts RV308 and HMS174. To our knowledge, there has not yet been a detailed comparison of the individual performances of these production strains in terms of recombinant protein production and system stability. The present study directly compared the T7-based expression hosts E. coli BL21(DE3), RV308(DE3), and HMS174(DE3), focusing on evaluating the specific attributes of these strains in relation to high-level protein production of the model protein recombinant human superoxide dismutase (SOD). The experimental setup was an exponential carbon-limited fed-batch cultivation with minimal media and single-pulse induction.ResultsThe host strain BL21(DE3) produced the highest amounts of specific protein, followed by HMS174(DE3) and RV308(DE3). The expression system HMS174(DE3) exhibited system stability by retaining the expression vector over the entire process time; however, it entirely stopped growing shortly after induction. In contrast, BL21(DE3) and RV308(DE3) encountered plasmid loss but maintained growth. RV308(DE3) exhibited the lowest ppGpp concentration, which is correlated with the metabolic stress level and lowest degradation of soluble protein fraction compared to both other strains.ConclusionsOverall, this study provides novel data regarding the individual strain properties and production capabilities, which will enable targeted strain selection for producing a specific protein of interest. This information can be used to accelerate future process design and implementation."

However, the cost and efficiency of the fungal enzyme cocktails that are normally employed in these processes remain a significant bottleneck. A potential route to increase hydrolysis yields and thereby reduce the hydrolysis costs would be to supplement the fungal enzymes with their lacking enzymatic activities, such as \u03b2-glucosidase. In this context, it is not clear from the literature whether recombinant E. coli could be a cost-effective platform for the production of some of these low-value enzymes, especially in the case of on-site production. Here, we present a conceptual design and techno-economic evaluation of the production of a low-cost industrial enzyme using recombinant E. coli.ResultsIn a simulated baseline scenario for \u03b2-glucosidase demand in a hypothetical second-generation ethanol (2G) plant in Brazil, we found that the production cost (316 US$/kg) was higher than what is commonly assumed in the literature for fungal enzymes, owing especially to the facility-dependent costs (45%) and to consumables (23%) and raw materials (25%). Sensitivity analyses of process scale, inoculation volume, and volumetric productivity indicated that optimized conditions may promote a dramatic reduction in enzyme cost and also revealed the most relevant factors affecting production costs.ConclusionsDespite the considerable technical and economic uncertainties that surround 2G ethanol and the large-scale production of low-cost recombinant enzymes, this work sheds light on some relevant questions and supports future studies in this field. In particular, we conclude that process optimization, on many fronts, may strongly reduce the costs of E. coli recombinant enzymes, in the context of tailor-made enzymatic cocktails for 2G ethanol production."

Even without optimization of cultivation conditions, an attractive productivity was obtained, indicating that biofilm cultures can be used as an alternative form of high cell density cultivation (HCDC). E. coli remains one of the favorite hosts for recombinant protein production and it has been successfully used in metabolic engineering for the synthesis of high value products. This review presents the advantages and concerns of using biofilms for the production of recombinant proteins and summarizes the different biofilm systems which have been described for this purpose. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the four microbial hosts tested for recombinant protein production in biofilms (two bacteria and two filamentous fungi) are also discussed."

There have been improvements on the transformation efficiency of 10 5\u2013 6 colonies/ \u03bcg plasmid DNA ( 2); the best probably that of Hanahan (3) yielding 107\u2013109. The highest rates are achieved using electroporation (10 9\u20131010). However, we experienced difficulties in electroporation of the repair deficient strain of Escherichia coli (BMH71-18 mut S) required in the Unique Site Mutagenesis (USE) technique ( 4) and examined factors effecting the efficiency of the calcium competent protocol. It is possible to transform cells in a fraction of the time recommended and vastly improve efficiency. Mutagenesis protocols generally rely on a high transformation efficiency, but this is not of prime concern for the majority of cloning techniques. Standard calcium chloride transformations are simple, cheap and the competent cells may be stored at 4 C or frozen at \u201370 C, whereas Hanahan cells must be used immediately and electroporating equipment is expensive. We have concentrated on three E.coli cell types, JM101 for general cloning steps, BL21(DE3) for subsequent protein expression and the repair deficient BMH71-18 mut S. Cells were grown at 37 C in 100 ml of 2xTY medium (16 g bacto tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/l pH 7.4) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline or ampicillin where appropriate. At an A600 \u223c0.7\u20130.8 they were chilled on ice, pelleted, resuspended in half volume of 0.1 M CaCl 2, cooled on ice for 30 min, repelleted and resuspended in 5 ml 0.1 M CaCl 2 (5). Competent cells were stored at 4 C or as 100 \u03bcl aliquots in 10% glycerol at \u201370 C. The plasmid used was a 4.8 kb construct of human gelsolin cDNA in pKN172 (a 2.6 kb ampicillin resistant pET based vector) ( 6) . In the \u2018standard protocol\u2019, \u223c1\u201310 ng of DNA was mixed with 100 \u03bcl of cells, left for 30 min on ice, heat shocked to 42 C for 2\u20133 min, cooled again on ice before 500 \u03bcl antibiotic free medium was added for a 30\u201360 min outgrowth at 37 C and final plating out on selective agar plates ( 5). Using these conditions we achieved \u223c5 \u00d7 106 colonies/ \u03bcg plasmid. The effect of salt concentration on electroporation has been well documented. Calcium competent E.coli were originally transformed using DNA solutions containing 20 mM NaCl ( 7), Figure 1 shows the effect NaCl has on these transformations. Optimum volumes for transformation were 8 \u00b1 4 \u03bcl DNA for 100 \u03bcl cells. Larger volumes reduced transformation efficiency: 30 \u03bcl gave 70% of the colonies obtained using 5 \u03bcl. The length of time that cells were pre-incubated on ice with DNA was not important. JM101 cells incubated with plasmid on ice for 1\u2013180 min before heat shock showed little variation in transformant numbers; at 180 min transformation was \u223c75% of that at 5 min. Transformations with BMH71-18mutS cells were variable and often as low as 20% of those obtained from the other cell lines. Incubation of cells with the plasmid on ice followed by directly spreading onto plates at room temperature (i.e. no 42 C heat hock) was sufficient to restore the higher transformation efficiency. When this was repeated on plates pre-incubated to 37 C the efficiency was even higher. Figure 2A shows results for JM101 cells incubated with the GS construct where the plasmid/cell mixtures have been plated directly from the incubation on ice onto agar plates pre-incubated to different temperatures. By spreading directly onto plates pre-incubated to 37 C we routinely achieve double the transformation efficiencies of the \u2018standard protocol\u2019. Once heat shocked to 42 C as in the standard transformation protocol, there is an indifference to the pre-incubation temperature of the plates (Fig. 2B). This figure also demonstrates that cells give higher transformation rates following 3\u20134 days storage at 4 C and can be used for periods of up to 2 weeks for simple transformation of plasmid, although in agreement with Dagert and Ehrlich\u2019s original observations they are best used after 24 h ( 8). Following 42 C heat shock, transformations were generally better with a 30\u201360 min 37 C non-selective medium recovery"

Recent developments in fermentation technology have provided a suitable platform to produce bioproducts for the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for bacterial, viral and other diseases. A bacterial system is the commonly used expression system for production of recombinant products such as proteins, enzymes, and antibodies. Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used bacterial hosts for the production of these products. A variety of recombinant proteins has been produced and cultivation studies have been carried out at small scale. However, the majority of the recombinant proteins are not amenable directly to large scale production processes due to various factors. To meet the growing demand of potential bioproducts, there is a need to produce these products in large quantity employing fermentation processes. Development of a suitable purification strategy is yet another important step to recover biologically active products. The present paper reviews the current developments in production and purification of recombinant products from E.\u00a0coli. The bioproducts obtained after fermentation and purification processes may fulfill the requirements for the development of various diagnostics, therapeutics, or prophylactic agents against different kinds of diseases."

But selection of the suitable expression system depends on productivity, bioactivity, purpose and physicochemical characteristics of the protein of interest. However, large scale production of recombinant proteins is still an art in spite of increased qualitative and quantitative demand for these proteins. Researchers are constantly challenged to improve and optimise the existing expression systems, and also to develop novel approaches to face the demands of producing the complex proteins. Here, we concisely review the most frequently used conventional and alternative host systems, with their unique features, along with advantages and disadvantages and their potential applications for the production of recombinant products.",

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

The typical low abundance of membrane proteins in their natural hosts makes it necessary to overexpress these proteins either in heterologous systems or through in vitro translation/cell-free expression. Heterologous expression of proteins, in turn, leads to multiple obstacles, owing to the unpredictability of compatibility of the target protein for expression in a given host. The highly hydrophobic and (or) amphipathic nature of membrane proteins also leads to challenges in producing a homogeneous, stable, and pure sample for structural studies. Circumventing these hurdles has become possible through the introduction of novel protein production protocols; efficient protein isolation and sample preparation methods; and, improvement in hardware and software for structural characterization. Combined, these advances have made the past 10-15 years very exciting and eventful for the field of membrane protein structural biology, with an exponential growth in the number of solved membrane protein structures. In this review, we focus on both the advances and diversity of protein production and purification methods that have allowed this growth in structural knowledge of membrane proteins through X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)."

This should be in synthesis format to provide context about what recombinant protein production is and why E. coli is widely used.\n\nThe main dimensions should focus on:\n\n1. \"Rapid Growth Rate Advantages\" - This should be in synthesis format because it needs to explain how E. coli's fast growth rate (doubling time of approximately 20 minutes) translates to benefits for production. Many quotes mention this characteristic.\n\n2. \"High Cell Density Cultivation Benefits\" - This should be in synthesis format as it requires explaining how high cell density cultivation (HCDC) techniques with E. coli contribute to increased productivity. This is central to the user's query.\n\n3. \"Economic Benefits Compared to Other Systems\" - This should be in synthesis format as it needs to compare the cost-effectiveness of E. coli to yeast and mammalian systems, showing why E. coli is often preferred.\n\n4. \"Production Advantages Over Yeast and Mammalian Systems\" - This should be in synthesis format as it directly addresses the comparative aspect of the user query, highlighting specific advantages E. coli has over these alternative systems.\n\n5. \"Limitations of E. coli Compared to Yeast and Mammalian Systems\" - This should be in synthesis format as it provides a balanced view by acknowledging where E. coli may fall short compared to the alternatives.\n\nThese dimensions will provide a comprehensive answer to the user's query, covering both the specific aspects they asked about (rapid growth rate and high cell density cultivation) while also placing these in the context of comparative advantages over yeast and mammalian systems.",

About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]."

This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved.

                            "Bacteria are the most frequently selected microorganisms, especially Escherichia coli. The use of bacteria is cost-effective due to low production costs, easy manipulation in the genome, fast growth rate and the possibility of using many molecular methods enabling to work with them at the cellular and molecular level.\n\nE. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways [23,36]. About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]."

Differently from other fermentation methods, high cell density fermentation is characterized by the highest operating costs (Ferreira et al., 2018). The advantage of using E. coli as bioreactor resides in five main factors: (i) rapid growth cycle, (ii) use of cheap growth media, (iii) capability of reaching high cell density through fermentation, (iv) possibility of using strains with low proteolytic activity, and (v) a thorough knowledge of its physiology and genetics. However, the translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce post-translational modifications such as the formation of cytoplasmic disulphide bridges or glycosylation. Moreover, the poor ability of Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins in the culture medium implies expensive and time-consuming purification procedures, thus representing additional costs for their large-scale production (Table 2). To overcome this drawback, different approaches to enhance the secretion efficiency of recombinant CWDEs in E. coli have been developed",
                            "Alternatively, expression hosts with higher secretion capabilities can be used such as the Grampositive bacteria B. subtilis (Morello et al., 2008) or Lactococcus lactis (Pohl and Harwood, 2010), and yeasts; the latter have higher secretion efficiency and can perform post-translational modifications."

By achieving higher cell concentrations, the process significantly reduces culture volume requirements, enhances biomass production, and improves product recovery, thereby reducing costs considerably <Paper corpusId=\"15597220\" paperTitle=\"(Kampf et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. These high cell concentrations, when combined with the higher production rates inherent to bacterial expression systems, result in superior volumetric productivities compared to alternative expression hosts <Paper corpusId=\"266127677\" paperTitle=\"(Bohm et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276466073\" paperTitle=\"(Vallejo et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of E. coli HCDC stems from multiple factors. E. coli requires relatively inexpensive substrates for growth, with the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors being well-studied and characterized <Paper corpusId=\"198595007\" paperTitle=\"(Sobolewska-Ruta et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This allows for the establishment of large-scale production systems due to the bacterium's ability to quickly reach high cell densities in inexpensive media <Paper corpusId=\"20985322\" paperTitle=\"(Santo et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Furthermore, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in amounts of up to 80% of its dry matter, which contributes to exceptional productivity per unit volume <Paper corpusId=\"198595007\" paperTitle=\"(Sobolewska-Ruta et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom an industrial perspective, E. coli HCDC offers significant advantages over alternative expression systems, particularly for non-glycosylated proteins. The minimal nutrient requirements, combined with the ability to achieve high cell densities, make E. coli particularly attractive for large-scale production <Paper corpusId=\"44129765\" paperTitle=\"(Soares et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the well-characterized genetics and large number of available cloning vectors facilitate optimization of expression conditions <Paper corpusId=\"240557350\" paperTitle=\"(Soares et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248088013\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor industrial applications, E. coli's HCDC capability has proven especially valuable when considering process economics. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10^13 cells can be obtained from just 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth medium <Paper corpusId=\"52017139\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. When scaled to industrial bioreactors and optimized fed-batch processes, these densities enable exceptionally high protein yields. This makes E. coli HCDC particularly well-suited for producing diagnostic and therapeutic proteins, where both quantity and cost-effectiveness are critical considerations <Paper corpusId=\"248736223\" paperTitle=\"(Sultan, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269931095\" paperTitle=\"(Goncalves et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile E. coli HCDC offers numerous advantages, it is important to acknowledge some limitations. The translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce certain post-translational modifications such as cytoplasmic disulfide bridges or glycosylation. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli have limited ability to secrete recombinant proteins into the culture medium, which can necessitate more complex purification procedures <Paper corpusId=\"216589014\" paperTitle=\"(Giovannoni et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4473355\" paperTitle=\"(Ferreira et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Nevertheless, for many applications, the economic benefits of high-density cultivation outweigh these limitations, particularly for non-glycosylated proteins that don't require extensive post-translational modifications.",

                            "Bacteria are the most frequently selected microorganisms, especially Escherichia coli. The use of bacteria is cost-effective due to low production costs, easy manipulation in the genome, fast growth rate and the possibility of using many molecular methods enabling to work with them at the cellular and molecular level.\n\nE. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways [23,36]. About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]."

Differently from other fermentation methods, high cell density fermentation is characterized by the highest operating costs (Ferreira et al., 2018). The advantage of using E. coli as bioreactor resides in five main factors: (i) rapid growth cycle, (ii) use of cheap growth media, (iii) capability of reaching high cell density through fermentation, (iv) possibility of using strains with low proteolytic activity, and (v) a thorough knowledge of its physiology and genetics. However, the translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce post-translational modifications such as the formation of cytoplasmic disulphide bridges or glycosylation. Moreover, the poor ability of Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins in the culture medium implies expensive and time-consuming purification procedures, thus representing additional costs for their large-scale production (Table 2). To overcome this drawback, different approaches to enhance the secretion efficiency of recombinant CWDEs in E. coli have been developed",
                            "Alternatively, expression hosts with higher secretion capabilities can be used such as the Grampositive bacteria B. subtilis (Morello et al., 2008) or Lactococcus lactis (Pohl and Harwood, 2010), and yeasts; the latter have higher secretion efficiency and can perform post-translational modifications."

                            "BackgroundThe enzymatic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars is a promising approach for producing renewable fuels and chemicals. However, the cost and efficiency of the fungal enzyme cocktails that are normally employed in these processes remain a significant bottleneck. A potential route to increase hydrolysis yields and thereby reduce the hydrolysis costs would be to supplement the fungal enzymes with their lacking enzymatic activities, such as \u03b2-glucosidase. In this context, it is not clear from the literature whether recombinant E. coli could be a cost-effective platform for the production of some of these low-value enzymes, especially in the case of on-site production. Here, we present a conceptual design and techno-economic evaluation of the production of a low-cost industrial enzyme using recombinant E. coli.ResultsIn a simulated baseline scenario for \u03b2-glucosidase demand in a hypothetical second-generation ethanol (2G) plant in Brazil, we found that the production cost (316 US$/kg) was higher than what is commonly assumed in the literature for fungal enzymes, owing especially to the facility-dependent costs (45%) and to consumables (23%) and raw materials (25%). Sensitivity analyses of process scale, inoculation volume, and volumetric productivity indicated that optimized conditions may promote a dramatic reduction in enzyme cost and also revealed the most relevant factors affecting production costs.ConclusionsDespite the considerable technical and economic uncertainties that surround 2G ethanol and the large-scale production of low-cost recombinant enzymes, this work sheds light on some relevant questions and supports future studies in this field. In particular, we conclude that process optimization, on many fronts, may strongly reduce the costs of E. coli recombinant enzymes, in the context of tailor-made enzymatic cocktails for 2G ethanol production."

The rapid growth rate of E. coli significantly reduces production timelines compared to slower-growing expression systems like yeast and mammalian cells <Paper corpusId=\"233674494\" paperTitle=\"(Iftikhar, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46973087\" paperTitle=\"(Paraskevopoulou et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The economic impact is particularly significant in large-scale industrial settings, where the cultivation time directly affects operational expenses.\n\nHigh cell density cultivation (HCDC) further enhances E. coli's economic advantages by maximizing volumetric productivity. By achieving higher cell concentrations, HCDC significantly reduces culture volume requirements, enhances biomass production, and improves product recovery, thereby substantially reducing production costs <Paper corpusId=\"15597220\" paperTitle=\"(Kampf et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248736223\" paperTitle=\"(Sultan, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

While mammalian cells excel at producing complex glycosylated proteins, they require expensive media, complex bioreactor setups, and longer cultivation times <Paper corpusId=\"237677625\" paperTitle=\"(Mitchell et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7945842\" paperTitle=\"(Baeshen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, yeast systems, while capable of some post-translational modifications, are still generally slower-growing and more expensive to cultivate than E. coli <Paper corpusId=\"276480527\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"90453662\" paperTitle=\"(Tripathi et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1585460\" paperTitle=\"(Rosano et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that E. coli does have economic limitations for certain applications. The translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce post-translational modifications such as cytoplasmic disulfide bridges or glycosylation. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli have limited ability to secrete recombinant proteins into the culture medium, which can necessitate more complex purification procedures <Paper corpusId=\"216589014\" paperTitle=\"(Giovannoni et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4473355\" paperTitle=\"(Ferreira et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. In these cases, expression hosts with higher secretion capabilities, such as yeasts, may offer economic advantages despite their slower growth rates.\n\nDespite these limitations, E. coli remains the most economically viable expression system for large-scale production of many therapeutic and industrial proteins. Approximately 30% of FDA-approved therapeutic proteins are produced using E. coli <Paper corpusId=\"198595007\" paperTitle=\"(Sobolewska-Ruta et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269931095\" paperTitle=\"(Goncalves et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1585460\" paperTitle=\"(Rosano et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This means that a culture inoculated with a 1/100 dilution of a saturated starter culture may reach stationary phase in a few hours. However, it should be noted that the expression of a recombinant protein may impart a metabolic burden on the microorganism, causing a considerable decrease in generation time (Bentley et al., 1990).\n\n(ii) High cell density cultures are easily achieved. The theoretical density limit of an E. coli liquid culture is estimated to be about 200 g dry cell weight/l or roughly 1 \u00d7 10 13 viable bacteria/ml (Lee, 1996)(Shiloach et al., 2005)."

                            "Biofilm research is usually focused on the prevention or control of biofilm formation. Recently, the significance of the biofilm mode of growth in biotechnological applications received increased attention. Since biofilm reactors show many advantages over suspended cell reactors, especially in their higher biomass density and operational stability, bacterial biofilms have emerged as an interesting approach for the expression of specific proteins. Despite the potential of biofilm systems, recombinant protein production using biofilms has been scarcely investigated for the past 25 years. Our group has demonstrated that E. coli biofilms were able to produce a model recombinant protein, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), at much higher levels than their planktonic counterparts. Even without optimization of cultivation conditions, an attractive productivity was obtained, indicating that biofilm cultures can be used as an alternative form of high cell density cultivation (HCDC). E. coli remains one of the favorite hosts for recombinant protein production and it has been successfully used in metabolic engineering for the synthesis of high value products. This review presents the advantages and concerns of using biofilms for the production of recombinant proteins and summarizes the different biofilm systems which have been described for this purpose. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the four microbial hosts tested for recombinant protein production in biofilms (two bacteria and two filamentous fungi) are also discussed."

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

Differently from other fermentation methods, high cell density fermentation is characterized by the highest operating costs (Ferreira et al., 2018). The advantage of using E. coli as bioreactor resides in five main factors: (i) rapid growth cycle, (ii) use of cheap growth media, (iii) capability of reaching high cell density through fermentation, (iv) possibility of using strains with low proteolytic activity, and (v) a thorough knowledge of its physiology and genetics. However, the translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce post-translational modifications such as the formation of cytoplasmic disulphide bridges or glycosylation. Moreover, the poor ability of Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins in the culture medium implies expensive and time-consuming purification procedures, thus representing additional costs for their large-scale production (Table 2). To overcome this drawback, different approaches to enhance the secretion efficiency of recombinant CWDEs in E. coli have been developed",

                            "BackgroundThe enzymatic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars is a promising approach for producing renewable fuels and chemicals. However, the cost and efficiency of the fungal enzyme cocktails that are normally employed in these processes remain a significant bottleneck. A potential route to increase hydrolysis yields and thereby reduce the hydrolysis costs would be to supplement the fungal enzymes with their lacking enzymatic activities, such as \u03b2-glucosidase. In this context, it is not clear from the literature whether recombinant E. coli could be a cost-effective platform for the production of some of these low-value enzymes, especially in the case of on-site production. Here, we present a conceptual design and techno-economic evaluation of the production of a low-cost industrial enzyme using recombinant E. coli.ResultsIn a simulated baseline scenario for \u03b2-glucosidase demand in a hypothetical second-generation ethanol (2G) plant in Brazil, we found that the production cost (316 US$/kg) was higher than what is commonly assumed in the literature for fungal enzymes, owing especially to the facility-dependent costs (45%) and to consumables (23%) and raw materials (25%). Sensitivity analyses of process scale, inoculation volume, and volumetric productivity indicated that optimized conditions may promote a dramatic reduction in enzyme cost and also revealed the most relevant factors affecting production costs.ConclusionsDespite the considerable technical and economic uncertainties that surround 2G ethanol and the large-scale production of low-cost recombinant enzymes, this work sheds light on some relevant questions and supports future studies in this field. In particular, we conclude that process optimization, on many fronts, may strongly reduce the costs of E. coli recombinant enzymes, in the context of tailor-made enzymatic cocktails for 2G ethanol production."

                            "Although various host cells described in the literature can serve as expression systems for recombinant protein production, almost all diagnostic RMP studies to date have used E. coli as the expression system of choice (Tables 1-5).What makes this host so well-suited for this purpose?This expression system boasts a long history and offers several well-established advantages, including ease of manipulation, low-cost culture, and rapid growth kinetics.The doubling time of 20 min facilitates the achievement of high cell density cultures, with a theoretical concentration limit of ~ 1 \u00d7 10^13 viable bacteria/mL [26,130].Furthermore, E. coli stands out as the most cost-effective host, allowing for the attainment of high cellular densities with inexpensive culture media.Additionally, well-developed tools for molecular manipulations, coupled with in-depth knowledge of its biology [131], contribute to the versatility of bacterium as a protein expression host."

These advantages make E. coli the dominant choice for industrial recombinant protein production, particularly for non-glycosylated proteins where its limitations are less relevant. (8 sources)",
                "text": "\nE. coli demonstrates significant production advantages over alternative expression systems, which explains why it accounts for 30-40% of proteins approved for therapeutic use <Paper corpusId=\"237677625\" paperTitle=\"(Mitchell et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7945842\" paperTitle=\"(Baeshen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The bacterial expression system offers dramatically higher volumetric productivity compared to yeast and mammalian systems, primarily due to the combination of high cell concentrations and inherently higher production rates <Paper corpusId=\"266127677\" paperTitle=\"(Bohm et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276466073\" paperTitle=\"(Vallejo et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced productivity directly translates into more efficient use of bioreactor capacity and reduced production timelines.\n\nGenetic simplicity and stability represent another significant advantage of E. coli over alternative expression systems. While yeast can suffer from genetic instability and clonal variation, E. coli provides a more consistent and predictable expression platform <Paper corpusId=\"57192905\" paperTitle=\"(Burdette et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This genetic stability is particularly valuable for industrial applications where batch-to-batch consistency is critical for regulatory compliance and product quality.\n\nThe well-characterized genome of E. coli and the extensive range of commercially available strains facilitate easier genetic modifications for optimized protein expression <Paper corpusId=\"237677625\" paperTitle=\"(Mitchell et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"209415743\" paperTitle=\"(Tripathi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This genetic tractability allows researchers to develop strains with reduced proteolytic activity, which enhances product yield and quality <Paper corpusId=\"216589014\" paperTitle=\"(Giovannoni et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the comprehensive understanding of E. coli physiology enables more precise control over expression conditions compared to more complex eukaryotic systems.\n\nWhen compared directly to mammalian cell culture systems, E. coli offers several distinct advantages. Mammalian cells grow significantly slower, are substantially more expensive to culture, exhibit greater batch-to-batch variations, and present more challenges for genetic engineering <Paper corpusId=\"57192905\" paperTitle=\"(Burdette et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. These limitations make mammalian expression systems less attractive for large-scale production of non-glycosylated proteins where E. coli's capabilities are sufficient.\n\nSimilarly, while yeast systems can perform some post-translational modifications, they typically grow more slowly than E. coli and can suffer from the aforementioned genetic instability issues <Paper corpusId=\"57192905\" paperTitle=\"(Burdette et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. For many industrial applications where simple proteins without complex modifications are required, these disadvantages outweigh the potential benefits of yeast's secretion capabilities.\n\nThe combination of these production advantages has cemented E. coli's position as the most widely used system for recombinant protein expression. Its low cost, ease of use, and efficient scalability make it the preferred host for many researchers across both academic and industrial settings <Paper corpusId=\"276480527\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge E. coli's limitations in protein production. The translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce certain post-translational modifications such as cytoplasmic disulfide bridges or glycosylation. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli have limited ability to secrete recombinant proteins into the culture medium, which can necessitate more complex purification procedures <Paper corpusId=\"216589014\" paperTitle=\"(Giovannoni et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. For applications requiring these capabilities, expression hosts with higher secretion efficiency or post-translational modification abilities, such as yeasts or mammalian cells, may be more appropriate despite their slower growth rates.",

Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. The availability of various E. coli expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms, and bioprocess technologies, makes it very attractive for industrial applications. However, the codon usage in E. coli and the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolytic processing, limit its use for the production of slightly complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals. Several new technological advancements in the E. coli expression system to meet the biotechnology industry requirements have been made, such as novel engineered strains, genetically modifying E. coli to possess capability to glycosylate heterologous proteins and express complex proteins, including full-length glycosylated antibodies. This review summarizes the recent advancements that may further expand the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex and also glycosylated proteins for therapeutic use in the future."

                            "Infectious diseases, along with cancers, are among the main causes of death among humans worldwide. The production of therapeutic proteins for treating diseases at large scale for millions of individuals is one of the essential needs of mankind. Recent progress in the area of recombinant DNA technologies has paved the way to producing recombinant proteins that can be used as therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic reagents. Recombinant proteins for these applications are mainly produced using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as mammalian cells, bacteria, yeast, insect cells, and transgenic plants at laboratory scale as well as in large-scale settings. The development of efficient bioprocessing strategies is crucial for industrial production of recombinant proteins of therapeutic and prophylactic importance. Recently, advances have been made in the various areas of bioprocessing and are being utilized to develop effective processes for producing recombinant proteins. These include the use of high-throughput devices for effective bioprocess optimization and of disposable systems, continuous upstream processing, continuous chromatography, integrated continuous bioprocessing, Quality by Design, and process analytical technologies to achieve quality product with higher yield. This review summarizes recent developments in the bioprocessing of recombinant proteins, including in various expression systems, bioprocess development, and the upstream and downstream processing of recombinant proteins."

                            "In addition to CWDEs from wild-type bacteria, recombinant CWDEs can be produced by E. coli through high cell density fermentation. Differently from other fermentation methods, high cell density fermentation is characterized by the highest operating costs (Ferreira et al., 2018). The advantage of using E. coli as bioreactor resides in five main factors: (i) rapid growth cycle, (ii) use of cheap growth media, (iii) capability of reaching high cell density through fermentation, (iv) possibility of using strains with low proteolytic activity, and (v) a thorough knowledge of its physiology and genetics. However, the translational machinery of bacteria cannot introduce post-translational modifications such as the formation of cytoplasmic disulphide bridges or glycosylation. Moreover, the poor ability of Gram-negative bacteria to secrete recombinant proteins in the culture medium implies expensive and time-consuming purification procedures, thus representing additional costs for their large-scale production (Table 2). To overcome this drawback, different approaches to enhance the secretion efficiency of recombinant CWDEs in E. coli have been developed",
                            "Alternatively, expression hosts with higher secretion capabilities can be used such as the Grampositive bacteria B. subtilis (Morello et al., 2008) or Lactococcus lactis (Pohl and Harwood, 2010), and yeasts; the latter have higher secretion efficiency and can perform post-translational modifications."
