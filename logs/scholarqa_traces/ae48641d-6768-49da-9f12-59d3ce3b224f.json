                    "text": "Single-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a highly promising biotherapeutic agent for disease treatment and prevention [1,2]. Unlike protein-based therapeutics, mRNA-based therapies deliver transcripts used by host cell machinery to produce immunogenic or functional proteins of interest [3]. Typically, mRNA transcripts are larger transcripts (>2000 b), requiring encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that protect against the environment and improve cellular uptake [4]. This mRNAbased approach has significant advantages, including the delivery of complex or low-yielding proteins [5] and facile adaptation to any target in emergency responses. The swift large-scale development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has also prompted significant discussion on assessing mRNA modalities as platform technologies instead of individual products characterized by manufacturing process and disease target [6]. Given the expected following of this novel modality, correctly identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) and reaching a consensus on the means to assess them is an area of interest for both manufacturers and quality assessors. \n\nThe early identification of CQAs in biological products is critical for maintaining safety and efficacy in a product lifecycle. However, given the complex mode of action for mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics, directly evaluating efficacy or potency can be difficult [7]. As a result, physicochemical properties related to potency-determining attributes need to be extensively characterized [8]. One such CQA is transcript length or integrity, because critical elements at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are required for efficient protein synthesis [9] and the manufacturing process necessarily results in a mixture of fragments [10]. RNA is also susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage from both spontaneous and RNAse-induced degradation. Encapsulation offers some protection, but fragmentation remains a critical concern for long-term stability [11]. Thus, as a stability-indicating CQA, it is critical that the mRNA length profile is accurately assessed over time.",

                    "text": "The analysis of mRNA-LNPs requires disruption of the protective encapsulating LNP as only free mRNA molecules can be evaluated by CGE-LIF. The profile of the released mRNA can then be visualized as a single sharp peak, containing intact mRNA, and a broad earlier eluting shoulder, containing mRNA fragments [12]. Later-migrating peaks or tailing are often attributed to other mRNA-related impurities [12,25,27]. \n\nGiven the importance of disruption in sample preparation, two common disruption protocols were evaluated. These were mRNA-LNP treatment with detergent (Triton X-100) and precipitation by organic solvent (isopropanol) [25,33,36]. After mRNA-LNP samples were disrupted by Triton X-100, fluorescence intensity of the main peak was significantly impacted, even at low detergent concentrations (Figure 2A), which also resulted in lower integrity measurements and increased variability compared to isopropanol treatment (Table 2). These observations were recapitulated with an in-house formulated FLuc-LNP sample (Figure 2B), suggesting that isopropanol precipitation removal of non-precipitating buffer components improves assay sensitivity. However, a comparison between the disrupted FLuc-LNP and untreated FLuc mRNA at matching concentrations reveal that even isopropanol precipitation disruption can incur signal or sample loss on analysis (Figure 2C), suggesting that comparisons between drug substances and drug products must be carefully interpreted. This can be only partially attributed to the lipid content of mRNA-LNP samples, as mock disruptions with RNA ladder and FLuc mRNA only were less impacted overall, though 10% Triton X-100 addition still had the greatest effect (Figure 2D and Figure S3). Because these mock disruptions were performed on naked RNA, any detergent interactions with lipids that could further interfere with the fluorescence would not be observed. Interestingly, when control RNA and mRNA-LNP samples were disrupted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, high detergent concentrations also appeared to disrupt electrophoretic mobility, causing faint bands and streakiness (Figure S4).",

                    "text": "Although this understanding is gradually forming in the biotherapeutic context for mRNA products [25,[31][32][33], many studies examine only naked mRNA [12,26,34] or use proprietary buffer formulations with closed instrumentation [35,36]. Although informative, unknown impurities may go uninvestigated due to missing components or unpredictable interactions with undisclosed components. Indeed, lipids are important to the mRNA impurity profile as Packer et al. reported the discovery of novel mRNA-lipid impurities, which were undetectable in a CGE method but present by IP-RPLC [25]. Interestingly, late-migrating impurities have been reported by CGE but only in the absence of formamide [27]. Both reports suggest that the differing method components of CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) and IP-RPLC can result in different impurity profiles, which needs to be better understood. Given the emergence of this modality and the potential for novel impurities, it will be important to establish standard methods to accurately assess known CQAs while also maintaining the means to characterize unknown impurities through customizable methods. \n\nTo address the knowledge gaps of CGE-LIF and IP-RPLC method performance for mRNA-LNPs, we used a large commercial mRNA-LNP product (\u223c4200 b) to systematically evaluate critical method parameters for CGE-LIF and compared them to IP-RPLC. Both methods have been proposed for mRNA quality assessments [27]. In this study, we first examined how common gel additivesurea, formamide, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-impacted CGE-LIF resolution of an RNA ladder. Next, we evaluated how LNP disruption affects integrity measurements for the mRNA-LNP. Leveraging these observations, an experimental design was implemented to investigate both main and interaction effects of urea, formamide, and dye percentage. CGE-LIF performance was then compared to IP-RPLC analysis. Finally, a discussion on designing methods for consistency and standardization from a biotherapeutic perspective will be presented.",

                    "text": "Although convenient instruments and kits have been marketed for mRNA-LNP analysis, the proprietary nature of these systems makes method customization and foundational research difficult. Thus, we chose an open-source CGE-LIF protocol [38] to clearly assess the impact of method parameters (Table 1). In addition to being highly accessible, a variant of this method has been proposed as an analytical procedure for integrity analysis of mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics [27]. \n\nInitial adaptation showed high reproducibility with prescribed standards: an RNA ladder (281 b-6583 b) and an RNA marker  1A). Some variation in intensity was observed, notably for the smallest 281 b fragment. On the basis of the ladder, the length of the RNA control was estimated at 2074 b, approximately 300 bases higher than the actual length; as calculated by linear regression of migration time and the natural log of RNA fragment length (Figure S1). \n\nBecause instrument parameters have been explored elsewhere [38], we focused on gel buffer additives. A characteristic property of RNA molecules is the propensity to form stable secondary structures, which interfere with size-based separations [39]. Denaturants, such as urea and formamide, are commonly used to improve resolution of large mRNA [17]. Accordingly, decreased urea concentrations in the gel buffer broadened RNA peaks and increased electrophoretic mobility, resulting in lower migration times (Figure 1B) reflecting previous reports [40]. Interestingly, the absence of urea also resulted in a large relative peak area of smaller fragments (Figure S2), which could be due to an enhanced electrokinetic injection bias. Although past studies have reported a decrease of fluorescence signal in the presence of urea [41,42], fragment-dependent impacts on intensity have not been reported to our knowledge. \n\nIn comparison, formamide is often added to samples for denaturation prior to analysis. In our hands, this treatment only showed minor improvements in peak resolution (Figure 1C) compared to without treatment (Figure 1B), suggesting that denaturation in-sample is insufficient for CGE-LIF analysis. Insample formamide also increased assay variability and decreased signal intensity.",

Analysis of the same RNA markers from Figure 1 showed generally lower resolution and sizing accuracy by IP-RPLC (Figure 4A). When RNA ladder linearity was assessed for both techniques, the migration pattern was biphasic [40] with CGE-LIF offering better separation across the entire fragment range. The resolution for IP-RPLC was overall low, but particularly for higher molecular weight (>2.5 kb) fragments. \n\nFor mRNA-LNPs, similar observations were made. Although a main peak was evident by IP-RPLC, a clear shoulder could not be clearly delineated from the main peak. Integration values also differed (Table 4). Integrity by IP-RPLC was consistently higher than CGE-LIF, likely due to its lower resolving power and broader peaks obscuring similarly sized fragments within the main peak. \n\nHowever, IP-RPLC analysis of mRNA-LNP samples disrupted with both 1% and 10% Triton X-100 clearly revealed the interference of Triton X-100 peaks with the main mRNA peak (Figure 4B), demonstrating that uncharged excipients or impurities can be efficiently detected. In comparison, in CGE-LIF, these same samples only resulted in diminished signal intensity and altered mRNA peak shape, which could lead to different conclusions of sample purity or integrity. Method accuracy would need to be determined with a well-characterized reference standard.",

                    "text": "In effect, because SYBR Green II is an intercalating dye [50], its binding to RNA could be biased based on molecular structure [42]. However, it is worth noting that both the addition of sieving polymer and in-sample formamide also reduced signal intensity without affecting denaturation, suggesting multiple mechanisms at play, including viscosity effects. \n\nEncapsulation by LNPs is a critical aspect of biotherapeutic mRNA analysis. As a result, LNP disruption is often required for product analysis [33]. Many bioanalytical studies, however, focus on naked mRNA analysis, which can overlook complex matrix interactions. To maintain relevance to biotherapeutics, we used commercial mRNA-LNP products to show that LNP disruption does have an impact on the quality profile by CGE-LIF. Common detergent disruption appeared to interfere with signal intensity and RNA mobility, negatively impacting integrity. Thus, care should be taken when interpreting analyses between detergent-disrupted mRNA-LNP samples and naked mRNA samples, such as between mRNA-LNP drug products and mRNA drug substances. Analysis of in-process intermediates should include relevant matrix controls and appropriate reference standards. \n\nRemoving non-precipitating buffer components would improve assay sensitivity. \n\nDefining the standards for comparative analyses of CGE-LIF profiles is challenging, especially in the shoulder region where a complexity of analytes can be masked in the area under the curve. Traditionally, peak areas are corrected based on the migration time of the peak; however, approaches based on identifying migration time by the peak apex may introduce variability or bias, especially when comparing \"smoother\" shoulders with fewer peaks to \"noisier\" shoulders. It may be beneficial to explore standard integration practices or the impact of alternative correction approaches such as weighted integrations. Resolution in CGE-LIF analysis of mRNA is another criteria that can be difficult to define because the shoulder contains a mixture of fragments not fully separated from the main peak. Traditional resolution metrics, such as the separation of two well-defined peaks [51], would not be applicable. Systematic approaches, such as full factorial design of experiments, allow for the comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of all factor combinations and their responses.",

Lorbetskie, Michael J. W. Johnston, Lisheng Wang, Xuguang Li, Huixin Lu\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)\u2010lipid nanoparticle (LNP) biotherapeutics have demonstrated significant promise in disease treatment and prevention given their rapidly modifiable production processes and considerable capacity to adapt to complex or low\u2010yielding proteins of interest. As a result, many products are currently being developed in this space. Critically, well\u2010characterized and appropriately designed assays are required to monitor purity and integrity in order to maintain the efficacy and consistency of these novel products. Currently, capillary gel electrophoresis with laser\u2010induced fluorescence (CGE\u2010LIF) and ion\u2010pair reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography (IP\u2010RPLC) are techniques of choice for mRNA integrity analysis. However, most methods proposed for biotherapeutic analysis have been developed using naked mRNA without LNP components or proprietary buffer formulations, which can obscure undiscovered impurities or complex interactions between mRNA and the sample matrix. In this study, we addressed these methodological challenges by using a biotherapeutically relevant commercial mRNA\u2010LNP sample (approx. 4200 b) to refine and optimize a customizable CGE\u2010LIF method currently under consideration for mRNA\u2010LNP biotherapeutic analysis. We systematically characterized how critical method parameters\u2014such as denaturant type, concentration, and usage\u2014and LNP disruption protocols can interfere with accurate mRNA integrity analysis in CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC. We found that optimal conditions for CGE\u2010LIF assay sensitivity, variability, and resolution included sample precipitation by isopropanol, high urea concentrations, no formamide as a sample diluent, and high concentrations of dye. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of both CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC are highlighted, and a discussion of key considerations when using or designing methods for mRNA integrity assessment is presented.\n## Introduction\nSingle-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a highly promising biotherapeutic agent for disease treatment and prevention [1,2]. Unlike protein-based therapeutics, mRNA-based therapies deliver transcripts used by host cell machinery to produce immunogenic or functional proteins of interest [3]. Typically, mRNA transcripts are larger transcripts (>2000 b), requiring encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that protect against the environment and improve cellular uptake [4]. This mRNAbased approach has significant advantages, including the delivery of complex or low-yielding proteins [5] and facile adaptation to any target in emergency responses. The swift large-scale development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has also prompted significant discussion on assessing mRNA modalities as platform technologies instead of individual products characterized by manufacturing process and disease target [6]. Given the expected following of this novel modality, correctly identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) and reaching a consensus on the means to assess them is an area of interest for both manufacturers and quality assessors. \n\nThe early identification of CQAs in biological products is critical for maintaining safety and efficacy in a product lifecycle. However, given the complex mode of action for mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics, directly evaluating efficacy or potency can be difficult [7]. As a result, physicochemical properties related to potency-determining attributes need to be extensively characterized [8]. One such CQA is transcript length or integrity, because critical elements at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are required for efficient protein synthesis [9] and the manufacturing process necessarily results in a mixture of fragments [10]. RNA is also susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage from both spontaneous and RNAse-induced degradation. Encapsulation offers some protection, but fragmentation remains a critical concern for long-term stability [11]. Thus, as a stability-indicating CQA, it is critical that the mRNA length profile is accurately assessed over time.\n...\nAlthough this understanding is gradually forming in the biotherapeutic context for mRNA products [25,[31][32][33], many studies examine only naked mRNA [12,26,34] or use proprietary buffer formulations with closed instrumentation [35,36]. Although informative, unknown impurities may go uninvestigated due to missing components or unpredictable interactions with undisclosed components. Indeed, lipids are important to the mRNA impurity profile as Packer et al. reported the discovery of novel mRNA-lipid impurities, which were undetectable in a CGE method but present by IP-RPLC [25]. Interestingly, late-migrating impurities have been reported by CGE but only in the absence of formamide [27]. Both reports suggest that the differing method components of CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) and IP-RPLC can result in different impurity profiles, which needs to be better understood. Given the emergence of this modality and the potential for novel impurities, it will be important to establish standard methods to accurately assess known CQAs while also maintaining the means to characterize unknown impurities through customizable methods. \n\nTo address the knowledge gaps of CGE-LIF and IP-RPLC method performance for mRNA-LNPs, we used a large commercial mRNA-LNP product (\u223c4200 b) to systematically evaluate critical method parameters for CGE-LIF and compared them to IP-RPLC. Both methods have been proposed for mRNA quality assessments [27]. In this study, we first examined how common gel additivesurea, formamide, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-impacted CGE-LIF resolution of an RNA ladder. Next, we evaluated how LNP disruption affects integrity measurements for the mRNA-LNP. Leveraging these observations, an experimental design was implemented to investigate both main and interaction effects of urea, formamide, and dye percentage. CGE-LIF performance was then compared to IP-RPLC analysis. Finally, a discussion on designing methods for consistency and standardization from a biotherapeutic perspective will be presented.\n\n## In-Gel Additives Impact CGE-LIF Signal-To-Noise and Resolution\nAlthough convenient instruments and kits have been marketed for mRNA-LNP analysis, the proprietary nature of these systems makes method customization and foundational research difficult. Thus, we chose an open-source CGE-LIF protocol [38] to clearly assess the impact of method parameters (Table 1). In addition to being highly accessible, a variant of this method has been proposed as an analytical procedure for integrity analysis of mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics [27]. \n\nInitial adaptation showed high reproducibility with prescribed standards: an RNA ladder (281 b-6583 b) and an RNA marker  1A). Some variation in intensity was observed, notably for the smallest 281 b fragment. On the basis of the ladder, the length of the RNA control was estimated at 2074 b, approximately 300 bases higher than the actual length; as calculated by linear regression of migration time and the natural log of RNA fragment length (Figure S1). \n\nBecause instrument parameters have been explored elsewhere [38], we focused on gel buffer additives. A characteristic property of RNA molecules is the propensity to form stable secondary structures, which interfere with size-based separations [39]. Denaturants, such as urea and formamide, are commonly used to improve resolution of large mRNA [17]. Accordingly, decreased urea concentrations in the gel buffer broadened RNA peaks and increased electrophoretic mobility, resulting in lower migration times (Figure 1B) reflecting previous reports [40]. Interestingly, the absence of urea also resulted in a large relative peak area of smaller fragments (Figure S2), which could be due to an enhanced electrokinetic injection bias. Although past studies have reported a decrease of fluorescence signal in the presence of urea [41,42], fragment-dependent impacts on intensity have not been reported to our knowledge. \n\nIn comparison, formamide is often added to samples for denaturation prior to analysis. In our hands, this treatment only showed minor improvements in peak resolution (Figure 1C) compared to without treatment (Figure 1B), suggesting that denaturation in-sample is insufficient for CGE-LIF analysis. Insample formamide also increased assay variability and decreased signal intensity.\n\n## LNP Disruption by Detergent Interferes With mRNA-LNP Integrity Assessment\nThe analysis of mRNA-LNPs requires disruption of the protective encapsulating LNP as only free mRNA molecules can be evaluated by CGE-LIF. The profile of the released mRNA can then be visualized as a single sharp peak, containing intact mRNA, and a broad earlier eluting shoulder, containing mRNA fragments [12]. Later-migrating peaks or tailing are often attributed to other mRNA-related impurities [12,25,27]. \n\nGiven the importance of disruption in sample preparation, two common disruption protocols were evaluated. These were mRNA-LNP treatment with detergent (Triton X-100) and precipitation by organic solvent (isopropanol) [25,33,36]. After mRNA-LNP samples were disrupted by Triton X-100, fluorescence intensity of the main peak was significantly impacted, even at low detergent concentrations (Figure 2A), which also resulted in lower integrity measurements and increased variability compared to isopropanol treatment (Table 2). These observations were recapitulated with an in-house formulated FLuc-LNP sample (Figure 2B), suggesting that isopropanol precipitation removal of non-precipitating buffer components improves assay sensitivity. However, a comparison between the disrupted FLuc-LNP and untreated FLuc mRNA at matching concentrations reveal that even isopropanol precipitation disruption can incur signal or sample loss on analysis (Figure 2C), suggesting that comparisons between drug substances and drug products must be carefully interpreted. This can be only partially attributed to the lipid content of mRNA-LNP samples, as mock disruptions with RNA ladder and FLuc mRNA only were less impacted overall, though 10% Triton X-100 addition still had the greatest effect (Figure 2D and Figure S3). Because these mock disruptions were performed on naked RNA, any detergent interactions with lipids that could further interfere with the fluorescence would not be observed. Interestingly, when control RNA and mRNA-LNP samples were disrupted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, high detergent concentrations also appeared to disrupt electrophoretic mobility, causing faint bands and streakiness (Figure S4).\n\n## IP-RPLC Assays a Different Impurity Profile From CGE-LIF\nFinally, the performance of CGE-LIF was compared to IP-RPLC, an orthogonal technique for mRNA sizing. Analysis of the same RNA markers from Figure 1 showed generally lower resolution and sizing accuracy by IP-RPLC (Figure 4A). When RNA ladder linearity was assessed for both techniques, the migration pattern was biphasic [40] with CGE-LIF offering better separation across the entire fragment range. The resolution for IP-RPLC was overall low, but particularly for higher molecular weight (>2.5 kb) fragments. \n\nFor mRNA-LNPs, similar observations were made. Although a main peak was evident by IP-RPLC, a clear shoulder could not be clearly delineated from the main peak. Integration values also differed (Table 4). Integrity by IP-RPLC was consistently higher than CGE-LIF, likely due to its lower resolving power and broader peaks obscuring similarly sized fragments within the main peak. \n\nHowever, IP-RPLC analysis of mRNA-LNP samples disrupted with both 1% and 10% Triton X-100 clearly revealed the interference of Triton X-100 peaks with the main mRNA peak (Figure 4B), demonstrating that uncharged excipients or impurities can be efficiently detected. In comparison, in CGE-LIF, these same samples only resulted in diminished signal intensity and altered mRNA peak shape, which could lead to different conclusions of sample purity or integrity. Method accuracy would need to be determined with a well-characterized reference standard.\n\n## Disruption method\nIn effect, because SYBR Green II is an intercalating dye [50], its binding to RNA could be biased based on molecular structure [42]. However, it is worth noting that both the addition of sieving polymer and in-sample formamide also reduced signal intensity without affecting denaturation, suggesting multiple mechanisms at play, including viscosity effects. \n\nEncapsulation by LNPs is a critical aspect of biotherapeutic mRNA analysis. As a result, LNP disruption is often required for product analysis [33]. Many bioanalytical studies, however, focus on naked mRNA analysis, which can overlook complex matrix interactions. To maintain relevance to biotherapeutics, we used commercial mRNA-LNP products to show that LNP disruption does have an impact on the quality profile by CGE-LIF. Common detergent disruption appeared to interfere with signal intensity and RNA mobility, negatively impacting integrity. Thus, care should be taken when interpreting analyses between detergent-disrupted mRNA-LNP samples and naked mRNA samples, such as between mRNA-LNP drug products and mRNA drug substances. Analysis of in-process intermediates should include relevant matrix controls and appropriate reference standards. \n\nRemoving non-precipitating buffer components would improve assay sensitivity. \n\nDefining the standards for comparative analyses of CGE-LIF profiles is challenging, especially in the shoulder region where a complexity of analytes can be masked in the area under the curve. Traditionally, peak areas are corrected based on the migration time of the peak; however, approaches based on identifying migration time by the peak apex may introduce variability or bias, especially when comparing \"smoother\" shoulders with fewer peaks to \"noisier\" shoulders. It may be beneficial to explore standard integration practices or the impact of alternative correction approaches such as weighted integrations. Resolution in CGE-LIF analysis of mRNA is another criteria that can be difficult to define because the shoulder contains a mixture of fragments not fully separated from the main peak. Traditional resolution metrics, such as the separation of two well-defined peaks [51], would not be applicable. Systematic approaches, such as full factorial design of experiments, allow for the comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of all factor combinations and their responses.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in mRNA technology, utilized in vaccines, immunotherapies, protein replacement therapies, and genome editing, have emerged as promising and increasingly viable treatments. The rapid, potent, and transient properties of mRNA-encoded proteins make them attractive tools for the effective treatment of a variety of conditions, ranging from infectious diseases to cancer and single-gene disorders. The capability for rapid and large-scale production of mRNA therapeutics fueled the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For effective clinical implementation, it is crucial to deeply characterize and control important mRNA attributes such as purity/integrity, identity, structural quality features, and functionality. This implies the use of powerful and advanced analytical techniques for quality control and characterization of mRNA. Improvements in analytical techniques such as electrophoresis, chromatography, mass spectrometry, sequencing, and functionality assessments have significantly enhanced the quality and detail of information available for product and process characterization, as well as for routine stability and release testing. Here, we review the latest advancements in analytical techniques for the characterization of mRNA-based therapeutics, typically employed by the biopharmaceutical industry for eventual market release.",

                    "text": "Currie et al. showed that the formed degradation products appeared as shorter RNA fragments in front of the main peak and could be well monitored, and the relative stability of the mRNA under the various stressed conditions could be assessed [50]. Moreover, Cheng et al. also reported an IP-RP LC method aiming at the identification of target circRNAs, product-related substances, and impurities [52]. Degradation patterns of circRNAs under thermal acceleration conditions and biological analysis of degradation products were investigated. Recently, a study demonstrated that both IP-RP LC and CGE techniques are effective in assessing the purity of mRNA species, revealing strong similarities in their separation patterns [30]. However, while both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression.",

Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergentbased deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. \n\nMolecules 2025, 30, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 46 \n\nwhile both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30].

A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. The main benefit of IP-RP LC over other chromatographic modes (such as AEX, SEC, and SC) is that it can be easily coupled with MS, considerably broadening its field of application. IP-RP LC-MS is often used for measuring important structural features of mRNA molecules, such as 5 \u2032 capping efficiency and 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail length [43]. Structural characterizations for the capping efficiency and the poly(A) tail by LC-MS have been recently reviewed [41,43].",

The rapid, potent, and transient properties of mRNA-encoded proteins make them attractive tools for the effective treatment of a variety of conditions, ranging from infectious diseases to cancer and single-gene disorders. The capability for rapid and large-scale production of mRNA therapeutics fueled the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For effective clinical implementation, it is crucial to deeply characterize and control important mRNA attributes such as purity/integrity, identity, structural quality features, and functionality. This implies the use of powerful and advanced analytical techniques for quality control and characterization of mRNA. Improvements in analytical techniques such as electrophoresis, chromatography, mass spectrometry, sequencing, and functionality assessments have significantly enhanced the quality and detail of information available for product and process characterization, as well as for routine stability and release testing. Here, we review the latest advancements in analytical techniques for the characterization of mRNA-based therapeutics, typically employed by the biopharmaceutical industry for eventual market release.\n## Ion-Pair Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography\nCurrie et al. showed that the formed degradation products appeared as shorter RNA fragments in front of the main peak and could be well monitored, and the relative stability of the mRNA under the various stressed conditions could be assessed [50]. Moreover, Cheng et al. also reported an IP-RP LC method aiming at the identification of target circRNAs, product-related substances, and impurities [52]. Degradation patterns of circRNAs under thermal acceleration conditions and biological analysis of degradation products were investigated. Recently, a study demonstrated that both IP-RP LC and CGE techniques are effective in assessing the purity of mRNA species, revealing strong similarities in their separation patterns [30]. However, while both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70].

We have developed a quick and reproducible microchip CE method for evaluating the % purity and % integrity of mRNA in mRNA-LNP vaccine samples. The method utilizes the LabChip GXII Touch instrument from Perkin Elmer, which allows for high-throughput sample analysis due to the short run time of \u223c 70 s per sample and can run a 96-well plate in approximately 2.5 h. These advantages are especially useful for vaccine development and the method required minimal changes for optimization of its use for additional mRNA vaccine products. Assay development was optimized mostly with respect to sample preparation since the instrument and separation kit are fixed from Perkin Elmer. Sample treatment was optimized by the addition of high formamide concentration (>80% v/v) and heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 min to ensure mRNA was fully denatured. Standard analytical parameters were assessed including specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, and LOQ. The method was successfully used to monitor the stability of mRNA in LNPs at various temperatures and is currently used for process and formulation development.",

                    "text": "In recent years, nucleic acid based technologies including messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) have been investigated extensively for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer prevention and therapy, as well as vaccines [1,2]. Although there is currently no approved DNA vaccine [3], two mRNA vaccines for the current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were granted approval for emergency human use by the FDA [4]. Compared to more traditional inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines provide several advantages including simpler and faster vaccine manufacturing. These advantages are mainly because mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes do not require growth and maintenance of host cells or live viruses that are associated with other vaccine platforms such as live or inactivated viruses or subunit protein vaccines. The mRNA used in vaccines can be prepared in an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, thereby reducing potential concerns of cell or virus related impurities. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach to improving the world's response to disease outbreaks [5]. \n\nmRNA is known to be less stable than DNA due to its susceptibility to hydrolysis and the abundance of ribonucleases. Although there are reports that naked mRNA vaccines have been shown to be stable for several months at temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C [6,7], protecting mRNA from degradation by encapsulating within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been reported [8,9]. Besides protecting mRNA from degradation, LNPs are used as a delivery mechanism to enhance antigen expression and induced T-cell response [10]. Even after the mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs, it is still necessary to monitor its stability. Hence, it is important to determine the purity of mRNA in vaccines at various stages of the vaccine manufacturing process and determine the mRNA integrity that is a measure of intactness of mRNA over time in the final drug product, which requires a stability indicating method. Demonstrating the integrity of mRNA in vaccines is critical to ensure potency of the vaccine product. \n\nOne of the key stability-indicating parameters of mRNA is degradation. mRNA is typically large, approximately 2000 nucleotides (nt), and there are limited analytical tools to measure the intact mRNA and its degradation products with good resolution.",

                    "text": "The assay is intended to measure the % purity and % integrity of mRNA contained in LNPs; therefore, standard analytical parameters were evaluated to understand assay performance before qualification. \n\nSpecificity: Specificity was assessed by running an empty LNP sample. The empty LNP sample was prepared identically to an mRNA-LNP sample of \u223c1 mg/mL mRNA, as described in Section 2.3. No peaks were observed in empty LNP sam- ples. However, visible RNA peaks were observed in the control RNA ladder and mRNA-LNP system suitability sample, indicating that LNPs do not contribute to the signal and the signal is only from RNA in the sample. \n\nAccuracy and precision: Accuracy was assessed as percent recovery and was evaluated by analyzing a mRNA-LNP sample of high purity, a mRNA-LNP sample of low purity, and a 1:1 mixture of the two. The % purity of the 1:1 mixture should theoretically be the average of the % purity of the low purity sample and the high purity sample. Two development samples were used with % purities of 71.7% and 22.9%. The 1:1 mixture of these two samples should produce a % purity of 47.4%. The observed % purity of the 1:1 mixture was 45.0%. The percent recovery was 95% (%recovery = observed % purity/theoretical % purity \u00d7 100%). The precision of the new method was obtained by performing intra-and interday assay precision measurements (n = 3). mRNA-LNP samples were prepared as described in Section 2.3. The RSD for both repeatability (intra-assay precision) and intermediate precision (interassay) for the % main peak and % fragments was <1% and <5%, respectively. \n\nLinearity: An mRNA-LNP sample was used to evaluate linearity across a range of mRNA concentrations from 2.5 to 15 \u03bcg/mL. The total peak area with respect to this range of mRNA concentrations (2.5-15 \u03bcg/mL) is plotted in Fig. 4B and a linear correlation with R 2 = 0.99 is shown. Within this range, the % main peak was also consistent as shown in Fig. 4B.",

                    "text": "Naked mRNA is known to be very unstable due to various mechanisms such as heat, metal catalyzed acid-or basic based-hydrolysis, oxidation, as well as the existence of ubiquitous RNase enzyme. Although mRNA fragmentation might follow many pathways, the first-order kinetic of bond breaking is the major mechanism of its degradation. For example, metal ions catalyzed, alkaline condition, and high temperature activates and accelerates the 2'OH in ribose to attack the neighboring phosphate group to cleave the RNA [22]. It is expected that mRNA-based vaccine products encapsulated by LNPs would give better stability protection than naked mRNA. Here, we performed a forced degradation study using heat stress at various temperatures (-20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, 45\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C) for up to 90 days. Figure 5A-C illustrates mRNA stability data from heat-stressed mRNA-LNP samples at different temperatures. An example set of electropherograms from mRNA-LNP samples at various temperatures (-70\u00b0C black trace, 37\u00b0C blue trace, 45\u00b0C red trace, and 60\u00b0C green trace) for 4 days is shown in Fig. 5A. As the temperature increased, we observed a decrease in % main peak and an increase of % fragments, which resulted in a decrease in % integrity, indicating that the mRNA encapsulated in LNPs was not stable at these higher temperatures after 4 days. The electropherograms of mRNA-LNP samples stored at -20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C are not shown but were similar to that of the -70\u00b0C (black trace), indicating that mRNA inside LNPs was stable and minimal changes in the % integrity occurred after 4 days at these temperatures. The starting % purity at time zero -70\u00b0C of the mRNA-LNP product was \u223c80% as shown by Fig. 5B. The mRNA integrity decreased with increasing temperatures due to degradation to smaller fragments. The % integrity was 0% after just a few days for the 60\u00b0C sample, after \u223c20 days for the 45\u00b0C sample, \u223c30 days for the 37\u00b0C sample, and \u223c60 days for the 25\u00b0C sample.",

Rustandi\n## Abstract\nMessenger RNA (mRNA)\u2010based vaccines are advantageous because they can be relatively quicker and more cost efficient to manufacture compared to other traditional vaccine products. Lipid nanoparticles have three common purposes: delivery, self\u2010adjuvanting properties, and mRNA protection. Faster vaccine development requires an efficient and fast assay to monitor mRNA purity and integrity. Microchip CE is known to be a robust technology that is capable of rapid separation. Here, we describe the development and optimization of a purity and integrity assay for mRNA\u2010based vaccines encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles using commercial microchip\u2010based separation. The analytical parameters of the optimized assay were assessed and the method is a stability indicating assay.\n## Introduction\nIn recent years, nucleic acid based technologies including messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) have been investigated extensively for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer prevention and therapy, as well as vaccines [1,2]. Although there is currently no approved DNA vaccine [3], two mRNA vaccines for the current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were granted approval for emergency human use by the FDA [4]. Compared to more traditional inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines provide several advantages including simpler and faster vaccine manufacturing. These advantages are mainly because mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes do not require growth and maintenance of host cells or live viruses that are associated with other vaccine platforms such as live or inactivated viruses or subunit protein vaccines. The mRNA used in vaccines can be prepared in an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, thereby reducing potential concerns of cell or virus related impurities. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach to improving the world's response to disease outbreaks [5]. \n\nmRNA is known to be less stable than DNA due to its susceptibility to hydrolysis and the abundance of ribonucleases. Although there are reports that naked mRNA vaccines have been shown to be stable for several months at temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C [6,7], protecting mRNA from degradation by encapsulating within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been reported [8,9]. Besides protecting mRNA from degradation, LNPs are used as a delivery mechanism to enhance antigen expression and induced T-cell response [10]. Even after the mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs, it is still necessary to monitor its stability. Hence, it is important to determine the purity of mRNA in vaccines at various stages of the vaccine manufacturing process and determine the mRNA integrity that is a measure of intactness of mRNA over time in the final drug product, which requires a stability indicating method. Demonstrating the integrity of mRNA in vaccines is critical to ensure potency of the vaccine product. \n\nOne of the key stability-indicating parameters of mRNA is degradation. mRNA is typically large, approximately 2000 nucleotides (nt), and there are limited analytical tools to measure the intact mRNA and its degradation products with good resolution.\n\n## Optimization of MCE sample preparation\nThe capability of microchip technology of measuring large mRNA from LNPs was first assessed by analyzing an mRNA-LNP sample that was prepared by dilution in 10% (w/v) Brij\u00ae 58 in formamide. Results are shown in Fig. 2A illustrating the mRNA main peak (lower electropherogram red trace) appears close to the expected molecular size of \u223c2000 nt and the electropherogram black trace is the RNA ladder standard containing eight RNA transcripts of 200-6000 nt. Furthermore, the instrument was tested to determine if it was capable of measuring mRNA degradation due to heat stress in a sample. Figure 2B illustrates the results of a short initial heat stress experiment that was performed by heating a mRNA-LNP sample for 4 days at 45\u00b0C (blue trace) and 60\u00b0C (red trace) in comparison with a control of the same sample stored at -70\u00b0C (black trace). The mRNA % main peak area at 49 s decreased after 4 days at 45\u00b0C and smaller sized fragments increased as multiple small peaks to the left of the main peak. After 4 days at 60\u00b0C, the sample was entirely fragmented with no main peak. The total peak areas of each trace in Fig. 2B are consistent. The group of fragment peaks is very broad and contains many smaller RNA fragments that are not resolved using this method. These data demonstrate that this method is capable of monitoring the stability of heat-stressed mRNA and detect relatively accurate molecular size. However, further sample preparation optimization needed to be evaluated in order to have a robust assay. \n\nSeveral sample preparation parameters including heating conditions, Brij\u00ae 58, formamide, and mRNA concentration were evaluated during assay optimization. The deter- gent Brij\u00ae 58 was used to solubilize LNPs and liberate the mRNA. mRNA is known to have tertiary structure and its structure can be denatured in the presence of formamide or heat. The original sample preparation conditions included a final concentration of <40% (v/v) formamide.\n\n## Analytical parameters\nThe assay is intended to measure the % purity and % integrity of mRNA contained in LNPs; therefore, standard analytical parameters were evaluated to understand assay performance before qualification. \n\nSpecificity: Specificity was assessed by running an empty LNP sample. The empty LNP sample was prepared identically to an mRNA-LNP sample of \u223c1 mg/mL mRNA, as described in Section 2.3. No peaks were observed in empty LNP sam- ples. However, visible RNA peaks were observed in the control RNA ladder and mRNA-LNP system suitability sample, indicating that LNPs do not contribute to the signal and the signal is only from RNA in the sample. \n\nAccuracy and precision: Accuracy was assessed as percent recovery and was evaluated by analyzing a mRNA-LNP sample of high purity, a mRNA-LNP sample of low purity, and a 1:1 mixture of the two. The % purity of the 1:1 mixture should theoretically be the average of the % purity of the low purity sample and the high purity sample. Two development samples were used with % purities of 71.7% and 22.9%. The 1:1 mixture of these two samples should produce a % purity of 47.4%. The observed % purity of the 1:1 mixture was 45.0%. The percent recovery was 95% (%recovery = observed % purity/theoretical % purity \u00d7 100%). The precision of the new method was obtained by performing intra-and interday assay precision measurements (n = 3). mRNA-LNP samples were prepared as described in Section 2.3. The RSD for both repeatability (intra-assay precision) and intermediate precision (interassay) for the % main peak and % fragments was <1% and <5%, respectively. \n\nLinearity: An mRNA-LNP sample was used to evaluate linearity across a range of mRNA concentrations from 2.5 to 15 \u03bcg/mL. The total peak area with respect to this range of mRNA concentrations (2.5-15 \u03bcg/mL) is plotted in Fig. 4B and a linear correlation with R 2 = 0.99 is shown. Within this range, the % main peak was also consistent as shown in Fig. 4B.\n\n## stability\nNaked mRNA is known to be very unstable due to various mechanisms such as heat, metal catalyzed acid-or basic based-hydrolysis, oxidation, as well as the existence of ubiquitous RNase enzyme. Although mRNA fragmentation might follow many pathways, the first-order kinetic of bond breaking is the major mechanism of its degradation. For example, metal ions catalyzed, alkaline condition, and high temperature activates and accelerates the 2'OH in ribose to attack the neighboring phosphate group to cleave the RNA [22]. It is expected that mRNA-based vaccine products encapsulated by LNPs would give better stability protection than naked mRNA. Here, we performed a forced degradation study using heat stress at various temperatures (-20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, 45\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C) for up to 90 days. Figure 5A-C illustrates mRNA stability data from heat-stressed mRNA-LNP samples at different temperatures. An example set of electropherograms from mRNA-LNP samples at various temperatures (-70\u00b0C black trace, 37\u00b0C blue trace, 45\u00b0C red trace, and 60\u00b0C green trace) for 4 days is shown in Fig. 5A. As the temperature increased, we observed a decrease in % main peak and an increase of % fragments, which resulted in a decrease in % integrity, indicating that the mRNA encapsulated in LNPs was not stable at these higher temperatures after 4 days. The electropherograms of mRNA-LNP samples stored at -20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C are not shown but were similar to that of the -70\u00b0C (black trace), indicating that mRNA inside LNPs was stable and minimal changes in the % integrity occurred after 4 days at these temperatures. The starting % purity at time zero -70\u00b0C of the mRNA-LNP product was \u223c80% as shown by Fig. 5B. The mRNA integrity decreased with increasing temperatures due to degradation to smaller fragments. The % integrity was 0% after just a few days for the 60\u00b0C sample, after \u223c20 days for the 45\u00b0C sample, \u223c30 days for the 37\u00b0C sample, and \u223c60 days for the 25\u00b0C sample.\n\n## Concluding remarks\nWith recent advances in mRNA-based vaccines, it is essential to have a method that is capable of monitoring the purity and integrity of mRNA. We have developed a quick and reproducible microchip CE method for evaluating the % purity and % integrity of mRNA in mRNA-LNP vaccine samples. The method utilizes the LabChip GXII Touch instrument from Perkin Elmer, which allows for high-throughput sample analysis due to the short run time of \u223c 70 s per sample and can run a 96-well plate in approximately 2.5 h. These advantages are especially useful for vaccine development and the method required minimal changes for optimization of its use for additional mRNA vaccine products. Assay development was optimized mostly with respect to sample preparation since the instrument and separation kit are fixed from Perkin Elmer. Sample treatment was optimized by the addition of high formamide concentration (>80% v/v) and heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 min to ensure mRNA was fully denatured. Standard analytical parameters were assessed including specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, and LOQ. The method was successfully used to monitor the stability of mRNA in LNPs at various temperatures and is currently used for process and formulation development.",

                    "text": "The following section covers the analytical principles used to assess the purity and the stability of the mRNA, both in aqueous solution as a drug substance as well as formulated in (or extracted from) the LNP as a drug product. Molecular size, physical and chemical properties of the mRNA pose a significant analytical challenge. Due to the large size of the mRNA, the number of negative charges, and the structural similarity of degradation products (compared to the main component), several powerful separation techniques are required to assess the stability. Intact mRNA is too large for MS detection, therefore, any analytical method using MS for characterization requires a digestion step prior to any analysis. Consequently, bioinformatics requirements for interpreting MS data increase. \n\nA common method to characterize the integrity of the mRNA, i.e., to measure the purity and impurity profile, is IP-RPLC-UV (ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection). 76,49 A reversed-phase stationary phase together with a mobile phase containing ion-pair reagent enables retention and separation of the negatively charged mRNA. The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size  restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating. \n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection.",

For example, pre-clinical work is focused on characterization of materials, understanding the processes, and development of the analytical methods themselves, especially for such new and complex drug products as mRNA-LNPs. During early clinical subsequent stages of development, the purpose of analysis can vary from in-depth characterization of impurities and degradation products, to monitoring the known and proposed critical quality attributes (CQAs) of batches derived from different processes during scale-up. In the late-stage development phase, this emphasis of analysis will shift to batch release, stability studies and establishment of shelf-lives. 39,40 Regulatory agencies also recognize that during different stages of development the depth of product knowledge varies, and thus different quality criteria (i.e., specifications) are appropriate for each analytical method.

In order to implement this approach, a thorough understanding of process parameters (Critical Process Parameters, CPPs), analytical methods, and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) is also required. 42 To ensure rapid regulatory convergence of the currently approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, they were developed under a more conventional Quality-by-Testing paradigm due to the unprecedented speed with which they were developed and the fact that these products were \"first-in-class\".\n\n## Tests and Methods Typically Used for Stability Assessment of mRNA\nThe following section covers the analytical principles used to assess the purity and the stability of the mRNA, both in aqueous solution as a drug substance as well as formulated in (or extracted from) the LNP as a drug product. Molecular size, physical and chemical properties of the mRNA pose a significant analytical challenge. Due to the large size of the mRNA, the number of negative charges, and the structural similarity of degradation products (compared to the main component), several powerful separation techniques are required to assess the stability. Intact mRNA is too large for MS detection, therefore, any analytical method using MS for characterization requires a digestion step prior to any analysis. Consequently, bioinformatics requirements for interpreting MS data increase. \n\nA common method to characterize the integrity of the mRNA, i.e., to measure the purity and impurity profile, is IP-RPLC-UV (ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection). 76,49 A reversed-phase stationary phase together with a mobile phase containing ion-pair reagent enables retention and separation of the negatively charged mRNA. The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size  restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating. \n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection.\n...\ninally, the total content of the RNA needs to be controlled. For the drug substance this can be measured with UV absorbance readings at 260 nm. In addition, for LNP-based drug products, the encapsulation efficiency is a critical quality attribute. For the RNA quantification in LNPs, the Quant-it RiboGreen reagent (Thermofisher) characterization is widely used, because it can differentiate between RNA inside and outside the LNP to calculate a percentage encapsulated RNA, which is not straightforward with other methods. 82",

Guerrini, Dora Mehn, Diletta Scaccabarozzi, S. Gioria, L. Calzolai\n## Abstract\nThe approval of safe and effective LNP-mRNA vaccines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is catalyzing the development of the next generation of mRNA therapeutics. Proper characterization methods are crucial for assessing the quality and efficacy of these complex formulations. Here, we show that analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) can measure, simultaneously and without any sample preparation step, the sedimentation coefficients of both the LNP-mRNA formulation and the mRNA molecules. This allows measuring several quality attributes, such as particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency and density of the formulation. The technique can also be applied to study the stability of the formulation under stress conditions and different buffers.\n## Introduction\nLipid Nanoparticles-encapsulated mRNA (LNPs-mRNA) have played a pivotal role in the global response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with proven safety and efficacy, and are now at various stages of development against a variety of other infectious diseases or studied for cell and gene therapies [1][2][3][4][5][6].\n\nLNP-mRNA formulations used in Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines contain four different lipids and the cargo, a ribonucleic molecule, encoding a protein intended to elicit an immune response, in case of vaccines, or to treat aberrantly expressed gene(s), in case of genetic diseases.\n\nVarious studies demonstrated that the proper assembly and stability of LNPs are particularly crucial for their safety and efficacy [7][8][9].We have also previously published a characterization cascade suggested to address key challenges in the preclinical characterization and identify potential pitfalls during the LNPs-mRNA synthesis [10].\n\nThe implementation of a structured characterization strategy contributes to improve RNA therapeutics quality and reduces development times, a critical aspect, especially in response to emerging pathogen outbreaks [10,11].\n\nThe size of the LNPs-mRNA particles and the amount of encapsulated mRNA are two critical quality attributes strongly related to in vitro potency.Based on recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q2R2 guidance documents applicable to LNP-mRNA formulation, for the validation of the measurement of complex quality attributes, a combination of orthogonal techniques that ideally applies different measurement principles is recommended [12,13].\n\nAnalytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) has been applied as a sizing method for macromolecules [14][15][16][17][18] although the technique has broader applications including nanomaterials [19][20][21][22] and liposomes [23].\n...\nAnalytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) has been applied as a sizing method for macromolecules [14][15][16][17][18] although the technique has broader applications including nanomaterials [19][20][21][22] and liposomes [23].It separates particles based on their sedimentation velocity and the resulting sedimentation coefficient distributions are a function of the mass, density and shape of each particle population present in the sample.\n\nAUC has been already applied to study LNPs formulations [24][25][26].LNPs-mRNA have densities lower than 1 (typically between 0.9 and 1 g/mL), thus floating, rather than sedimenting, during the centrifugal separation.Existing software can handle such systems: data analysis of floating particles gives distributions in the negative sedimentation coefficient regime [24].This can be transformed to size distribution if the density of the particles is known or calculated by running several measurements at various liquid densities [7,26].Up to now, data analysis is performed considering either only the positive range of sedimentation coefficients (sedimenting particles) or the negative range (floating particles).This is limiting, in fact LNP-mRNA formulation contains components with densities smaller than 1 (all the lipids) and higher than 1 (the mRNA) and the current type of analysis cannot detect the presence of both types of components in a single analysis.Here, we show that it is possible to simultaneously detect components floating and sedimenting within a single AUC experiment.\n\nThis opens up the capacity of AUC to measure the integrity of the LNP-mRNA systems and, simultaneously, the eventual amount of free mRNA, thus providing valuable information on the quality of the starting material, the encapsulation of the mRNA molecules, and the possibility to follow changes caused by stressors such as temperature and storage.Furthermore, this technique does not require any sample preparation apart from a dilution in a suitable buffer, which allows the running of measurements under physiological conditions.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n(A) (B) AUC is a robust method for measuring the particle size distribution of LNP-mRNA formulations, underpinned by extensive scientific literature [20,28,29] and existing protocols [25,[27][28][29][30].The application of the technique requires quite substantial instrument and expertise investment, but very limited sample preparation and relatively small efforts in terms of time needed for parameter optimization and data analysis.\n\nAUC can detect both the floating and the sedimenting fractions of any LNP-mRNA formulation.As described earlier and supported also by standard methods, it allows determination of particle densities and, using these density values, the size distribution profiling of a sample [7,[31][32][33].Moreover, as it is shown here, the technique can also discriminate the mRNA encapsulated in the LNP formulations from the non-encapsulated free mRNA molecules or mRNA-lipid adducts.\n\n## Conclusions\nAUC is a robust method for measuring the particle size distribution of LNP-mRNA formulations, underpinned by extensive scientific literature [14,19,20] and existing protocols [25,30].The application of the technique requires quite substantial instrument and expertise investment, but very limited sample preparation and relatively small efforts in terms of time needed for parameter optimization and data analysis.\n\nAUC is able to detect not only the floating but also the sedimenting fractions in LNP-mRNA formulations.This opens new perspectives in the application of the technique as it could be used not only for size distribution profiling of LNPs, but also to reveal the presence of sedimenting sub-population(s) in the sample and to discriminate the mRNA encapsulated in the LNP formulations from the non-encapsulated free mRNA molecules, or possibly, mRNA-lipid adducts.\n\nThe technique requires a relatively low amount of sample and no sample preparation (apart from dilution step).This is extremely important as it avoids any potential bias in the results that could be introduced by ultrafiltration steps, RNA extraction, or particle disruption that are needed when using other analytical techniques.The simplicity of the sample preparation and the specific detection of the signal from the RNA molecule (using the UV detector at 260 nm) also allow the characterization of LNP-mRNA in physiologically relevant media [34].\n\nThese results show that AUC is a very useful technique for the characterization of LNP-mRNA formulations and provide an additional technique for the quality assessment of this class of advanced therapeutics.",

This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC.

LNP stability and bilayer fluidity are determined by the identities and the amounts of the various lipids employed in the formulation and LNP efficacy is determined in large part by the lipid composition which usually contains a cationic lipid, a PEG\u2010lipid conjugate, cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid. Analytical methods developed for LNP characterization must be able to determine not only the identity and content of each individual lipid component (i.e., the parent lipids), but also the associated impurities and degradants. In this work, we describe an efficient and sensitive reversed\u2010phase chromatographic method with charged aerosol detection (CAD) suitable for this purpose. Sample preparation diluent and mobile phase pH conditions are critical and have been optimized for the lipids of interest. This method was validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity for lipid analysis to support process and formulation development for new drugs and vaccines.\n## Introduction\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been used for a variety of applications throughout the years such as therapeutics [1], delivery system [2], vaccines [3], and adjuvants [3]. Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.\n...\nIn this article, we describe the development of a robust and efficient UHPLC-CAD method using commercially available materials and instrumentation is described for lipid analysis of mRNA loaded lipid nanoparticles used in vaccine candidates. Though three of the lipids mentioned in this article are proprietary and cannot be disclosed, this methodology is valuable to highlight in the growing field of mRNA-LNP technology. In addition to chromatography conditions, sample preparation diluent is also discussed due to its importance for accurate lipid quantitation. This method was validated using standard analytical parameters such as linearity, specificity, range, accuracy, and precision. Finally, an example lipid stability study is reported using the UHPLC-CAD method.\n\n## Concluding remarks\nAn efficient and sensitive reverse-phase UHPLC-CAD method was developed for the analysis of lipid components of mRNA encapsulated lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in order to support process and formulation development studies and clinical material release and stability testing. The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times. We think this method will be a beneficial contribution to the growing interest LNP technologies -not only in vaccines, but also therapeutics and there drug candidates utilizing this technology. \n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to Dr Adam Socia and Dr Ping Zhuang for providing critical review to the manuscript.

In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.",

                    "text": "LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals are comprised of various chemically diverse molecules that are brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex. Molecular and compositional analysis of them can thus be quite challenging. Nevertheless, analytical approaches are coming to be established and liquid chromatography is becoming increasingly relied upon. \n\nAlthough there have been significant advances in all types of LNP mRNA analyses, we have focused here on the use of AEX, IP-RP, oligo mapping, 5' endcap testing and lipid compositional assays. Separations by AEX and IP-RP are predicted to be majorly important to the detection of heterogeneity and for checking molecular integrity. Various modes of elution can be applied for AEX including a classical salt gradient, ionpairing gradient, and ion-pair mediated salt gradient. Both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions can be used, and each has its advantages and limitations. Beside the stationary phases, column hardware itself may have a huge impact on solute recovery and carryover and thus on the reproducibility of the measurements. Therefore, PEEK or h-HST column hardware are preferred over common stainlesssteel columns. When it comes to method optimization, mobile phase temperature, composition and pH are known have a huge impact on the quality of the separations and thus need to be optimized for each specific sample. Intact mRNA analysis via IP-RP assays has the potential to become an essential characterization tool for mRNA, but more progress is needed in order to extend the capabilities of this method for the detection of larger molecules up to 10,000 nt long. That IP-RP can uniquely resolve hydrophobic variants suggests that it may become a mainstay as an mRNA stability indicating assay. \n\nOther analyzes of LNP mRNA drug substances and products, such as 5' endcap analysis, oligo mapping and lipid compositional assays, are equally important. The 5'-end of an mRNA can be selectively cleaved via a duplexing probe and RNase H, and the resulting digestion products can be quantified by IP-RP with UV and/or MS detection. Moreover, ribonucleases can be applied to partially digest mRNA so that it can be possible to map and deeply interrogate its molecular composition.",

Detailed analysis of mRNA for sequence alterations, adduct verification and full sequence confirmation will require ribonucleases of complementary specificity and ribonucleases capable of generating intermediate size digestion products that can be more optimally separated and sequenced by LC-MS. Further efforts on enzyme technology and data interpretation software are warranted. The composition of the lipid components in the LNP must also be analyzed. This can be achieved by disrupting or destabilizing the LNP-mRNA formulation. Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations. Lipids are amenable to reversed-phase chromatography and can be detected with universal detectors, such as CAD and ELSD modules. With this, it is possible to quantify percent composition and to monitor for degradants. LC coupled to HRMS is also important because it allows the simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities for a heightened level of information during drug development and/or quality control. We hope each of the above topics have shed light on some of the very important ways in which LC-based methods have aided the development of the first generation of LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals. New progress on analytical tools for LNP mRNA are bound to be realized along with further clinical success, and the field of separation science appears to be at the heart of future efforts.",

Fekete, C. Doneanu, Balasubrahmayam Addepalli, Maissa M. Gaye, Jennifer Nguyen, B. Alden, R. Birdsall, Duanduan Han, G. Isaac, M. Lauber\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nA schematic representation of a four-component lipid nanoparticle is provided in Fig. 2. \n\nThe use of LNP mRNA has proven to be highly effective for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but therapeutic applications expand well beyond just vaccines [8]. In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.\n...\nIn addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug. Lipids can be dissolved from an LNP using a solvent based extraction so that they can then be individually analyzed by reversed phase chromatography. In addition to LC, capillary electrophoresis is also well established for assessing mRNA purity and integrity [11,12]. \n\nThough there have been a considerable number of developments in the analysis of LNP mRNA, this review focuses on AEX and IP-RP liquid chromatography for intact mRNAs, oligo mapping analysis, 5' endcap testing and lipid compositional assays. With new insights emerging from SEC, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), we are sure more topics will come to be covered in future reviews.\n\n## Conclusion and perspectives\nLNP mRNA pharmaceuticals are comprised of various chemically diverse molecules that are brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex. Molecular and compositional analysis of them can thus be quite challenging. Nevertheless, analytical approaches are coming to be established and liquid chromatography is becoming increasingly relied upon. \n\nAlthough there have been significant advances in all types of LNP mRNA analyses, we have focused here on the use of AEX, IP-RP, oligo mapping, 5' endcap testing and lipid compositional assays. Separations by AEX and IP-RP are predicted to be majorly important to the detection of heterogeneity and for checking molecular integrity. Various modes of elution can be applied for AEX including a classical salt gradient, ionpairing gradient, and ion-pair mediated salt gradient. Both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions can be used, and each has its advantages and limitations. Beside the stationary phases, column hardware itself may have a huge impact on solute recovery and carryover and thus on the reproducibility of the measurements. Therefore, PEEK or h-HST column hardware are preferred over common stainlesssteel columns. When it comes to method optimization, mobile phase temperature, composition and pH are known have a huge impact on the quality of the separations and thus need to be optimized for each specific sample. Intact mRNA analysis via IP-RP assays has the potential to become an essential characterization tool for mRNA, but more progress is needed in order to extend the capabilities of this method for the detection of larger molecules up to 10,000 nt long. That IP-RP can uniquely resolve hydrophobic variants suggests that it may become a mainstay as an mRNA stability indicating assay. \n\nOther analyzes of LNP mRNA drug substances and products, such as 5' endcap analysis, oligo mapping and lipid compositional assays, are equally important. The 5'-end of an mRNA can be selectively cleaved via a duplexing probe and RNase H, and the resulting digestion products can be quantified by IP-RP with UV and/or MS detection. Moreover, ribonucleases can be applied to partially digest mRNA so that it can be possible to map and deeply interrogate its molecular composition.\n...\nMoreover, ribonucleases can be applied to partially digest mRNA so that it can be possible to map and deeply interrogate its molecular composition. Detailed analysis of mRNA for sequence alterations, adduct verification and full sequence confirmation will require ribonucleases of complementary specificity and ribonucleases capable of generating intermediate size digestion products that can be more optimally separated and sequenced by LC-MS. Further efforts on enzyme technology and data interpretation software are warranted. The composition of the lipid components in the LNP must also be analyzed. This can be achieved by disrupting or destabilizing the LNP-mRNA formulation. Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations. Lipids are amenable to reversed-phase chromatography and can be detected with universal detectors, such as CAD and ELSD modules. With this, it is possible to quantify percent composition and to monitor for degradants. LC coupled to HRMS is also important because it allows the simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities for a heightened level of information during drug development and/or quality control. We hope each of the above topics have shed light on some of the very important ways in which LC-based methods have aided the development of the first generation of LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals. New progress on analytical tools for LNP mRNA are bound to be realized along with further clinical success, and the field of separation science appears to be at the heart of future efforts.",

Markova, Stefan Cairns, Hanna Jankevics-Jones, M. Kaszuba, F. Caputo, J. Parot\n## Abstract\nNovel vaccine platforms for delivery of nucleic acids based on viral and non-viral vectors, such as recombinant adeno associated viruses (rAAV) and lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), hold great promise. However, they pose significant manufacturing and analytical challenges due to their intrinsic structural complexity. During product development and process control, their design, characterization, and quality control require the combination of fit-for-purpose complementary analytical tools. Moreover, an in-depth methodological expertise and holistic approach to data analysis are required for robust measurements and to enable an adequate interpretation of experimental findings. Here the combination of complementary label-free biophysical techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle-DLS (MADLS), Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), multiple detection SEC and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have been successfully used for the characterization of physical and chemical attributes of rAAV and LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Methods\u2019 performance, applicability, dynamic range of detection and method optimization are discussed for the measurements of multiple critical physical\u2212chemical quality attributes, including particle size distribution, aggregation propensity, polydispersity, particle concentration, particle structural properties and nucleic acid payload.\n",

Results: The results show that all manufacturing methods can produce LNPs with sizes ranging between 95 and 215 nm with high encapsulation (70\u2013100%), and enhanced analytics showed variations between the LNPs produced using the different mixers.

            "abstract": "The new era of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines has led to development of a novel, state-of-the-art characterization method for this class of molecules. Currently, flow cytometry-based assays with antigen-specific antibodies are utilized for monitoring in-vitro expression (IVE) of mRNA. Here we present development, optimization, and application of an in-vitro expression liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (IVE-LC/MS/MS) assay as an orthogonal method to IVE-flow cytometry that can be used for in-depth characterization of the expressed protein antigens and monitoring their relative expression levels in the cell post-mRNA transfection. The IVE-LC/MS/MS assessment accomplished the detection of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens of four distinct strains simultaneously. The workflow is presented here, highlighting the optimization of all necessary steps required for protein purification and mass spectrometry method setup. The IVE-LC/MS/MS assay is a robust and versatile technique that complements the IVE-flow cytometry method and offers several advantages, such as being antibody-free, capable of multiplexing, and highly sensitive and selective. The various studies in this work, including evaluating dose\u2013response relationships, refining transfection protocols, and examining mRNA-LNP stability under various conditions showcase the significant benefits of applying IVE-LC/MS/MS across different experimental settings. IVE-LC/MS/MS is a powerful tool for understanding and improving the performance and quality of mRNA LNPs.",

All mRNA-LNP formulations contained PEG-lipids to avoid LNP aggregation and provided sufficient encapsulation efficiency to mitigate mRNA degradation by external factors. Additionally, degradation was prevented by minimizing sample manipulation during assay execution and sample shipment. Samples were stored under frozen or refrigerated conditions and liquid samples were shipped with minimal headspace to reduce potential sample degradation. In case of multivalent mRNA-LNP drug products correct mRNA ratios were assured at formulation level and verified by adequate release testing.",

Friese\n## Abstract\nThe new era of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines has led to development of a novel, state-of-the-art characterization method for this class of molecules. Currently, flow cytometry-based assays with antigen-specific antibodies are utilized for monitoring in-vitro expression (IVE) of mRNA. Here we present development, optimization, and application of an in-vitro expression liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (IVE-LC/MS/MS) assay as an orthogonal method to IVE-flow cytometry that can be used for in-depth characterization of the expressed protein antigens and monitoring their relative expression levels in the cell post-mRNA transfection. The IVE-LC/MS/MS assessment accomplished the detection of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens of four distinct strains simultaneously. The workflow is presented here, highlighting the optimization of all necessary steps required for protein purification and mass spectrometry method setup. The IVE-LC/MS/MS assay is a robust and versatile technique that complements the IVE-flow cytometry method and offers several advantages, such as being antibody-free, capable of multiplexing, and highly sensitive and selective. The various studies in this work, including evaluating dose\u2013response relationships, refining transfection protocols, and examining mRNA-LNP stability under various conditions showcase the significant benefits of applying IVE-LC/MS/MS across different experimental settings. IVE-LC/MS/MS is a powerful tool for understanding and improving the performance and quality of mRNA LNPs.\n## www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nThe results from the stability study of quadrivalent mRNA LNPs, as depicted in Fig. 5, revealed similar trending between IVE-LC/MS/MS and IVE-flow cytometry.

Its superior performance makes it an invaluable asset for detailed antigen analysis, offering direct and precise measurements that complement IVE-flow cytometry. Our data showed that LC/MS/MS and flow cytometry results are trending similarly, underscoring the complementary nature of these techniques. While peptide-based workflows like IVE-LC/MS/MS are essential for certain aspects, flow cytometry is required when assessing the higher-order structural aspects vital to vaccine efficacy. Thus, the IVE-LC/MS/MS method is developed as an orthogonal characterization method to IVE-flow cytometry. The superior quantitation The various studies in this work demonstrate the values of applying IVE-LC/MS/MS in different experimental settings, from assessing dose-response relationships, understanding transfection protocols to evaluating the stability of mRNA-LNP under varying stability and buffer conditions.\n\n## Materials\nIn this study, we utilized a range of high-quality reagents and antigens to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our results. Specifically, we employed Native Antigen mRNA-LNP drug product formulations were sourced from internal programs. mRNA-LNP material used for studies in this manuscript were in-house produced using a formulation process similar to the one described in reference 30 . All mRNA-LNP formulations contained PEG-lipids to avoid LNP aggregation and provided sufficient encapsulation efficiency to mitigate mRNA degradation by external factors. Additionally, degradation was prevented by minimizing sample manipulation during assay execution and sample shipment. Samples were stored under frozen or refrigerated conditions and liquid samples were shipped with minimal headspace to reduce potential sample degradation. In case of multivalent mRNA-LNP drug products correct mRNA ratios were assured at formulation level and verified by adequate release testing.",

EEinput% is shown to be\u2009<\u200950% for all formulations tested, when EE% is consistently\u2009>\u200985%. We also compared formulations for LNP size (Z-average) and polydispersity index (PDI). LNP size does not appear to be strongly influenced by cargo size, which is a counterintuitive finding. Thoughtful characterization of LNPs, in parallel with consideration of in vitro or in vivo behavior, will guide design and optimization for better understanding and improvement of future RNA therapeutics.\n## Encapsulation efficiency based on input RNA concentration\nWhile there are a handful of methods to characterize encapsulation efficiency of an LNP formulation for its cargo, modified RiboGreen assay is by far the most common [25][26][27][28][29][30] .

All mRNA-LNP formulations contained PEG-lipids to avoid LNP aggregation and provided sufficient encapsulation efficiency to mitigate mRNA degradation by external factors. Additionally, degradation was prevented by minimizing sample manipulation during assay execution and sample shipment. Samples were stored under frozen or refrigerated conditions and liquid samples were shipped with minimal headspace to reduce potential sample degradation.

            "text": "The assay is intended to measure the % purity and % integrity of mRNA contained in LNPs; therefore, standard analytical parameters were evaluated to understand assay performance before qualification. \n\nSpecificity: Specificity was assessed by running an empty LNP sample. The empty LNP sample was prepared identically to an mRNA-LNP sample of \u223c1 mg/mL mRNA, as described in Section 2.3. No peaks were observed in empty LNP sam- ples. However, visible RNA peaks were observed in the control RNA ladder and mRNA-LNP system suitability sample, indicating that LNPs do not contribute to the signal and the signal is only from RNA in the sample. \n\nAccuracy and precision: Accuracy was assessed as percent recovery and was evaluated by analyzing a mRNA-LNP sample of high purity, a mRNA-LNP sample of low purity, and a 1:1 mixture of the two. The % purity of the 1:1 mixture should theoretically be the average of the % purity of the low purity sample and the high purity sample. Two development samples were used with % purities of 71.7% and 22.9%. The 1:1 mixture of these two samples should produce a % purity of 47.4%. The observed % purity of the 1:1 mixture was 45.0%. The percent recovery was 95% (%recovery = observed % purity/theoretical % purity \u00d7 100%). The precision of the new method was obtained by performing intra-and interday assay precision measurements (n = 3). mRNA-LNP samples were prepared as described in Section 2.3. The RSD for both repeatability (intra-assay precision) and intermediate precision (interassay) for the % main peak and % fragments was <1% and <5%, respectively. \n\nLinearity: An mRNA-LNP sample was used to evaluate linearity across a range of mRNA concentrations from 2.5 to 15 \u03bcg/mL. The total peak area with respect to this range of mRNA concentrations (2.5-15 \u03bcg/mL) is plotted in Fig. 4B and a linear correlation with R 2 = 0.99 is shown. Within this range, the % main peak was also consistent as shown in Fig. 4B.",

            "text": "In this section, we focus on the analytical methods used to assess the stability of mRNA and mRNA-LNP drug products during their clinical development (leading towards eventual market approval), rather than providing an exhaustive description of all published methods for mRNA and LNP characterization. 38 The analytical toolbox for mRNA and mRNA-LNP characterization will evolve during the progression from pre-clinical development to clinical trials to regulatory approval and the purpose and requirements will be different for each stage of development. For example, pre-clinical work is focused on characterization of materials, understanding the processes, and development of the analytical methods themselves, especially for such new and complex drug products as mRNA-LNPs. During early clinical subsequent stages of development, the purpose of analysis can vary from in-depth characterization of impurities and degradation products, to monitoring the known and proposed critical quality attributes (CQAs) of batches derived from different processes during scale-up. In the late-stage development phase, this emphasis of analysis will shift to batch release, stability studies and establishment of shelf-lives. 39,40 Regulatory agencies also recognize that during different stages of development the depth of product knowledge varies, and thus different quality criteria (i.e., specifications) are appropriate for each analytical method. This is commonly referred to as 'stageappropriate characterization' in which all the accumulated experience from the development stage work should ultimately be the basis for setting the quality criteria for ultimate market approval. The dynamics of this analytical development process are exemplified in the Comirnaty Public Assessment Report where it is mentioned that during the rolling review of the data, additional characterization data and tests were requested before final approval. 41 n a recent review, a Quality-by-Design (QbD) framework for future development, design and control of manufacturing processes for mRNA and LNP products was proposed. In order to implement this approach, a thorough understanding of process parameters (Critical Process Parameters, CPPs), analytical methods, and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) is also required. 42 To ensure rapid regulatory convergence of the currently approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, they were developed under a more conventional Quality-by-Testing paradigm due to the unprecedented speed with which they were developed and the fact that these products were \"first-in-class\".",

Detailed analysis of mRNA for sequence alterations, adduct verification and full sequence confirmation will require ribonucleases of complementary specificity and ribonucleases capable of generating intermediate size digestion products that can be more optimally separated and sequenced by LC-MS. Further efforts on enzyme technology and data interpretation software are warranted. The composition of the lipid components in the LNP must also be analyzed. This can be achieved by disrupting or destabilizing the LNP-mRNA formulation. Oftentimes, a simple dilution with an alcohol is an effective starting point, but some fine tuning may be needed for specialized formulations. Lipids are amenable to reversed-phase chromatography and can be detected with universal detectors, such as CAD and ELSD modules. With this, it is possible to quantify percent composition and to monitor for degradants. LC coupled to HRMS is also important because it allows the simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities for a heightened level of information during drug development and/or quality control. We hope each of the above topics have shed light on some of the very important ways in which LC-based methods have aided the development of the first generation of LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals. New progress on analytical tools for LNP mRNA are bound to be realized along with further clinical success, and the field of separation science appears to be at the heart of future efforts.",

In another promising application, Verve Therapeutics is exploring the use of LNP mRNA to deliver a CRISPR/-Cas9 complex to patient cells that will then edit a protein in the liver and correspondingly reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein [9]. Given that an LNP encapsulated mRNA drug is comprised of various chemically diverse molecules brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex, there is a major analytical burden on developers to demonstrate that drug substances and products are pure, stable, safe, effective, robustly designed and reproducibly manufactured. Considerations for mRNA testing are quite different than those previously made for other nucleic acid therapeutics, too. Different than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, the impurity profile of in vitro transcribed mRNA can include nucleotide triphosphates, DNA plasmids and their residual components, as well as various enzymes [10]. To this end, much like liquid chromatography (LC) has been a workhorse for the analytical testing of protein therapeutics, it is also becoming a relied upon technique for LNP mRNA analyses. \n\nIn one case, LC techniques can be applied to analyze the intact mRNA drug substance. Separations by anion exchange (AEX), ion-pair reversed phase (IP-RP) or size exclusion (SEC) chromatography are typically applied and are used to detect heterogeneity or check for molecular integrity. AEX and SEC can also be applied to the LNP encapsulated mRNA. With nuclease digested nucleic acid, it is possible to map the digested components while confirming sequence information, detecting post/co-transcriptional modifications, and investigating nucleobase modifications. It has also become common practice to test lipid and nucleotide raw materials by LC to check for impurities prior to their use in manufacturing. In addition, it has become important to study all of these molecular components even after they have become part of the LNP mRNA drug.",

The purity determination method by RP-HPLC typically involves a high column temperature and the use of an ion-pairing agent in combination with an organic solvent. 12 he integrity determination of mRNA by CGE involves the use of high amounts of a denaturing agent, i.e., 4\u22128 M urea or formamide under nonaqueous conditions. 13,14 In both methods, the harsh denaturing conditions used prevent detection of noncovalent aggregates. \n\nThe sizes of mRNA and LNP are usually between 100 and 500 \u00c5 15,16 and between 600 and 1000 \u00c5, 17 respectively. The large size requires the use of SEC columns with ultrawide pores, which pose heightened challenges with regard to column particle stability. The stability of a packed bed strongly depends on the average pore diameter and has to be carefully considered when large pore particles are packed. 18 The Zenix SEC-300 column (300 \u00c5 pore size) and SRT SEC-1000 column (1000 \u00c5 pore size) are indicated for the determination of mRNA aggregates. 14 However, aggregates of mRNA and LNPs would be unlikely to be chromatographically resolved on these columns, given that they are larger than both of these pore sizes.",

Similarly to the AAV samples, it is an attribute used for determination of dosing and in potency analysis. The mRNA payload of the mRNA-LNPs is presented in the results differently compared to how the load of ssDNA cargo is presented for AAV samples. Rather than doing further calculations, the weight fraction of mRNA can be used as is to keep track of the overall amount of mRNA being delivered in a given dose. The two mRNA-LNP samples were characterized with similar values of the mRNA payload, where mRNA-LNP1 was shown to have a weight fraction mRNA of 8.8 \u00b1 0.25%, and mRNA-LNP2 was shown to have a decreased weight fraction of mRNA of 7.6 \u00b1 0.26%. In addition to the average results the weight fraction of mRNA was presented as a function of the retention volume (Figure 9). In Figure 9a,b, the weight fraction mRNA is seen to change with retention volume. It is observed that in both mRNA-LNP samples the larger, higher molecular weight particles which elute at earlier retention volumes contain more mRNA. The mRNA payload decreases as the particles continue to elute. This provides an insight into the range of weight fraction of mRNA present in the mRNA-LNP samples.",

            "text": "With recent advances in mRNA-based vaccines, it is essential to have a method that is capable of monitoring the purity and integrity of mRNA. We have developed a quick and reproducible microchip CE method for evaluating the % purity and % integrity of mRNA in mRNA-LNP vaccine samples. The method utilizes the LabChip GXII Touch instrument from Perkin Elmer, which allows for high-throughput sample analysis due to the short run time of \u223c 70 s per sample and can run a 96-well plate in approximately 2.5 h. These advantages are especially useful for vaccine development and the method required minimal changes for optimization of its use for additional mRNA vaccine products. Assay development was optimized mostly with respect to sample preparation since the instrument and separation kit are fixed from Perkin Elmer. Sample treatment was optimized by the addition of high formamide concentration (>80% v/v) and heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 min to ensure mRNA was fully denatured. Standard analytical parameters were assessed including specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, and LOQ. The method was successfully used to monitor the stability of mRNA in LNPs at various temperatures and is currently used for process and formulation development.",

            "text": "The stability of LNP mRNA formulations circulating in the biological systems is a determining factor for their activity. Therefore, the ability of mRNA coding for GFP in LNPs comprising 40 mol % helper lipid to endure degradation in vitro when incubated in serum, relative to a formulation containing 10 mol % helper lipid content, was investigated. For this, GFP mRNA encapsulated in 10% DSPC (MC3-50%) and 40% ESM (MC3-33%) were incubated in 50% FBS for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h at 5 mM dose. Naked GFP mRNA and MC3-33% were also incubated in 50% FBS and PBS and acted as negative and positive controls, respectively. At the indicated time points, mRNA was extracted from the LNP mRNA formulations following the manufacturer's instructions using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Extracted RNAs were also loaded into an RNA Chip kit and mRNA integrity was determined by automated electrophoresis using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Electropherograms of the mRNA samples were generated and Agilent 2100 Expert Software (Agilent Technologies) was used to determine mRNA qual-ity in the formulation following incubation in PBS or serum. Following the manufacturer's instructions, mRNA integrity was determined using the individual electropherograms generated by drawing appropriate regions including the peak corresponding to the intact mRNA consistent with the 996 nucleotidet GFP mRNA size and the region indicating degradation of mRNA. A ratio between the intact and the degraded mRNA was generated and expressed as percent corrected area, a function that factorizes the speed of mRNA migration. The ratio of corrected area at 0 time point whereby the mRNA was assumed intact, was considered 100%, and any change toward degradation was calculated relative to this value.",

            "text": "The FDA has published a 'Guidance for industry for liposome drug products' in 2018 83 but a similar document that is directly applicable to RNA-LNP drug products is not yet available. Prior to the approval of the mRNA vaccines, the only documented example was the registration of Onpattro \u00d2 , the first LNP-siRNA product approved. 84 The major differences between liposomal drug products and RNA-LNPs (both siRNA and mRNA) are the internal structure of the particle and the complexity of the API. As discussed before, for the mRNA-LNP products, analytical methods related to the possible interaction of the ionizable lipid and the API were requested. In addition, FDA and EMA guidelines state that for the characterization of novel excipients such as ionizable lipids or novel PEG-lipids, the level of detail provided in the submission should be comparable to that for a drug substance. 85,86 or determination of the purity and stability of lipids in the LNP, methods based on LC with CAD (charged aerosol detection) are most common, as the lipid components tend to lack a UV chromophore. Chromatographic conditions can be chosen such that the four main lipid components and their degradation products are separated. 87 he work by Kinsey et al. also includes an example of how stress testing, or a forced degradation study could be conducted for the lipid components. For detailed characterization of lipid impurities and lipid degradation products, additional analytical detection techniques based on mass spectrometry are required. 88 The identification and quantification of secondary oxidation degradation products of the lipids by LC-MS methods has been described by Abeyrathne et al. 89 For measurement of hydroperoxide levels in the lipids, methods based on iodometric titration, UV spectroscopy, chromatography, among other techniques, have been summarized. 90 ethods for the detailed characterization of the proprietary lipid components and their oxidation/degradation products are still emerging. Recently, an application note was published describing the use of electron-activated dissociation (EAD) to distinguish the oxidative impurities from ionizable lipids with great resolution and sensitivity. 73",

            "text": "The following section covers the analytical principles used to assess the purity and the stability of the mRNA, both in aqueous solution as a drug substance as well as formulated in (or extracted from) the LNP as a drug product. Molecular size, physical and chemical properties of the mRNA pose a significant analytical challenge. Due to the large size of the mRNA, the number of negative charges, and the structural similarity of degradation products (compared to the main component), several powerful separation techniques are required to assess the stability. Intact mRNA is too large for MS detection, therefore, any analytical method using MS for characterization requires a digestion step prior to any analysis. Consequently, bioinformatics requirements for interpreting MS data increase. \n\nA common method to characterize the integrity of the mRNA, i.e., to measure the purity and impurity profile, is IP-RPLC-UV (ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection). 76,49 A reversed-phase stationary phase together with a mobile phase containing ion-pair reagent enables retention and separation of the negatively charged mRNA. The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size  restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating. \n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection.",

            "text": "Currie et al. showed that the formed degradation products appeared as shorter RNA fragments in front of the main peak and could be well monitored, and the relative stability of the mRNA under the various stressed conditions could be assessed [50]. Moreover, Cheng et al. also reported an IP-RP LC method aiming at the identification of target circRNAs, product-related substances, and impurities [52]. Degradation patterns of circRNAs under thermal acceleration conditions and biological analysis of degradation products were investigated. Recently, a study demonstrated that both IP-RP LC and CGE techniques are effective in assessing the purity of mRNA species, revealing strong similarities in their separation patterns [30]. However, while both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression.",

            "text": "mRNA is large, negatively charged, single stranded, highly sensitive to degradation by nucleases, prone to structural heterogeneity, and subject to a variety of chemical modifications, even if efforts are made to improve its stability. In addition to the evaluation of quality attributes tested with traditional therapeutic modalities (i.e., appearance, pH, osmolality, endotoxin levels, bioburden, and sterility), mRNA possesses unique attributes that need to be fully characterized such as its integrity (i.e., full-length mRNA), identity (i.e., sequence confirmation), quality (i.e., capping efficiency and poly(A) tail elements to ensure appropriate stability and protein translation efficiency in vivo), impurities (i.e., double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for its potential to activate an innate immune response), and functionality (i.e., in vitro translation and cell-based assays), as depicted in Figure 1. Therefore, a comprehensive analytical strategy is essential to ensure the safety, efficacy, and consistency of mRNA products throughout development and manufacturing. Generally speaking, mRNA medicines must possess a sufficient level of purity, as underscored by documents leaked from the European Medicines Agency that expressed concerns over unexpectedly low quantities (>55%) of intact mRNA in batches of the vaccine developed for commercial production [7]. To ensure the integrity and purity of mRNA therapeutics, tools like the fragment bioanalyzer and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) are used to assess RNA lengths and size distribution. In parallel, ion-pair reversedphase liquid chromatography (IP-RP LC) further aids in the separation of mRNA from impurities based on hydrophobic interactions, while size exclusion chromatography (SEC) can help in identifying aggregates based on size separation. \n\nFor identity, various molecular biology techniques are employed. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) -Sanger Sequencing is the conventional method used to confirm the open reading frame sequence. Oligonucleotide mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and direct RNA sequencing provide detailed information on sequence and chemical modifications.",

            "text": "; the IEX-HPLC outcome correlated better with the in vivo readout than the RiboGreen data. This illustrates that even established techniques like the RiboGReen assay should be carefully validated on a case-by-case basis (Schariter et al., 2019). mRNA degradation can also be analyzed by using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). This approach quantifies the total amount of mRNA that can be transcribed into intact cDNA targets for PCR. This means that all degradation that prevents this can be quantified indirectly. In their evaluation of this technique, Brisco and Morley argue that it gives reliable quantitative results (Brisco and Morley, 2012). Another advantage of this method is that all types of degradation that affect transcription are taken into account, whereas the previously discussed techniques only look at mRNA size. However, RT-qPCR sometimes is less reliable due to the error rate of the enzymes that are used (Schmid, 2017). Other disadvantages of this approach are that it is not widely used and the different types of degradation cannot be distinguished from each other. mRNA expression in vitro (in cells) is also used to analyze the integrity of mRNA (Zhang et al., 2020b;Zhao et al., 2020). By using mRNA that encodes a fluorescent protein, the mRNA integrity can indirectly be determined by measuring the fluorescence signal. This approach can assist in providing guiding principles for bioactive mRNA-LNP design and formulation development studies. Alternatively, the translation efficacy of mRNA encoding non-fluorescent antigens can be determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or western blotting techniques as has been used previously to analyze the stability of mRNA encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al., 2020b). Advantages of this approach are that it gives the sum of the overall integrity of the formulation and everything that can influence the transcription of the mRNA. Disadvantages of this method are that it is not very precise, unable to show the type of mRNA damage, and time-consuming.",

            "text": "In recent years, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)\u2010lipid nanoparticle (LNP) biotherapeutics have demonstrated significant promise in disease treatment and prevention given their rapidly modifiable production processes and considerable capacity to adapt to complex or low\u2010yielding proteins of interest. As a result, many products are currently being developed in this space. Critically, well\u2010characterized and appropriately designed assays are required to monitor purity and integrity in order to maintain the efficacy and consistency of these novel products. Currently, capillary gel electrophoresis with laser\u2010induced fluorescence (CGE\u2010LIF) and ion\u2010pair reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography (IP\u2010RPLC) are techniques of choice for mRNA integrity analysis. However, most methods proposed for biotherapeutic analysis have been developed using naked mRNA without LNP components or proprietary buffer formulations, which can obscure undiscovered impurities or complex interactions between mRNA and the sample matrix. In this study, we addressed these methodological challenges by using a biotherapeutically relevant commercial mRNA\u2010LNP sample (approx. 4200 b) to refine and optimize a customizable CGE\u2010LIF method currently under consideration for mRNA\u2010LNP biotherapeutic analysis. We systematically characterized how critical method parameters\u2014such as denaturant type, concentration, and usage\u2014and LNP disruption protocols can interfere with accurate mRNA integrity analysis in CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC. We found that optimal conditions for CGE\u2010LIF assay sensitivity, variability, and resolution included sample precipitation by isopropanol, high urea concentrations, no formamide as a sample diluent, and high concentrations of dye. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of both CGE\u2010LIF and IP\u2010RPLC are highlighted, and a discussion of key considerations when using or designing methods for mRNA integrity assessment is presented.",

            "text": "Post-manufacture monitoring of LNPs is essential for ensuring the stability and efficacy of LNP-based formulations. While CQAs such as particle size play a crucial role in formulation performance, assessing the integrity of the lipid and payload components is equally important. To achieve this, in addition to testing in vitro and in vivo efficacy, a cell-free protein expression system was employed to evaluate mRNA expression levels following extraction from LNPs, while HPLC-ELSD analysis was used to assess lipid integrity and ensure high lipid recovery (Figure 4). cell-free protein expression system was employed to evaluate mRNA expression levels following extraction from LNPs, while HPLC-ELSD analysis was used to assess lipid integrity and ensure high lipid recovery (Figure 4). Regardless of the manufacturing method used for LNPs, all formulations had total recoveries greater than 75%, with individual lipid recoveries ranging between 73 and 100% (Figure 4a), and all formulations resulted in mass ratios similar to the expected mass ratio-varying with <2% error across lipids (Figure 4b). This ensures that, although some product loss is inevitable, it occurs at the same rate across all lipid components. Unequal loss, particularly of critical components such as the ionizable lipid, could significantly compromise LNP functionality. Finally, extracted mRNA from the formulations was then used to treat CFPE systems at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, and this showed similar results to in vitro testing with no significant differences in expression levels (Figure 4c). These results confirm that low-cost microfluidic mixers do not compromise the integrity or functionality of LNPs. Regardless of the manufacturing method used for LNPs, all formulations had total recoveries greater than 75%, with individual lipid recoveries ranging between 73 and 100% (Figure 4a), and all formulations resulted in mass ratios similar to the expected mass ratio-varying with <2% error across lipids (Figure 4b).

The current study first demonstrates the effect of heat degradation on transcript translatability and then describes a novel enzymatic approach to assess the integrity of conventional mRNA and long self-amplifying mRNA. By first hybridizing oligo-T to the poly(A) tail of intact mRNA and subsequently digesting the unhybridized RNA fragments with a 3\u2019-5\u2019 exoribonuclease, individual nucleotides can be selectively released from RNA fragments. The adenosine-based fraction of these nucleotides can then be converted into ATP and detected by luminescence as a sensitive indicator of mRNA byproducts. We developed a polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)-based assay that offers fast and sensitive evaluation of mRNA integrity, regardless of its length, thus presenting a novel and fully scalable alternative to chromatographic-, electrophoresis-, or sequencing-based techniques.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize mRNA and LNP aggregates and plasmid topological forms and multimers by SEC. Prototype SEC columns packed with sub-5 \u03bcm particles and ultrawide pore morphologies were utilized to achieve these results. The physicochemical properties of the SEC packing materials were systematically evaluated. It was found that their average pore size and pore size distribution are well suited to the analysis of mRNA, LNP aggregates, and plasmid topological forms and multimers. \n\nSignificant differences in aggregate content (59.7 vs 17.8%) were observed for EGFP mRNA supplied by different manufacturers. Interestingly, most aggregates from vendor B were dissociated or may reform at a very slow kinetic rate upon heat treatment. On the same time scale, the main mRNA peak area increased 3.3-fold. The degradation trends of a pDNA (3.2 kbps) were compared using SEC and AEC. The information provided by orthogonal chromatographic modes enabled the identification of open-circular and multimer impurities that would have remained ambiguous when characterized by a singular method. The comparison of AEC and SEC profiles revealed a multistep degradation process involving the formation of (1) open-circular forms, (2) large multimers and insoluble species, and (3) fragments. Lower sample carryover was observed using SEC in comparison to AEC. \n\nMultiple critical attributes of complex mRNA-LNP samples conjugated to Fab ligands were investigated using the ultrawide pore SEC columns. The mRNA was separated from the intact LNPs. Correlations between SEC elution time and size measured by DLS were established for two LNP series (R 2 > 0.96). Further identification of a prepeak eluting before the main peak of LNPs conjugated to Fab ligands was performed using SEC-MALS-dRI, suggesting the presence of particle aggregates.",

            "text": "Therapeutic drugs and multivalent vaccines based on the delivery of mRNA via lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technologies are expected to dominate the biopharmaceutical industry landscape in the coming years. Many of these innovative therapies include several nucleic acid components (e.g., nuclease mRNA and guide RNA) posing unique analytical challenges when monitoring the quantity and quality of each individual payload substance in the formulated LNP. Current methods were optimized for single payload analysis and often lack resolving power needed to investigate nucleic acid mixtures. Ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are increasingly being used to characterize nucleic acids. Here, we studied their application for payload quantification in formulated LNP drug-like products. Using a detergent to disrupt the LNPs, the liberated payloads can be separated on an octadecyl RP column using a fast gradient. Reproducible results were obtained as lipids, and surfactants were efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, we also established an online SEC disruption analysis of the mRNA/LNPs wherein an alcohol and detergent containing a mobile phase was applied. Such conditions universally deformulated all tested LNP samples, indicating that a 5 min-long SEC separation can be used as a high-throughput platform method. In both approaches, the measurements facilitate a multiattribute analysis. Apart from quantitation, the characterization of specific impurities is achieved: IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, while SEC informs on size variants, which in turn reduces a laboratory\u2019s analytical workload. These easy-to-adopt LC-based assays are expected to fortify the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics.",

            "text": "The capability of microchip technology of measuring large mRNA from LNPs was first assessed by analyzing an mRNA-LNP sample that was prepared by dilution in 10% (w/v) Brij\u00ae 58 in formamide. Results are shown in Fig. 2A illustrating the mRNA main peak (lower electropherogram red trace) appears close to the expected molecular size of \u223c2000 nt and the electropherogram black trace is the RNA ladder standard containing eight RNA transcripts of 200-6000 nt. Furthermore, the instrument was tested to determine if it was capable of measuring mRNA degradation due to heat stress in a sample. Figure 2B illustrates the results of a short initial heat stress experiment that was performed by heating a mRNA-LNP sample for 4 days at 45\u00b0C (blue trace) and 60\u00b0C (red trace) in comparison with a control of the same sample stored at -70\u00b0C (black trace). The mRNA % main peak area at 49 s decreased after 4 days at 45\u00b0C and smaller sized fragments increased as multiple small peaks to the left of the main peak. After 4 days at 60\u00b0C, the sample was entirely fragmented with no main peak. The total peak areas of each trace in Fig. 2B are consistent. The group of fragment peaks is very broad and contains many smaller RNA fragments that are not resolved using this method. These data demonstrate that this method is capable of monitoring the stability of heat-stressed mRNA and detect relatively accurate molecular size. However, further sample preparation optimization needed to be evaluated in order to have a robust assay. \n\nSeveral sample preparation parameters including heating conditions, Brij\u00ae 58, formamide, and mRNA concentration were evaluated during assay optimization. The deter- gent Brij\u00ae 58 was used to solubilize LNPs and liberate the mRNA. mRNA is known to have tertiary structure and its structure can be denatured in the presence of formamide or heat. The original sample preparation conditions included a final concentration of <40% (v/v) formamide.",

            "text": "However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergentbased deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. \n\nMolecules 2025, 30, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 46 \n\nwhile both methods are capable of detecting the presence of an mRNA variant without a poly(A) tail and discriminating species containing a partial poly(A) tail in the pre-peak region, the distinction becomes clear for impurities present in the post-peak region, where CGE exhibits higher resolution due to its stronger denaturation conditions than IP-RP LC [30]. This study also highlights the importance of using orthogonal methods to monitor a single quality attribute such as purity, offering a greater guarantee of detecting minor impurities [30]. \n\nMoreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies [67,68]. To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles.",

We also report on 'real life' experience of the stability of marketed mRNA vaccines published in the public domain so far. A brief discussion of packaging is also included, mainly due to the lack of published data on this important aspect to date. \n\nSensitive and selective analytical techniques are required to monitor the integrity of mRNA and mRNA-LNP complexes. Therefore, a section of this review is devoted to a discussion of the state-of-theart analytical toolbox especially in the context of stability-indicating methods. Finally, there are two topics that are not covered in this review. \u221212 In contrast, the focus of this review is a topic that has not gained the same attention: the long-term and in-use stability issues with mRNA formulated as drug product. Second, only few references to small interfering RNA (siRNA) formulation studies are provided due to their limited applicability to mRNA formulations. Compared to mRNA, siRNA is a short and uniformly structured, and it frequently contains replacements at the 2'-OH on ribose to provide a more chemically stable analog, e.g., 2'-F or 2'-OMe). As a result, marketed siRNA products can be stored as liquid formulations in a refrigerator, e.g., Onpattro \u00d2 . 13 e mRNA Molecule Chemical Components of the mRNA Structure Natural and IVT-transcribed mRNAs are delicate, high molecular weight (MW), macromolecules that are rich with specific information required for in vivo performance that can be easily lost by chemical degradation along the mRNA strand.

Due to the nature of LNPs, it is possible to see some mRNA grafted on the outer part of the vesicles: of course, this mRNA will not be functional due to exposure to the outer side of the vesicles. To remove unencapsulated mRNA (both the one released after dialysis and the one grafted outside the LNPs) from the quantification, the signal from intact LNPs was subtracted from the signal obtained from burst LNPs. LNP samples were first diluted 1:100 in 1\u00d7 TE buffer, followed by 50 \u03bcL of each diluted sample added to either 50 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 TE buffer or 100 \u03bcL of 2% Triton-X in 1\u00d7 TE buffer (this step ensures bursting of LNPs). RNA standard curve, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 \u03bcg/mL, was prepared using a combination of 2% Triton-X 100 in 1\u00d7 TE buffer and 1\u00d7 TE buffer as the diluent. All samples were run in duplicate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. Ribogreen reagent was diluted 1:100 in 1\u00d7 TE buffer with 100 \u03bcL added to each well. Following a 10 min incubation at room temperature, the plate was read at E x /E m of 480 nm/520 nm. \n\nThe stability of the encapsulated mRNA was assessed for 28 days postsynthesis. First, the RNA was extracted from LNPs by using a lithium chloride precipitation method to evaluate mRNA integrity. Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of empty or loaded LNPs were mixed with 300 \u03bcL of lithium chloride in pure ethanol (34 mg/mL solution). The solution was centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min (4 \u00b0C). After the supernatant was removed, the pellet was dissolved in 500 \u03bcL of 70% ethanol in RNasefree water, and another centrifugation (12,000g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) step followed.",

            "text": "Formulating lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA products is a critical step in developing mRNA-based therapeutics, including mRNA vaccines and gene therapies. LNPs are lipidbased nanoparticles that encapsulate mRNA molecules, protect them from degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and enable efficient mRNA delivery into cells. The formulation of LNP mRNA products involves several key components and steps. \n\nLipid selection: The choice of lipids is a crucial factor in LNP formulation. Different lipids with varying properties, such as cationic, ionizable, and PEGylated lipids, can form LNPs with distinct characteristics. For example, cationic lipids provide a positive charge to LNPs, enhancing cellular uptake, while ionizable lipids allow for the efficient release of mRNA within cells. In addition, PEGylated lipids can improve the stability and pharmacokinetics of LNPs. mRNA encapsulation: The mRNA molecule carries the genetic information to be delivered into cells and is encapsulated within LNPs. mRNA is complexed with the lipids through electrostatic interactions, forming a lipid-mRNA complex that protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation in the extracellular environment. \n\nFormulation optimization: The formulation of LNPs is optimized to achieve desired characteristics, such as particle size, charge, and stability. Particle size is an important parameter that affects cellular uptake, biodistribution, and immune response. The surface charge of LNPs can also be controlled by adjusting the composition and ratio of lipids, which can influence their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. \n\nSterilization and quality control: To ensure product safety, LNPs intended for clinical use must be manufactured under sterile conditions. Sterilization methods, such as filtration or gamma irradiation, may be used to eliminate potential contaminants. In addition, quality control tests, including particle size analysis, encapsulation efficiency, and endotoxin testing, are performed to ensure the quality and consistency of LNP mRNA products. \n\nStorage and stability: LNPs are typically stored at low temperatures, such as \u221220 \u2022 C or \u221280 \u2022 C, to maintain stability and prevent degradation.",

Fig. 6 indicates that DOG-IM4 LNPs retained most of their in vivo bioactivity (<20% loss) after 25 weeks of storage at 4 \u2022 C, while in the same conditions, L319 and MC3 LNPs lost more than 80% of their bioactivity (Fig. 6, Panel E). At 25 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C, hEPO expression from the DOG-IM4 LNPs declined rapidly over 3 weeks but appeared to remain stable for at least one week at 25 \u2022 C (Fig. 6, Panel A). The limitation of these observations being the inherent variability of a bioactivity assay performed in different mice at different points in time, we tried to correlate these observations with an evolution of the physicochemical characteristics of the LNPs. The loss of bioactivity upon storage at 25 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C was found to correlate with an accelerated mRNA degradation at these temperatures as assessed by performing fragment analysis on the mRNA after extraction from the LNPs (Fig. 6, Panel B). An apparent increase in DOG-IM4 LNP average particle size from 130 to 150 nm, which correlated with mRNA degradation when the LNPs were stored at 25 \u2022 C and 37 \u2022 C was also observed (Fig. 6, Panel C). There was no apparent change in mRNA encapsulation (Fig. 6, Panel D) and LNP lipid integrity (Fig. 7) during this accelerated stability study. Note that mRNA integrity analysis could not be performed on L319 and MC3 LNPs due to poor mRNA extraction yields from these LNPs. The other physicochemical parameters of the L319 and MC3 LNPs (particle sizes, mRNA encapsulation and lipid integrity), however, remained stable over the 25-week storage period at 4 \u2022 C (data not shown).\n\nBased on the outstanding stability of DOG-IM4 LNPs and the high and homogeneous HI titers obtained with DOG-IM4 and",

The final chromatographic conditions consisted of a step gradient with two isocratic holds after various chromatographic conditions were explored during method development. \n\nPotential degradants such as myristic acid, lyso-PC 1 and 2, and stearic acid are more hydrophilic than their parent lipids and eluted in the first isocratic hold. The four main lipid components are highly hydrophobic and eluted in the second isocratic hold. Two isocratic holds were chosen to minimize the effect of each analytes response factor based on mobile phase composition [20]. Impurities or degradants were monitored by loss of four main lipid peaks and percent impurity analysis for any addition of new, unspecified peaks. Percent impurity analysis was performed by integrating any peaks apart from the void, system, and parent lipid peaks. This analysis was monitored and compared in stability studies to the zero time point. As previously mentioned, based on the relative response of each analyte, the universal response of both parent lipids and their degradants are not achievable with this method. It would be worth exploring this method with the use of an inverse gradient or another means to a more universal response for impurity analysis utilizing a CAD. \n\nFigure 2A shows the separation of an mRNA-LNP sample containing PEG-DMG, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1, and DSPC.

            "text": "In recent years, nucleic acid based technologies including messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasmid DNA (pDNA) have been investigated extensively for treatment of genetic disorders, cancer prevention and therapy, as well as vaccines [1,2]. Although there is currently no approved DNA vaccine [3], two mRNA vaccines for the current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were granted approval for emergency human use by the FDA [4]. Compared to more traditional inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines, mRNA vaccines provide several advantages including simpler and faster vaccine manufacturing. These advantages are mainly because mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes do not require growth and maintenance of host cells or live viruses that are associated with other vaccine platforms such as live or inactivated viruses or subunit protein vaccines. The mRNA used in vaccines can be prepared in an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, thereby reducing potential concerns of cell or virus related impurities. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach to improving the world's response to disease outbreaks [5]. \n\nmRNA is known to be less stable than DNA due to its susceptibility to hydrolysis and the abundance of ribonucleases. Although there are reports that naked mRNA vaccines have been shown to be stable for several months at temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C [6,7], protecting mRNA from degradation by encapsulating within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has been reported [8,9]. Besides protecting mRNA from degradation, LNPs are used as a delivery mechanism to enhance antigen expression and induced T-cell response [10]. Even after the mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs, it is still necessary to monitor its stability. Hence, it is important to determine the purity of mRNA in vaccines at various stages of the vaccine manufacturing process and determine the mRNA integrity that is a measure of intactness of mRNA over time in the final drug product, which requires a stability indicating method. Demonstrating the integrity of mRNA in vaccines is critical to ensure potency of the vaccine product. \n\nOne of the key stability-indicating parameters of mRNA is degradation. mRNA is typically large, approximately 2000 nucleotides (nt), and there are limited analytical tools to measure the intact mRNA and its degradation products with good resolution.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a key platform for delivering mRNA vaccines and therapeutics with numerous innovative drugs under development. However, characterizing these complex and unstable products remains challenging. Developing fast, reliable methods to assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the mRNA component is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these medicines. Currently, evaluating key CQAs, such as mRNA integrity and encapsulation efficiency, often involves a labor-intensive manual extraction protocol, which requires LNP disruption prior to analysis. However, these additional offline steps contribute to mRNA degradation and measurement uncertainties, highlighting the urgent need for rapid and effective methods capable of performing an online LNP disruption. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) might offer a promising solution to address this need. Due to the presence of high concentrations of organic solvent and the possibility to work at elevated temperatures, HILIC might enable on-column disruption of LNPs while preserving the full integrity of the mRNA payload, facilitating a streamlined characterization process. To evaluate this, we developed two proof of concept HILIC methods. The first one disrupts LNPs and retains the mRNA payload using a high percentage of organic solvent and elevated temperatures. The second one, relying on milder conditions, retains only the unencapsulated mRNA, which can be used to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency. Both methods were used on Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines and on Sanofi\u2019s in-development mRNA product as model samples. Our preliminary findings suggest that HILIC holds potential for online LNP disruption, mRNA integrity assessment, and encapsulation efficiency analysis. They also highlight the limitations of small-pore-sized columns currently available on the market.",

Despite the extended refrigeration period, the DMKD-PS LNPs demonstrated minimal size changes, unlike other particles that exhibited significant size alterations. Observing the size of mRNAcaptured LNPs at refrigeration temperature over 16 weeks, DMKD-PS shows consistent size, indicating structural stability. This outcome arises from the strong binding between mRNA and LNPs, which maintains their structural integrity over time. Notably, factors such as particle size and stability are influenced by the binding ratio of nucleic acids to lipid carriers [36], underscoring the importance of this interaction in determining the physical properties of the LNPs. These results demonstrate that DMKD-PS LNPs not only effectively protect mRNA from RNase A degradation but also maintain their stable structures and mRNA protection capability, even after prolonged refrigeration. \n\neffectively protect mRNA from RNase A degradation but also maintain their s structures and mRNA protection capability, even after prolonged refrigeration.",

Most recently, mRNA and LNP technology is being evaluated and approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as a delivery vehicle for two of the leading vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic [4]. In the past, this technology was utilized for RSV vaccine candidates such as V171 (mRNA-1777) [5] and preclinical vaccine development for VZV (mRNA-1278) [6]. For any of these applications, the LNP formulation typically consists of multiple lipids. \n\nIn this paper, we consider LNPs for mRNA delivery formulated with four types of lipids: a cationic lipid with an amine functional group that interacts with mRNA via ionic interactions (Cationic Lipid 1 or Cationic Lipid 2), a PEG (Polyethylene glycol)-lipid conjugate (PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene) or PEG Lipid 2), cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)). Quantitation of the individual lipids is required to support process and formulation development and are key quality attributes for manufacture. Chemical stability of each lipid is also important for clinical and safety studies and quality assurance. Lipid chemical degradation could lead to LNP aggregation and degradation during storage [7,8]. Therefore, a robust, stability-indicating analytical tool was required to support clinical development and the following commercialization.",

Currently, numerous clinical trials are being investigated using diverse applications of mRNA therapeutics for infectious diseases of viral or bacterial pathogens, for cancers, and more. 4 RNA drug product delivery in vivo is generally achieved after encapsulating mRNA in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vesicle to protect the nucleic acid cargo as it is shuttled through the cell membrane for the final translation into protein antigen. Unfortunately, this mRNA encapsulation step introduces a new analytical measurement challenge\ufffdensuring full mRNA extraction from the LNP vesicle before quantification. Encapsulation also introduces the necessity to measure mRNA quantity twice within a drug development process\ufffd within and without LNP\ufffdrequiring additional time and capabilities. Not surprisingly, extraction approaches and measurement platforms are not uniform within the mRNA community, and no shared reference material is currently available to harmonize approaches to bring measurements into concordance. \n\nTherapeutics are becoming more complex\ufffdfrom small, pure synthetic chemical derivatives to mixtures of proteins, to nucleic acid oligomers with complex structure and increased heterogeneity, and to micrometer-sized cell-based therapies.

For mRNA therapeutics, the quantity of active substance (i.e., naked mRNA) is commonly assessed using UV spectroscopy, RT-qPCR, or RT-dPCR, whereas the drug product (LNP-mRNA) is commonly assessed by fluorescencebased assays expressed in terms of encapsulation efficiency (free mRNA/total mRNA). 5 While UV spectroscopy is both fast and inexpensive, it lacks well-defined calibration, can be nonspecific, and depends on the estimates of molar absorptivity coefficients. 6 PCR-based techniques, while specific, are limited by RNA-to-cDNA conversion efficiency and are traceable to the enzymes, primers, or initiation steps used, which may change over time or setting.",

            "text": "LNP mRNA pharmaceuticals are comprised of various chemically diverse molecules that are brought together in a sophisticated intermolecular complex. Molecular and compositional analysis of them can thus be quite challenging. Nevertheless, analytical approaches are coming to be established and liquid chromatography is becoming increasingly relied upon. \n\nAlthough there have been significant advances in all types of LNP mRNA analyses, we have focused here on the use of AEX, IP-RP, oligo mapping, 5' endcap testing and lipid compositional assays. Separations by AEX and IP-RP are predicted to be majorly important to the detection of heterogeneity and for checking molecular integrity. Various modes of elution can be applied for AEX including a classical salt gradient, ionpairing gradient, and ion-pair mediated salt gradient. Both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions can be used, and each has its advantages and limitations. Beside the stationary phases, column hardware itself may have a huge impact on solute recovery and carryover and thus on the reproducibility of the measurements. Therefore, PEEK or h-HST column hardware are preferred over common stainlesssteel columns. When it comes to method optimization, mobile phase temperature, composition and pH are known have a huge impact on the quality of the separations and thus need to be optimized for each specific sample. Intact mRNA analysis via IP-RP assays has the potential to become an essential characterization tool for mRNA, but more progress is needed in order to extend the capabilities of this method for the detection of larger molecules up to 10,000 nt long. That IP-RP can uniquely resolve hydrophobic variants suggests that it may become a mainstay as an mRNA stability indicating assay. \n\nOther analyzes of LNP mRNA drug substances and products, such as 5' endcap analysis, oligo mapping and lipid compositional assays, are equally important. The 5'-end of an mRNA can be selectively cleaved via a duplexing probe and RNase H, and the resulting digestion products can be quantified by IP-RP with UV and/or MS detection. Moreover, ribonucleases can be applied to partially digest mRNA so that it can be possible to map and deeply interrogate its molecular composition.",

The sample preparation and chromatographic conditions were optimized to fully recover and separate the main lipids and their potential degradants. This method was validated to be linear, precise, accurate, and specific for two LNP formulations: PEG-DMG, cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 1 and DSPC, and PEG Lipid 2, Cholesterol, Cationic Lipid 2, and DSPC. This robust separation makes the method ideal for future work to support mRNA-LNP vaccines or other LNP containing drug candidate development for measuring lipid content and identity as well as monitoring the stability of LNP formulations. With optimization of the mobile phase pH other amine-containing lipids can be controlled to elute in-between cholesterol and DSPC and main reasonable run times. We think this method will be a beneficial contribution to the growing interest LNP technologies -not only in vaccines, but also therapeutics and there drug candidates utilizing this technology. \n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to Dr Adam Socia and Dr Ping Zhuang for providing critical review to the manuscript.

            "text": "Single-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a highly promising biotherapeutic agent for disease treatment and prevention [1,2]. Unlike protein-based therapeutics, mRNA-based therapies deliver transcripts used by host cell machinery to produce immunogenic or functional proteins of interest [3]. Typically, mRNA transcripts are larger transcripts (>2000 b), requiring encapsulation by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that protect against the environment and improve cellular uptake [4]. This mRNAbased approach has significant advantages, including the delivery of complex or low-yielding proteins [5] and facile adaptation to any target in emergency responses. The swift large-scale development of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has also prompted significant discussion on assessing mRNA modalities as platform technologies instead of individual products characterized by manufacturing process and disease target [6]. Given the expected following of this novel modality, correctly identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) and reaching a consensus on the means to assess them is an area of interest for both manufacturers and quality assessors. \n\nThe early identification of CQAs in biological products is critical for maintaining safety and efficacy in a product lifecycle. However, given the complex mode of action for mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics, directly evaluating efficacy or potency can be difficult [7]. As a result, physicochemical properties related to potency-determining attributes need to be extensively characterized [8]. One such CQA is transcript length or integrity, because critical elements at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are required for efficient protein synthesis [9] and the manufacturing process necessarily results in a mixture of fragments [10]. RNA is also susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage from both spontaneous and RNAse-induced degradation. Encapsulation offers some protection, but fragmentation remains a critical concern for long-term stability [11]. Thus, as a stability-indicating CQA, it is critical that the mRNA length profile is accurately assessed over time.",

After sterile filtration, bulk formulation is aseptically filled into glass vials, and stored frozen at \u2212 70 \u2022 C. Characterization of final formulation includes particle size and polydispersity (PDI) measurement by dynamic light scattering (ZEN3600, Malvern Instrument, Malvern, United Kingdom), RNA encapsulation and quantification by a fluorometric assay using Ribogreen RNA reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and mRNA purity characterization by capillary electrophoresis using fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical, USA). Briefly, mRNA was analyzed for size and integrity using a parallel capillary electrophoresis instrument Fragment Analyzer 5400. Each prepared sample is voltage injected into discrete capillaries, arranged in a parallel format. The capillaries contain a separation gel matrix infused with a fluorescent intercalating dye, that is automatically primed into the capillaries prior to each run. During electrophoresis, the nucleic acid fragments in the sample migrate and separate based upon their size, picking up dye along the way. As the separated fragments pass by the detection window, the nucleic acid bound dye is excited by a continuous light source, producing fluorescent emission which is detected by a sensitive CCD detector. The time required to pass through the detection window indicates size and the relative emission signal provides the nucleic acid concentration when compared to a calibrated ladder. ProSize analytical software automatically provides information on mRNA integrity and size distribution. In addition, to more accurately determine purity (integrity) of mRNA the data is transferred to internal Excel sheets (Purity Calculator) designed to perform mRNA peak integration according to principles used by chromatographic integration software. All mRNA samples with initial concentration above 50 \u00b5g/mL are diluted to 50 \u00b5g/mL of mRNA with RNAse-free water in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL or greater and then used for preparation of analytical samples in the 96-wells plates.",

            "text": "It has been shown that increased delivery effectiveness of cationic lipids is linked to increased toxicity (Tenchov et al. 2021). To minimize those toxic effects, efforts are made to develop efficient models of biodegradable LNPs. The toxicity and immunogenicity of free mRNA mandates a rigorous characterization of the final product regarding mRNA loading ratio and the absence of free mRNA. \n\nAnalytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) is exquisitely suited to fulfill this role as the rotor speed can be freely adjusted to cover a size range from 1 kDa peptides up to GDa protein complexes (or some 100 nm, respectively). The advent of new instrumentation and detection systems fostered the development multiwavelength experiments (Gorbet et al. 2015;Walter et al. 2015;Horne et al. 2020;Henrickson et al. 2021Henrickson et al. , 2022;;Maruno et al. 2021Maruno et al. , 2022;;McIntosh et al. 2021;Hayes and Dobnik 2022)which have proven their great potential for the analysis of gene therapy products. \n\nLNPs are inherently heterogeneous and complex products but also offer an additional dimension of separation by AUC. Delivery system (lipids) and cargo (RNA) have vastly different densities which influence their sedimentation behavior. This can be further exploited by density variation experiments in the presence of different D 2 O or other water isotope concentrations. This method has been recently developed by Henrickson et al. (Henrickson et al. 2021) and was used to investigate the loading ratio of different siRNA formulations. \n\nHere, we demonstrate how such a density distribution can be deconvoluted into the fraction of lipid and mRNA, and subsequently, the number of mRNA copies per capsid be calculated.",

            "text": "As the integrity and purity of the mRNA are essential to safeguard efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines, it is important to have tools to monitor these aspects. There are various attributes of the mRNA molecules that collectively determine whether the product can be used. The review by Poveda et al. highlights these attributes and briefly touches upon approaches that are used in general to measure and monitor them (Poveda et al., 2019). Table 3 provides a comprehensive list of analytical methods to determine and monitor quality attributes and stability of mRNA vaccine bulk drug substance and final drug product. Quality specifications for the presently accepted mRNA-LNP COVID-19 products are still not available in the public domain. Leaked documents (through a cyberattack of the EMA, just before the approval date in the UK and the USA), which contain classified information on the quality of Comirnaty, mention percentages of mRNA integrity between 70 and 75% (Tinari, 2021) and the assessment report from the EMA reads: 'the quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the emergency context of the current (COVID-19) pandemic, is considered to be sufficiently consistent and acceptable.'\n\nHere we elaborate on the techniques that are applicable for studying the integrity of mRNA and used for quality control (QC). An overview of quality documentation required by EU authorities for an Investigational Medicinal Products Dossier (IMPD) with a focus on mRNA vaccines is given by Schmidt and the interested reader is referred to that informative document for details (Schmid, 2017). Because many of the described methods are intended for assaying naked mRNA, whereas mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are encapsulated in LNPs, for some assays the mRNA first needs to be released and isolated from the LNP. Potential effects of this isolation process can be taken into account by including proper controls.\n\nGel electrophoresis is a frequently used technique that can give information on the size and the integrity of the mRNA. When mRNA degrades and strand breaks occur, the mRNA strand becomes shorter. As a result, the intensity of the band at the expected mRNA length will decrease or the band will broaden, while new bands may appear. Using this approach D\u00e9moulins et al. analyzed the quality of SAM under RNase free conditions (D\u00e9moulins et al., 2017",

            "text": "mRNA protection analyses were conducted to determine the storage conditions under which various LNPs could effectively protect mRNA from RNase A. The encapsulation of mRNA by the LNPs was verified using a gel retardation assay (Figure 3a). In the absence of RNase A treatment, mRNA was detected in the LNPs. However, the ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs displayed smeared bands, indicating suboptimal mRNA binding. In contrast, no mRNA was released from the DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs. Upon RNase A treatment, mRNA was not detected in the ALC-0315 and SM-102 LNPs, suggesting inadequate protection, whereas DMKD and DMKD-PS LNPs showed robust mRNA binding. The primary aim of this gel retardation assay is to evaluate the strength of the binding between LNPs and mRNA, particularly their ability to retain mRNA without external release. In the assay, LNPs that are strongly bound to mRNA do not move through the agarose gel pores, remaining in the well. While LNPs with ALC-0315 and SM-102 partially retained mRNA in the well, most were unable to capture nucleic acids effectively and migrated through the gel. In contrast, DMKD-based LNPs exhibited a strong affinity for nucleic acids, mostly remaining in the well. When exposed to RNase A, only the DMKD-based LNPs retained nucleic acids, indicating superior protection of mRNA from RNase and a strong, lasting bond that prevents mRNA release into the external environment. \n\nFurthermore, the structural integrity of mRNA with DMKD-PS LNPs at 4C was assessed using a gel retardation assay (Figure 3b). Remarkably, the DMKD-PS LNPs maintained mRNA complexation even after 16 weeks. Disruption of DMKD-LNPs using Triton X-100 resulted in smeared bands, indicating that the mRNA was securely entrapped within the particles, which maintained its structural integrity under storage conditions.",

This was achieved by adding 175 \u00b5L of LNP formulations containing 100 ng/mL RNA to 350 \u00b5L of 2,000-fold diluted RiboGreen reagent, and 175 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 TE buffer (Tris-EDTA), the dilutions were made in a 1.5 mL RNase-free Eppendorf tube. The contents were mixed well. The RNA standard curve samples and the LNP dilutions (in triplicate) were added to a black, flat-bottom 96-well plate, with a final volume of 200 \u03bcL per well. The plate was mixed well and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature, protected from light.

            "text": "Novel vaccine platforms for delivery of nucleic acids based on viral and non-viral vectors, such as recombinant adeno associated viruses (rAAV) and lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), hold great promise. However, they pose significant manufacturing and analytical challenges due to their intrinsic structural complexity. During product development and process control, their design, characterization, and quality control require the combination of fit-for-purpose complementary analytical tools. Moreover, an in-depth methodological expertise and holistic approach to data analysis are required for robust measurements and to enable an adequate interpretation of experimental findings. Here the combination of complementary label-free biophysical techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle-DLS (MADLS), Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), multiple detection SEC and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have been successfully used for the characterization of physical and chemical attributes of rAAV and LNPs encapsulating mRNA. Methods\u2019 performance, applicability, dynamic range of detection and method optimization are discussed for the measurements of multiple critical physical\u2212chemical quality attributes, including particle size distribution, aggregation propensity, polydispersity, particle concentration, particle structural properties and nucleic acid payload.",

            "text": "All RNA integrity evaluation strategies are based on generalized assumptions about a very diverse nucleic acid pool.For example, it's been shown that the degree of degradation varies among different transcripts, and a substantial fraction of the variation can be explained by functional and structural features of different transcripts 20 .Also, 5':3' assay based on PGK1 transcript might slightly overestimate the integrity of short transcripts as it is known that shorter transcripts degrade faster than longer ones 28 .Therefore, more research is needed to understand natural mRNA degradation process and how it affects different transcripts.\n\nNevertheless, one of the advantages of 5':3' assay is that it can be easily tailored by designing new qPCR primers for a specific transcript which is then taken as a representative of mRNA pool.Thus such transcript can be chosen to represent not all but a fraction of mRNAs with certain length, structure or function of interest.Such adaptation of 5':3' assay to reflect a certain group of similar transcripts could improve the accuracy of mRNA integrity evaluation even further.\n\nIn conclusion, the 5':3' assay is a promising method for assessing mRNA integrity for gene expression studies, offering advantages over conventional techniques.The assay, based on PGK1\n\nmRNA, provides a user-friendly assessment system, aligning the integrity score with the widely used RIN values.Its correction for primer amplification efficiency enhances analytical accuracy, addressing the variations in qPCR conditions.While validation against RIN values showed strong correlation in heat-degraded samples, a slight disparity of correlation in clinical samples emphasizes the likely impact of the differences in enzymatic degradation of mRNA and rRNA.\n\nDespite acknowledged limitations, the adaptability of the 5':3' assay by designing primers for specific transcripts holds high potential for personalized assessments, offering a step forward in refining the accuracy of mRNA integrity evaluations.\n\nACSF used for tissue transport was prepared as previously reported 29 .Shortly, the solution contained 0.

We conclude that exposure of mRNA to water likely is the main factor for mRNA vaccine instability. An implication of this is that decreasing the exposure to water would be a promising approach for improving mRNA vaccine stability.\n\nThe studies on mRNA-LNP structures indicate that the mRNA is located in the core of LNPs together with ionizable cationic lipid and water. This raises important questions about the possible shielding of the mRNA from water. It is, for example, unknown if and how the ionizable cationic lipids in the LNP interact with the mRNA. More work needs to be done to confirm the proposed structure and to understand the consequences. For instance, the pH inside the LNPs has been identified as an important characteristic to study in relation to stability. Another object of study would be to specifically analyze the type(s) of degradation that mRNA molecules undergo in their final formulation and whether sequence adjustment could help to maintain strand integrity. This could then also be coupled to characterization and optimization of the secondary and tertiary structure of mRNA, as there are indications that some folded structures are more stable.\n\nThis report is the first comprehensive survey of the factors behind mRNA-LNP vaccine instability. It also points towards solutions to address this instability and thereby may be of assistance to the development of more thermostable mRNA-LNP vaccines, alleviating a major barrier for the distribution of these vaccines.",

            "text": "important asset for mRNA vaccine development [38]. In our mouse immunization study using influenza HA expressing UNR from Trilink, the potency of DOG-IM4 LNPs remained essentially the same over one year of storage in PBS at 4 \u2022 C, based on their capacity  to induce high functional HI antibodies. This initial observation was confirmed in a temperature stress study using hEPO reporter mRNA to provide a rapid readout for in vivo bioactivity. The functional in vivo assay was accompanied by a set of biochemical and biophysical assays including mRNA integrity and encapsulation, particle sizing, and lipid integrity by HPLC-CAD-MS. The hEPO results confirmed that DOG-IM4 LNPs would be stable for at least one week at 25 \u2022 C and for at least 6 months at 4 \u2022 C. In this temperature stress study, the decline of potency of the LNPs over time could not be attributed to a degradation of the LNP lipid components as assessed by RP-HPLC-MS analysis but rather to a degradation of mRNA as assessed by fragment analyzer on a fraction of mRNA extracted from the LNPs. The mRNA degradation was accompanied with an evolution of LNP particle size from 130 nm to 150 nm, suggesting an evolution of the LNP structure. RNA degradation could occur through in-line hydrolytic cleavage and attack by nucleases, oxidizers, and chemical modifiers that may be present in the RNA's environment [63]. In-line hydrolytic cleavage refers to mRNA backbone cleavage by inline attack of ribose 2 \u2032 OH on the neighboring phosphodiester bond. This transesterification reaction, which may be catalyzed by amino lipids able to decrease the pKa of 2 \u2032 OH, relies on the RNA backbone being able to adopt a specific conformation where the 2 \u2032 OH is in line with the leaving 5 \u2032 oxyanion of the phosphodiester [64]. DOG-IM4 was designed with an imidazole group attached to a flexible spacer arm as to enable \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 interactions within the LNPs, not only between neighboring imidazole head groups but also with nitrogenous base rings on mRNA on top of the electrostatic interactions with the mRNA phosphate backbone.

Standard curves were generated within the range between 0.0 to 2.0 \u03bcg mRNA/mL using a series of free mRNA solutions with or without 1% v/v Triton X-100. The concentrations of free mRNA and total mRNA in the formulation were determined using bulk fluorescent reading (excitation: 490 nm, emission: 535 nm) of the sample against the corresponding standard curves. The amount of RNA loaded into the LNPs (internal RNA) was calculated by subtracting the values obtained in 1 x TE (external RNA) from 1 x TE + 1% Triton X-100 (total RNA). Subsequently, the encapsulation efficiency was calculated as the percentage obtained by dividing the amount of internal RNA by the total RNA amount. \n\nLNP Apparent pKa: A series of buffers with pH values varying by 1 between 3.0 and 12.0 were prepared by titrating a solution containing 10 mM citrate, 10 mM phosphate, 10 mM borate, and 150 mM NaCl with 1.0 M HCl and 0.5 M NaOH. LNPs were diluted to 75 \u03bcM ionizable lipid, TNS to 6 \u03bcM in these buffers. Fluorescence intensity was determined using a Thermo Scientific 3020 spectrophotometer (325 nm excitation/435 nm emission). With the resulting fluorescence values, a sigmoidal plot of fluorescence versus buffer pH was created. The log of the inflection point of this curve was the apparent pKa of the LNP formulation.",

            "text": "The storage stability of the mRNA-LNPs is an important issue. For mRNA-LNPs to remain functional after storage, the chemical degradation of mRNA and lipids, as well as the physical degradation of LNPs, must be prevented. Chemical degradation can result in mRNAs losing their activity due to hydrolysis, [38] oxidation, and transesterification. [39][40][41] Furthermore lipids can undergo hydrolysis or oxidation.\n\nTo prevent physical degradation, it is recognized that heating and repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided, but the impacts of lipid chemical structures on LNP stability are poorly understood. As microviscosity is related to energy that inhibits the lipids attempting to diffuse freely within LNPs, we have speculated that microviscosity will affect the physical stability of LNPs as well as their physicochemical properties immediately after preparation.\n\nTo investigate these relationships, LNPs were stored at various temperatures (4, 25, or 40\u00b0C) and their physicochemical characteristics were assessed for up to 90 d (Table S3, Supporting Information). As expected, less viscous LNPs such as CL4F 15-1 and CL4F 14-2 gradually increased in particle size and polydispersity and over time, leaked mRNA. To better clarify the impacts of microviscosity on stability, microviscosity was plotted against physicochemical properties after 1 month of storage at 40\u00b0C (Figure 3j-l). The results showed that LNPs with microviscosity below %150 mPa s have poor storage stability. These data suggest that the lipid tail structure determines the properties of LNPs, and thus influences their physical stability.",

Residual DNA contamination in mRNA therapeutic products results from the incomplete removal of plasmid DNA following, typically, DNase I digestion, LiCl precipitation, chromatographic purification, and/or tangential flow filtration steps. 15 Product-related impurity detection for dsDNA is a critical quality attribute for mRNA active substance 15 and is commonly assessed using ELISA, whereas process-related residual DNA template impurities are detected by qPCR techniques. Thymine has been shown previously 11 to be liberated from DNA following similar acid hydrolysis approaches, as described above. Supplemental Figure 7 is provided to demonstrate thymine impurity detection in hydrolyzed samples of unencapsulated mRNA and in LNPencapsulated products. Thymine can act as a surrogate for deoxyribonucleotides and distinguishes residual DNA from the mRNA therapeutic product. \n\nThird, residual protein impurities can be assessed contemporaneously through the detection of amino acids, which act as proxies for proteins following acid hydrolysis. Residual protein impurity is commonly suggested as a critical quality attribute for active substance impurity release testing. 5,16 mino acids are detectable using the identical acid hydrolysis sample preparation and LC separation as those used for nucleobases, and they are resolved from nucleobases and NTPs chromatographically. Figure 3 provides extracted ion chromatograms for commonly measured amino acids (those commonly accepted as stable during hydrolysis in AAA studies 17 ), detected here in a hydrolyzed LNP-mRNA (luciferase) commercial product. Five amino acids ideal for quantification were monitored by MRM (Ile, Leu, Phe, Pro, and Val) and were detectable above the LOQ. Absolute quantitation of protein contamination in mRNA therapeutics requires knowledge of the makeup and ratio of all residual proteoforms within the mixture, which is unknown for these products, and use of optimized hydrolysis conditions for each proteoform.",

Multi-detector field flow fractionation (MD-FFF, AF2000 Multiflow FFF (Postnova Analytics, Landsberg am Lech, Germany)) was used, equipped with a multi-angle light-scattering detector (MALS, PN3621) and a UV-Vis absorbance detector (PN3211).

Despite the recent success of mRNA-based therapies and vaccine development and approval, the analytical characterization of IVT mRNA remains a major challenge. \n\nSeveral analytical methods are commonly used for mRNA characterization and are employed in quality control (QC) environments to support batch release and stability and assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) at different stages of the drug life cycle, including production and storage. 8,9 Purity is usually assessed by ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC) by measuring product-related impurities, such as short mRNA fragments, 10\u221214 while integrity is usually confirmed by determining mRNA length by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE). 15,16 As an alternative, Raffaele et al. demonstrated the value of using on-chip capillary electrophoresis to determine the purity and integrity of 2000nucleotide (nt) mRNA in lipid nanoparticle vaccines. 17 ecently, considerable efforts have been made to improve the separation, sensitivity, applicability, and turnaround times of the HPLC-based methods. For example, the choice of the IP-RPLC column, the composition of the mobile phase using an ion-pairing agent, and the column temperature have been studied for short 100-nt RNAs. 10,18 Regarding the analysis of long mRNAs, Kuwayama et al. reported the interest in using an octadecyl-based RPLC column with superwide pores for achieving higher separation. 19 Similarly, an ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column has been recently introduced for efficient separation of mRNA aggregates and lipid nanoparticles. 20 Additionally, mass photometry (MP) was recently introduced as an interferometric mass spectrometry (MS) methodology capable of measuring the mass and relative abundance of biomolecules in solutions. 21 However, further studies are needed to understand the extent to which MP's capabilities apply to nucleic acids 22 and in particular to mRNA characterization.",

We have determined a discrete distribution ranging from 1 to 10 mRNA copies with an average of 5 copies per particle for our LNP formulation. However, potential users should keep two limitations in mind. First, this assay cannot distinguish between full length and degraded mRNA and thus confirm the integrity of the encapsulated nucleic acid. An LNP with 5 mRNA copies will have the same density as a particle with 10 half copies. This must be monitored by other assays such as (capillary) gel electrophoresis during drug substance/drug product characterization. Second, the data analysis assumes that the density and the ionic strength of the solvent inside the particle is the same as that of the bulk solvent. This may not be critical for dilute buffers like PBS but may become an issue in formulations containing high concentrations of excipients, especially salt as it may alter the vbar of the nucleic acid. A special attention should also be paid to the preparation of the D 2 O containing buffer (D 2 O is hygroscopic) as the low density of empty and full particles requires only a few percent of D 2 O to match the density.",

            "text": ", the mRNA strand becomes shorter. As a result, the intensity of the band at the expected mRNA length will decrease or the band will broaden, while new bands may appear. Using this approach D\u00e9moulins et al. analyzed the quality of SAM under RNase free conditions (D\u00e9moulins et al., 2017). Based on the gel electrophoresis data, they were able to determine whether the mRNA is of acceptable quality and stable. Commercial electrophoresis equipment is now available for high-throughput analysis of mRNA (Pocernich et al., 2019).\n\nRecently, Zhang et al. showed that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can be used to monitor changes in mRNA size (H. Zhang et al., 2020). The Brownian motion of fluorescent mRNA gives an indication of its molecular weight. This technique, however, needs a fluorescent label, is not more accurate than gel electrophoresis and only detects mRNA degradation involving substantial changes in molecular weight, e.g., strand breaks.\n\nThroughout the (bio)pharmaceutical industry chromatographic techniques form a powerful platform to monitor purity and stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug products. However, the development of HPLC techniques for establishing purity and stability of mRNA molecules has been slow so far. Successful protocols for analyzing large mRNA molecules can be found in the patent literature as well as in publications where RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC, IP-HPLC and IEX-HPLC methods are described (Issa and Packer, 2019;Kanavarioti, 2019;Spivak et al., 2014). Some of these techniques can also be used for mRNA purification purposes (Kim et al., 2007;Levine et al., 2019). IEX-HPLC can be used for measuring free and LNP encapsulated mRNA. An orthogonal technique to establish the same parameter is the earlier mentioned Ribo-Green technique. Different outcomes, however, were found for the same mRNA-LNP product; the IEX-HPLC outcome correlated better with the in vivo readout than the RiboGreen data. This illustrates that even established techniques like the RiboGReen assay should be carefully validated on a case-by-case basis (Schariter et al., 2019). mRNA degradation can also",

            "text": "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area. Particle size does not seem to have a strong effect on peak area with this method. Both methods, particularly method A, allow one to characterize LNP stability investigating different storage times and FTCs, and to distinguish between different preparations, including changing lipid compositions and batch-to-batch variability. The developed methods are very sensitive in showing even the smallest changes in the samples, as evident from the measurements of the samples after 1 week of storage in the refrigerator. In addition, empty and loaded LNPs can be clearly differentiated. Therefore, the presented methods offer several advancements compared to previously established physicochemical methods. These results are consistent with the established models for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [2,46]. Most of the mRNA resides in the center of the LNPs, interacting with the cationic lipid of opposite charge. More detailed information is",

            "text": "In addition to impurities formed during synthesis, degradation products formed during manufacturing and storage (of the DS and the DP) need to be assessed. While impurities coming from the DS production process (the IVT reaction) will not likely increase over time, impurities formed by degradation are likely to increase over time. \u221260 Shorter RNA fragments are the most probable mRNA degradation product formed by hydrolysis of the 3'-5'-phosphate diester bond in the backbone, resulting in cleavage of the chain. 61 The kinetics of the transesterification reaction are accelerated by alkaline pH and thermal stress. Thus, around pH 7 and through storage in a freezer (-20\u00b0C or -70\u00b0C), the mRNA degradation by chain breakage will be minimized. The formation of cap-less and tailless mRNA follows the same chemical degradation pattern as for the formation of any other fragment throughout the mRNA chain. Strand breakage can also be caused by other mechanisms including oxidation (in presence of peroxides or by auto-oxidation 62 ) or by enzymatic degradation (RNases). To mitigate such mRNA degradation and prevent cleavage by RNases, a drug delivery system to encapsulate the mRNA is almost always needed. There is evidence that 'naked mRNA' intradermally injected in human patients leads to translation and in the case of a intranodally injected vaccine, to the desired immune response. 63,64 But nowadays, almost all mRNA trials use a delivery system to protect the mRNA cargo in vivo and facilitate uptake in the target cells following more practical injection routes. Currently, the most commonly used delivery system is a lipid nanoparticle (LNPs). However, the lipids Table 3 Critical Quality Attributes and methods of their assessment for mRNA-LNP Drug Product as outlined in draft USP guidance 49 and Daniel et al. 42  used to prepare LNPs can be a source of reactive impurities such as peroxides and aldehydes, that could also degrade the mRNA. 65 wo other chemical degradation pathways include depurination and deamination (Table 4; Fig. 4). Depurinated or abasic sites of the mRNA are degradation products where the backbone and sugar are intact, but the base is lost.",

            "text": "mRNA is constructed from four canonical ribonucleosides (rA, rC, rG, and rU) or from chemically modified and isomerized ribonucleosides. The integrity of mRNA is evaluated by analyzing it in its intact form as previously mentioned. Such an analysis, however, cannot reveal where modifications exist and where specific adducts might have formed during storage with the lipid molecules of the LNP [44]. Such characterization requires two types of analysis. In one case, mRNA can be completely hydrolyzed into its individual building blocks and the resulting residues can be analyzed by LC-MS to reveal the extent to which chemical modifications and adducts are present in the molecule [45]. Location specific information is lost in such an analysis. To determine where things are occurring in an mRNA sequence, a different type of approach called 'oligo mapping' is required. In this approach, an mRNA molecule is partially hydrolyzed into digestion products, and the obtained sample is then separated by either IP-RP or HILIC chromatography and analyzed with tandem mass spectrometry. Fragment masses and their sequences can thereby be determined. In this way, the sequence of an mRNA can be confirmed and modifications can be detected and tracked with residue specific sequence resolution. This capability is different than what is possible with other assays. For instance, new next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform technologies may also allow direct RNA sequencing [46]. MS reveals such information through mass shifts, and sequence context can be derived from gas phase fragmentation and analysis of fragment ions derived from backbone dissociation. In practice, tandem mass spectrometry and gas phase fragmentation techniques are most effectively applied to oligonucleotides species < 100 nt in size [47,48]. Therefore, intact mRNA is cleaved into smaller pieces by either enzymatic or non-enzymatic methods. Nonenzymatic methods include alkaline [49] or acid [50] hydrolysis. \n\nBy their nature, these non-enzymatic techniques lack specificity and do not yield predictable, consistent reaction products. Nucleobasespecific or sequence-specific ribonucleases, on the other hand, cleave RNA in a predictable fashion.",

Unlike siRNA, mRNA molecules are larger, single stranded and more susceptible to nuclease degradation. The payload versatility of our formulation approach was assessed by utilizing FLuc mRNA as the model payload. A similar stepwise increasing concentration of DOTMA to replace ionizable lipid in the LNP formulation was explored (Table 2). Physicochemical properties indicated an increase in charge with the increase in relative DOTMA concentration (Fig. 2a). 20% DOTMA containing LNPs showed the highest encapsulation efficiency with downward trend at higher concentrations, though all formulations exhibited around 70% mRNA encapsulation (Fig. 2a). The addition of DOTMA also translated to effective protein expression in vitro, with performance trend similar to that observed for siRNA DOTMA LNPs (Fig. 2b and c). Interestingly, mRNA-LNP formulations caused loss in viability in RAW 264.7 cells while still showing mRNA expression. We observed that with increasing concentration of permanently charged lipid from 0-30%, the cell viability declines but improves at higher DOTMA concentrations. We also noticed that the expression remains almost the same despite the loss in viability. This observation is specific to RAW 264.7 cells, Caco-2 cells dosed with the same mRNA-LNP formulation do not show any loss of viability. A recent publication observed that C12-200 containing LNPs with fLuc mRNA was amongst the highest expressing formulation and demonstrated higher inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells [26]. The observed inflammation was linked to endosomal damage, crucial for endosomal escape and, subsequently, for effective mRNA expression. In an inflamed state, macrophages often adopt an M1 phenotype, potentially leading to increased uptake of LNPs [27]. The decreased viability in RAW 264.7 cells could be attributed to phenotype-associated excessive phagocytosis, lipid accumulation and subsequent cationic lipid-dependent toxicity.",

            "text": "Preservation of the integrity of macromolecular higher-order structure is a tenet central to achieving biologic drug and vaccine product stability toward manufacturing, distribution, storage, handling, and administration. Given that mRNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) are held together by an intricate ensemble of weak forces, there are some intriguing parallels to biologic drugs, at least at first glance. However, mRNA vaccines are not without unique formulation and stabilization challenges derived from the instability of unmodified mRNA and its limited history as a drug or vaccine. Since certain learning gained from biologic drug development may be applicable for the improvement of mRNA vaccines, we present a perspective on parallels and contrasts between the emerging role of higher-order structure pertaining to mRNA-LNPs compared to pharmaceutical proteins. In a recent publication, the location of mRNA encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles was identified, revealing new insights into the LNP structure, nanoheterogeneity, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA molecules [Brader et al. Biophys. J.2021, 120, 276633773963]. We extend those findings by considering the effect of encapsulation on mRNA thermal unfolding with the observation that encapsulation in LNPs increases mRNA unfolding temperatures.",

            "text": "settings and inform the continued development of improved mRNA-LNP based medicines.\n\nAs studies into LNP formulations continue, emerging evidence suggests that LNPs have the potential for organ-and tissue-specific tropism of mRNA-based medicines (Rostami et al., 2014;Veiga et al., 2020;Tomb acz et al., 2021). The tissue-specific distribution could potentially be facilitated by multiple factors, including LNP particle size, lipid components, and incorporation of specific targeting proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies on the LNP surface (Veiga et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2021;Di et al., 2022). Although these properties of LNPs are enticing for future drug development, reports have identified variability in delivery of these constructs with greater inflammatory responses associated with the use of xenobiotic lipids which is not apparent with naturallyoccurring LNP components (Ndeupen et al., 2021). As naturally occurring LNP components (e.g., lipids, cholesterol, cholesterol esters) undergo in vivo processing similar to that of endogenous analogs and xenobiotic lipid clearance routes are typically unknown (Scioli Montoto et al., 2020), a thorough assessment of safety and reactogenicity after LNP administration is needed. It is thus crucial that studies focus on both the primary biodistribution of the intact mRNA-LNP as well as the redistribution of its constituents and metabolites to evaluate the immunogenic potential of the intact mRNA-LNP formulation, its constituents, and their metabolites.\n\nStudies investigating mRNA-LNP biodistribution have traditionally used methods such as intracellular enzymatic reporters to track the delivery of intact encapsulated mRNA into host cells (Hassett et al., 2019;Aldosari et al., 2021;Delehedde et al., 2021;Yang et al., 2021). Such methods provide information on the biodistribution of intact mRNA-LNPs, but because the reporting capacity of these techniques is dependent solely on the viability and successful delivery of the intact mRNA, this method has limited use in determining the in vivo fates of constituents, metabolites, or of damaged mRNA-",

The formulation was diafiltrated with 10\u00d7 volume of PBS through a tangential flow filtration membrane (100 kD), and filtrated using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. The final mRNA-LNP formulations (termed as mRNA-mab22-LNP, mRNA-mab283-LNP, mRNA-mab26-LNP and mRNA-mab301-LNP) were stored at 2-8 \u00b0C until use, and the particle size and distribution were measured using dynamic light-scattering assay as described previously. 48 he mRNA antibody cocktail candidates Mix2a and Mix2b were developed by mixing mRNA-mab22-LNP and mRNA-mab26-LNP, mRNA-mab283-LNP and mRNA-mab26-LNP, respectively. Empty LNPs were utilized as the placebo. \n\nAnimal injection experiments Six-to eight-week-old specific pathogen-free female BALB/c mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd.",

            "text": "Naked mRNA is known to be very unstable due to various mechanisms such as heat, metal catalyzed acid-or basic based-hydrolysis, oxidation, as well as the existence of ubiquitous RNase enzyme. Although mRNA fragmentation might follow many pathways, the first-order kinetic of bond breaking is the major mechanism of its degradation. For example, metal ions catalyzed, alkaline condition, and high temperature activates and accelerates the 2'OH in ribose to attack the neighboring phosphate group to cleave the RNA [22]. It is expected that mRNA-based vaccine products encapsulated by LNPs would give better stability protection than naked mRNA. Here, we performed a forced degradation study using heat stress at various temperatures (-20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, 45\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C) for up to 90 days. Figure 5A-C illustrates mRNA stability data from heat-stressed mRNA-LNP samples at different temperatures. An example set of electropherograms from mRNA-LNP samples at various temperatures (-70\u00b0C black trace, 37\u00b0C blue trace, 45\u00b0C red trace, and 60\u00b0C green trace) for 4 days is shown in Fig. 5A. As the temperature increased, we observed a decrease in % main peak and an increase of % fragments, which resulted in a decrease in % integrity, indicating that the mRNA encapsulated in LNPs was not stable at these higher temperatures after 4 days. The electropherograms of mRNA-LNP samples stored at -20\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C are not shown but were similar to that of the -70\u00b0C (black trace), indicating that mRNA inside LNPs was stable and minimal changes in the % integrity occurred after 4 days at these temperatures. The starting % purity at time zero -70\u00b0C of the mRNA-LNP product was \u223c80% as shown by Fig. 5B. The mRNA integrity decreased with increasing temperatures due to degradation to smaller fragments. The % integrity was 0% after just a few days for the 60\u00b0C sample, after \u223c20 days for the 45\u00b0C sample, \u223c30 days for the 37\u00b0C sample, and \u223c60 days for the 25\u00b0C sample.",

            "text": "However, absorbance-based methods can only measure total mRNA content and cannot provide information about integrity or distinguish the concentration of each unique mRNA in a multivalent mixture. The two most common analytical techniques for mRNA identity are sequencing (NGS, Sanger) and RT-PCR. While both sequencing and RT-PCR can confirm the identity of mRNA constructs in multivalent mixtures, an often lengthy extraction is required prior to the analysis of encapsulated mRNAs. Multivalent quantification can also be performed using RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR, but again, an extraction step is required for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs. \n\nA multiplexed nucleic acid microarray technology based on the VaxArray platform (InDevR, Inc., Boulder, CO) was developed to simplify mRNA vaccine quantification and identification during the manufacturing process [24]. A VaxArray microarray for mRNA detection comprises synthetic DNA oligonucleotides designed to specifically capture the mRNA(s) of interest. The captured mRNAs are subsequently labeled via a variety of detection label approaches, and the fluorescence signal of the bound and labeled mRNA is proportional to the concentration of mRNA in the sample. The platform provides rapid (<2 h) identification and quantification of the mRNA material and can quantify multivalent material at multiple stages of the bioprocess (both naked RNA and encapsulated RNA). Once a new mRNA sequence is designed, it only takes 4-6 weeks to update and validate the capture sequences on the microarray. \n\nIn our previous work [24], we demonstrated proof of concept for a VaxArray mRNA assay using model influenza HA and NA coding region constructs from the literature using commercially manufactured mRNA [25]. Here, we expand on this initial work by assessing the analytical performance metrics of a VaxArray mRNA assay on an actual quadrivalent mRNA vaccine formulation, namely, four unique, full-length Pfizer-designed mRNA constructs targeting four different proteins.",

We analysed a model cationic RNA-complexed LNP formulation via the process impact on formulation critical quality attributes, short-term refrigerated stability evaluation and frozen-storage stability using zetasizer dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. We also evaluated freeze-/thaw-induced stress on LNP formulation using high-resolution field-flow fractionation.

One is the 3 /5 assay, which exploits the proximity of the targeted sequence to the A-tail at the mRNA 3 -end [10]. Reverse transcribing the mRNA using oligo(T) primer most of the cDNA should contain the complement to the mRNA 3 -end, while only full length cDNAs reverse transcribed from intact mRNAs should harbor the complement to the mRNA 5 -end. Hence, by quantifying the presence of the 5 -end and 3 -end sequences of an mRNA using oligo(T) primed RT-qPCR, the ratio should indicate the fraction of full lengths mRNA and, hence, reflect mRNA integrity. Although the 3 /5 assay has been reported to work well in some model systems [10,11] it has not been particularly useful for biological samples. One complication is that degraded samples contain DNA and RNA fragments that may prime the reverse transcription and the required specific oligo(T) priming is lost [12].\n\nA more recent molecular method employs amplicon length to assess mRNA integrity. It is based on using paired qPCR assays that produce amplicons of different length from the same target [13,14]. For intact mRNA, using probe based assays, the Cqs of the short and long amplicons should be virtually the same (for SYBR based assays Cqs depend on amplicon lengths, which has to be considered), while for fragmented RNA the Cq of the longer amplicon is higher than that of the shorter due to a lower yield [15].\n\nIn this work we evaluate the approach of measuring differential amplicons, Amp = Cq Amplicon1 -Cq Amplicon2 , and the amplicon ratio amplicon1/amplicon2 = 2 Amp (assuming 100% PCR efficiency and same fluorescence intensity per amplicon) as indicator of RNA integrity.

            "text": "LNP loading of mRNA requires complicated procedures, which hamper the widespread clinical application of the mRNA LNPs. In this study, we developed a simple, robust and versatile procedure for mRNA LNP preparation by mRNA PEGylation. Using this strategy, mRNA-loaded LNPs with regulated sizes and close-to-neutral surface charges were prepared just by mixing two aqueous solutions of parent LNP and mRNA without the need of buffer exchange for subsequent biological usage (Figures 3-6). Such easy procedure allows LNP preparation even at bedside, which additionally provides a solution to the issue of mRNA storage. Although lyophilization is an attractive approach for long-term storage of mRNA without degradation [27], lyophilization of mRNA-loaded LNPs could influence their physicochemical properties. On the other hand, lyophilization of mRNA molecule is an established technique, allowing long-term mRNA storage even at room temperature [28]. Our strategy would allow preparation of mRNA-loaded LNPs immediately after rehydration of lyophilized mRNA, minimizing time of mRNA storage in aqueous solution. \n\nFor mRNA PEGylation, 17 nt PEG-OligoRNAs were hybridized to mRNA. Importantly, addition of PEG-OligoA, an unhybridizing control, failed to prevent LNP aggregation (Figure 3c,d), demonstrating the importance of mRNA PEGylation through hybridization of PEG-OligoRNAs. Moreover, hybridization of 20 PEG-OligoRNAs per mRNA induced minimal influence on translational activity of mRNA (Figure 2). This result is consistent with our previous report of mRNAengineering, showing that short RNA oligonucleotides possessing functional moieties can be hybridized to mRNA with preserved translational activities [19]. Cellular mechanisms of unwinding dsRNA in an ATP-consuming manner presumably contributed to efficient translation from mRNA hybridized with short RNA oligonucleotides [29]. \n\nLNP PEGylation showed large influence on in vivo blood circulation profile after systemic injection (Figure 8). LNPs loaded with non-PEGylated mRNA formed aggregates immediately after the injection, leading to rapid clearance of the LNPs from the blood circulation.",

            "text": "We evaluated a new online method for determining the distribution of RNA content versus LNP-RNA size, enabling advanced LNP-RNA characterization. The method utilizes a standard SEC-MALS-UV-dRI system and is implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis module of ASTRA software. The calculated RNA wt % results from four LNPs, made with different types of PEG-lipids and compositional ratios, were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained by and fractionation with offline RPLC analysis. This work indicates that the correction of the scattering contribution to the UV signal implemented in the Nanoconjugate Analysis algorithm was adequate for reliable sizedependent RNA content analysis of lipid nanoparticles. Based on these results, we conclude that the online method is, in all likelihood, suitable for rapid and facile determination of the sized-dependent payload distribution of other LNPs encapsulating nucleic acids, or other carriers constructed from excipients that do not absorb UV at the characteristic absorption wavelength of the payload. The analytical advancement reported here provides additional characterization information, and potentially sheds light on understanding the therapeutic outcome of the RNA/DNA filled LNPs. We foresee the potential for use in quality control procedures, to evaluate the total RNA content in LNPs within a specified size range, which would constitute a critical quality attribute of a therapeutic LNP-RNA product.",

            "text": "ecause specific details of bulk and drug product production processes vary between manufacturers, and much of this information is currently kept confidential, the final criteria for regulatory approvals were left to be decided by each of the individual national regulatory authorities. For example, the criteria and acceptance ranges for specific manufacturing steps are not accessible in the public domain and companies often decline to respond in public to such inquires. 48 lthough the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has recently released a Draft Chapter on Analytical Procedures for mRNA Vaccine Quality with methods to support the testing of quality attributes for mRNAbased vaccines, the document does not include any acceptance criteria. In Table 2, analytical methods for assessment of various quality attributes of the bulk purified mRNA drug substance, as proposed by the USP guidance, are listed. 49 A similar summary is provided for the formulated mRNA drug product in Table 3. \n\nIn this USP guidance, Drug Substance (DS) refers to the active pharmaceutical ingredient that is tested before being formulated into the Drug Product (DP). The DP is the final dosage form as it will be stored, shipped and presented to the patient or healthcare professional. In this case, the DP consists of a lipid nanoparticle formulation containing four lipid excipients, encapsulating the mRNA, dispersed in a buffered medium suitable for freezing and for injection. Several tests related to mRNA purity that are performed on DS are repeated after formulation in the DP, because the formulation process can have an impact on the quality of mRNA as well. 27 Additional tests are related to LNP quality and purity of the lipid materials. The attributes in the last rows include standard compendial tests for parenteral products, for example, pH, osmolality, visual appearance and viscosity. The two different analytical packages and moments of assessment also reflect the fact that the DS and DP can be made in different facilities, which means that the DS will be shipped from one place to another and may be stored for an extended period of time. Re-testing of the DS therefore may also be required before it is formulated. 50,51 hile different methods serve different purposes in different stages of development, ultimately analytical development should lead to a specification suitable for batch release and for stability testing of both the DS and DP.",

            "text": "The relationship between the physical attributes and the potency of mRNA LNPs remains a huge interest in this field. A clear relationship can help the industry justify the specifications set for these assays and provide confidence for the regulatory agencies to provide more guidance. Moreover, potency, as a key indicator for the stability of vaccines, creates analytical challenges and burdens. The development process can be expedited with a more elucidated correlation between the potency and physiochemical characterizations of LNPs, which are easier to measure. \n\nThe LNP vaccines are intended to be used as frozen liquid and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C. For this short-term stability study, the conditions (\u221220 \u00b0C, 4 \u00b0C, 25 \u00b0C, 37 \u00b0C, and 45 \u00b0C) are considered elevated conditions. In the elevated conditions, the LNPs were supposed to have accelerated degradation. It is commonly acknowledged in the industry that mRNA integrity is a critical attribute to monitoring mRNA vaccines' functionality and stability [24,25]. Our data show that potency decreases with decreasing intact mRNA linearly until there is a sudden drop in potency at ~60% intact. The potency appears to decrease to 50% at 65% intact mRNA. Although more studies are needed in the future, we suspect it reaches a critical point in protein production at 65% mRNA integrity. LNPs stored at \u221220 \u00b0C and \u221270 \u00b0C show no loss in intact mRNA as expected since mRNA fragmentation involves a bond-breaking process; hence, in a frozen state, there is no/little bond breaking due to insufficient energy to reach the transition state. Despite stable, intact mRNA, the potency decreases for samples stored at \u221220 \u00b0C, suggesting another mechanism is involved, resulting in a decrease in potency other than intact mRNA. \n\nOne such proposed mechanism is based on particle size. The majority of the samples analyzed were in the size range of 95-125 nm, where any observed lower potency (<50%) is most likely due to the degraded intact mRNA size from those samples. However, as the LNP size increases beyond ~130 nm, the potency decreases to less than 50% (Figure 2B).",

            "text": "Two studies on real-life in-use stability of mRNA-LNP DP have been published. First, the stability of mRNA-LNPs during storage between being drawn into syringes and being injected was monitored. 92 The second study looked at the stability of left-over material in vials of Comirnaty. 91 Both publications concluded thatwithin the limits of the analytical techniques at their disposalonly mechanical shear stress caused immediate loss of mRNA integrity and aggregation of the LNP-mRNA complexes. This means that the mRNA-LNPs are stable when stored and handled as instructed, but this sensitivity to mechanical stress could have implications for transport as a liquid product. Another published example is the technical failure of a freezer in a hospital, which caused a temperature excursion to higher, but still subzero, temperatures for hours for SpikeVax \u00d2 . No detectable loss of mRNA integrity was observed in an electrophoretic assay. 144 In a following publication, the authors intentionally thawed and re-froze vials of Comirnaty \u00d2 and Spikevax \u00d2 and found that mRNA integrity (by electrophoresis) and immunogenicity in mice were preserved after 1 month of storage at -80\u00b0C and -20\u00b0C. 145 Re-freezing of reconstituted vials could in theory minimize waste, but it should be noted that this currently goes against manufacturer's instructions, since once the vial seal is punctured the sterility barrier has been broken. 106 Therefore, the product should be used within 12 hours (per label) and then discarded to prevent microbial contamination. Thus, reformulation of mRNA-LNPs products with antimicrobial preservatives to allow for more prolonged storage after opening the multidose vial (e.g., for up to 28 days) is a potential future option. To date, no systematic studies of mRNA-LNP products with antimicrobial preservatives have been published. Development of such multidose formulations will require ensuring the chemical and physical stability of the mRNA-LNP components as well as maintaining antimicrobial effectiveness during handling conditions.",

The z-average diameter (nm) and polydispersity index of LNPs were measured in a 96-well plate using a DynaPro plate reader II (Wyatt Technology UK Ltd., Wilmslow, UK). LNPs were diluted 10-fold in Tris buffer using a CyBio FeliX liquid handler (Analytik Jena UK Ltd., London, UK) for size measurement. Solvent parameters for sucrose 2% were applied for analysis, including a viscosity of 1.055 cP and refractive index of 1.336 (25 \u2022 C). \n\nThe payload encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was quantified using the Quanti-iT TM RiboGreen TM RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen TM ) following the manufacturer's instructions and adapted to be performed on a CyBio FeliX liquid handler (Analytik Jena), integrated with a PreciseFlex 750 robotic arm, STX44 incubator (LiCONiC, Montabaur, Germany), labware hotel, barcode reader, and Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). A high (0-1000 ng) standard curve was prepared using the encapsulated payload to quantify RNA from Triton-treated and non-Triton-treated wells. Briefly, samples were diluted to a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL mRNA and mixed with 50 \u00b5L of either 2% Triton-TE or 1\u00d7 TE buffer before incubation at 37 \u2022 C for 15 min. Following incubation, a 200\u00d7 RiboGreen solution was added to all wells for a final 1:1 dilution. Fluorescence was then measured at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 535 nm.",

            "text": "Rational design and robust formulation processes are critical for optimal delivery of mRNA by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Varying degrees of heterogeneity in mRNA-LNPs can affect their biophysical and functional properties. Given the profound complexity of mRNA-LNPs, it is critical to develop comprehensive and orthogonal analytical techniques for a better understanding of these formulations. To this end, we developed a robust ultracentrifugation method for density-based separation of subpopulations of mRNA-LNPs. Four LNP formulations encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) with varying functionalities were synthesized using two ionizable lipids, A and B, and two helper lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE), along with cholesterol and DMG-PEG-2K. Upon ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, a distinct pattern of \u201cfractions\u201d was observed across the gradient, from the less dense topmost fraction to the increasingly denser bottom fractions, which were harvested for comprehensive analyses. Parent LNPs, A-DOPE and B-DOPE, were resolved into three density-based fractions, each differing significantly in the hEPO expression following intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration. Parent B-DEPE LNPs resolved into two density-based fractions, with most of the payload and lipid content being attributed to the topmost fraction compared to the lower one, indicating some degree of heterogeneity, while parent A-DEPE LNPs showed remarkable homogeneity, as indicated by comparable in vivo potency, lipid numbers, and particle count among the three density-based fractions. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of density gradient-based ultracentrifugation (DGC) for a head-to-head comparison of heterogeneity as a function of biological performance and biophysical characteristics of parent mRNA-LNPs and their subpopulations.",

            "text": "The relationship between the physical attributes and the potency of mRNA LNPs remains a huge interest in this field. A clear relationship can help the industry justify the specifications set for these assays and provide confidence for the regulatory agencies to provide more guidance. Moreover, potency, as a key indicator for the stability of vaccines, creates analytical challenges and burdens. The development process can be expedited with a more elucidated correlation between the potency and physiochemical characterizations of LNPs, which are easier to measure. \n\nThe LNP vaccines are intended to be used as frozen liquid and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C. For this short-term stability study, the conditions (\u221220 \u2022 C, 4 \u2022 C, 25 \u2022 C, 37 \u2022 C, and 45 \u2022 C) are considered elevated conditions. In the elevated conditions, the LNPs were supposed to have accelerated degradation. It is commonly acknowledged in the industry that mRNA integrity is a critical attribute to monitoring mRNA vaccines' functionality and stability [24,25]. Our data show that potency decreases with decreasing intact mRNA linearly until there is a sudden drop in potency at ~60% intact. The potency appears to decrease to 50% at 65% intact mRNA. Although more studies are needed in the future, we suspect it reaches a critical point in protein production at 65% mRNA integrity. LNPs stored at \u221220 \u2022 C and \u221270 \u2022 C show no loss in intact mRNA as expected since mRNA fragmentation involves a bond-breaking process; hence, in a frozen state, there is no/little bond breaking due to insufficient energy to reach the transition state. Despite stable, intact mRNA, the potency decreases for samples stored at \u221220 \u2022 C, suggesting another mechanism is involved, resulting in a decrease in potency other than intact mRNA. \n\nOne such proposed mechanism is based on particle size. The majority of the samples analyzed were in the size range of 95-125 nm, where any observed lower potency (<50%) is most likely due to the degraded intact mRNA size from those samples. However, as the LNP size increases beyond ~130 nm, the potency decreases to less than 50% (Figure 2B).",

Measurement precision of this assay is shown to be less than 5% RSD for a combined agreement between nucleobases, independent sample preparations, and replicates, similar to other isotope dilution methods. No reference measurement procedures nor higher-order reference standards exist thus far for mRNA quantitation, impeding measurement comparability. Multiple factors, however, add confidence to the measurement accuracy (trueness) of this acid hydrolysis-ID-LC-MS assay and are identified as (1) agreement among nucleobases to act as independent surrogates of intact mRNA mass fraction, (2) samples and QC materials that are comparable with estimates from other analytical techniques (UV, RiboGreen), (3) evidence of complete mRNA hydrolysis and nucleobase stability, and (4) the use of well-characterized calibrators within a higher-order measurement system (isotope dilution). \n\nTable 5 provides a summary of the experimental results for mRNA quantification using the acid hydrolysis-ID-LC-MS approach, in contrast to spectroscopy estimates. The QC material used for this work was a 4521-nucleotide mRNA transcript with the mass concentration estimated using UV absorbance at approximately 1 mg/mL. The LC-MS approach agreed well (1000.9 \u03bcg/g \u00b1 28.1 \u03bcg/g) to the UV estimate from the manufacturer. Agreement to UV spectroscopy was anticipated for measurements of pure RNA, based on previous work 11 that measured the commercial, synthetic RNA (RNA Control 250, Ambion). The previous study also demonstrated the agreement of LC-MS with droplet digital PCR for estimating the quantity in matrix-based DNA materials (including a 7934 bp linearized DNA plasmid and whole genomic DNA prepared from buffy coat fractions). \n\nTable 5 also compares the quantitative results with RiboGreen assays following Triton extraction using two different LNP-encapsulated mRNA products. An evaluation of the results shows modest agreement for one example of LNP-mRNA material but poorer agreement (\u0394 = \u221220%) in another example.",

In detail, an N/P ratio of 5.6 was used for the following formulations (according to the construct size of 624 bases for Tc24 and 723 bases for ASP-2): (i) 300 \u03bcg of Tc24 mRNA, (ii) 300 \u03bcg of ASP-2 mRNA, or (iii) a combination of 150 \u03bcg of Tc24 and 150 \u03bcg of ASP-2 mRNAs. The following synthesis parameters were selected: the TFR was set at 9 mL/min, the FRR was 1:3 (organic: aqueous), and the initial and final waste was 100 \u03bcL. After synthesis, LNPs were dialyzed against 1\u00d7 PBS overnight and then filtered with 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filters to ensure sterility and remove potential aggregates. \n\nLNPs Characterization. Size (nm), PDI (au), and ZP (mV) were measured via DLS using Malvern Zetasizer for 28 days postsynthesis. Samples for size and PDI measurements were prepared by adding 10 \u03bcL of NPs and 990 \u03bcL 1\u00d7 PBS to a semimicrovolume disposable cuvette. In comparison, samples for ZP were prepared by adding 10 \u03bcL of sample to 90 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 PBS and 900 \u03bcL of double distilled water (ddH 2 O, salt concentration was lower to avoid damage to the electrodes of the ZP cuvette used for the measurement). For both size and ZP, three measures of 15 runs each were acquired and then averaged to obtain the final value for each formulation. \n\nmRNA encapsulation efficiency (EE %) was evaluated by using the Ribogreen RNA assay.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism for mRNA-based therapies present their own challenges in terms of characterization and analysis. Fundamentally, the lipid nanoparticle is comprised of four lipids (e.g., cationic/ionizable lipids, phospholipids, pegylated lipids, and cholesterol) at a specific ratio, each of which play a role in the stability, delivery, and efficacy of the nanoparticle. While elegant in design, similarities in the physicochemical properties of the lipids, as well as their relative abundance, require consideration when developing characterization and stability indicating methods. \n\nThe first analytical consideration to make in this regard is one about sample preparation. Ideas for sample preparation can be drawn from understanding how LNPs are formed. Ganesan and Narayanasamy have comprehensively reviewed a wide array of LNP preparation approaches [90]. Most commonly, two solutions are prepared for mixing -one is an ethanol solution of lipids and the other is an aqueous solution of mRNA. The aqueous solution is ratiometrically introduced to the ethanolic lipid solution using mixing techniques ranging from pipette aspiration to microfluidics. The assembly of the LNP can be reversed for the sake of compositional analysis. A preferred approach for this involves dissolving the particle by the addition of organic solvent. An RPLC analysis with either evaporative light scattering, charged aerosol, or mass spectrometric detection can thereafter be performed. Methanol is a commonly used organic solvent for liposome disruption where it can alter bilayer membrane structures and release the encapsulated drugs. Methanol and other organic solvents have proven to be equally effective at dissolving solid lipid nanoparticles. In fact, mixtures of chloroform and methanol and solutions containing methanol or isopropanol have also been used with success [91]. Li et al. prepared individual samples for siRNA and Fig. 8. Use of LC-MS to quantify a Cap-0 5'-end terminus species in the presence of its Cap-1 analog.",

            "text": "Traditionally, RNA integrity evaluation is based on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Nevertheless, gene expression studies are usually focused on protein coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). As rRNA and mRNA have significant structural and functional differences, the assumption that rRNA integrity properly represents mRNA integrity may not be accurate. Moreover, contrary to whole tissue RNA samples, subcellular preparations such as synaptosomes contain almost no rRNA, thus prohibiting the use of traditional rRNA-based methods to assess sample RNA integrity. Here we present a RT-qPCR based assay, which estimates mRNA integrity by comparing the abundance of 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 mRNA fragments in a long constitutively expressed mouse or human PGK1 mRNA. The assay was tested and validated using plasmids with cloned 3\u2019- and 5\u2019-ends of the PGK1 cDNA reflecting different ratios of 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 cDNA amplicons in partially degraded RNA samples. The accuracy of integrity score calculation was ensured by integrating a mathematical correction of qPCR results to account for the variable amplification efficiency of different primer pairs. The 5\u2019:3\u2019 assay was used to quantify RNA degradation in heat-degraded mouse and human brain tissue RNA as well as in clinical human brain RNA samples. Importantly, the expression of housekeeping genes correlated better with 5\u2019:3\u2019 integrity value than with the RIN. Finally, we were even able to use 5\u2032:3\u2032 assay to assess mRNA integrity in mouse synaptosomal preparations that lack rRNAs. We concluded that the 5\u2019:3\u2019 assay can be used as a reliable and sensitive method to evaluate mRNA integrity in mouse and human brain tissue and subcellular preparations.",

            "text": "Plasmid DNA (pDNA) plays an essential role in cell and gene therapy and can be delivered via different methods, including electroporation for ex vivo therapy or lipid nanoparticles for in vivo delivery. 1,2 Topological forms such as the open-circular impurities or multimers need to be characterized as they may affect the transfection efficiency. 3 Their separation is typically performed by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) and anion exchange chromatography (AEC). 4 Limitations in the AEC analysis of pDNA include adsorption issues more pronounced for the open-circular forms and limited resolution between the various topological forms. 5 Conversely, CGE suffers from poor reproducibility and challenges associated with the identification of unknown impurity peaks. \n\nMessenger RNAs (mRNAs) as pharmaceutical drugs have garnered significant interest since their successful use in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccines to keep the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under control and reduce the risks of lifethreatening events. 6 The accelerated approval of these vaccines by health authorities (HAs) have curbed the pandemic emergency. However, questions remain about the nature of LNP and mRNA impurities and their potential effects on efficacy and safety. Specifically, mRNA aggregates are not listed in the COVID-19 vaccine specifications and the justification of specifications is not readily available to the public. 7,8 Both the mRNA drug substance (DS) and LNP drug product (DP) may self-associate to form aggregates. The large sizes of mRNA and LNP and extreme differences in their respective physicochemical properties are major obstacles to their analytical characterization. \n\nThe determination of LNP size and polydispersity is conventionally performed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). 7,8 However, limitations exist with DLS, including the inability to differentiate bimodal size populations. 9 LNP structure and morphology are commonly visualized by imaging or scattering techniques such as cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 10 However, these techniques are not quantitative by nature, have limited throughput, or suffer from measurement challenges. 11",

            "text": "Interest in the use of LNPs as a drug delivery platform for gene delivery has seen an exponential increase over the past decade, with the regulatory approval of three LNP-based nanomedicine products: one therapeutic, and two vaccines for use in clinical settings. Since oligonucleotides encapsulated in LNPs can consist of a range of constituents, screening of prototype formulations during early development is crucial. As the range of academic and industrial applications of LNPs has seen tremendous growth, established techniques within the nanomedicine field have translated into adopted routine techniques for characterising the physicochemical attributes of LNP formulation candidates. Trend analysis of LNP research highlights that novel high-resolution analytical pipelines have not experienced an equivalent growth in their implementation in line with advancements in lipid research and they remain under-utilised for studying prototype formulations (figure 1). \n\nThe goal of this study was to apply high-resolution analytical techniques for profiling LNP nanomedicine physicochemical properties during early prototype development to facilitate clinical translation for therapeutic applications. In this work we use DOTAP-LNPs as a model LNP system, using PolyA as a model payload. We report the evaluation of process parameter manufacture and purification steps on LNP physical parameters, and an assessment of their physicochemical stability under refrigerated and ultra-low temperature storage (\u221280 \u2022 C) conditions using increasing-resolution orthogonal techniques. These advanced techniques provide deeper insights into LNP CQAs, enabling better control over CQAs and thereby advancing their translation. \n\nAnalysis of process parameter samples demonstrated that post-dialysis exchange of manufacturing buffer to formulation storage buffer resulted in unmasking of surface charges, increasing the LNP particle size distribution through sub-population formation and decreasing PolyA recovery (table S2). Our results highlight the importance of filter membrane selection. Both the PES and PVDF membranes that were selected were hydrophilic and low-binding: thus, ideally suited to biological aqueous formulated samples. The PVDF membrane contains electronegative fluoride groups, whereas PES contains sulfone moieties.",

LNPs encapsulating RNA (LNP-RNA) are formed through electrostatic capture and rapid precipitation by mixing of the payload and lipid packets comprised of cationic and neutral lipids. Various efforts have been made to study the physicochemical characteristic of the particles, such as size [14,15] and compositional heterogeneity [14], morphology [14,16,17], macromolecular structure [18] and RNA encapsulation efficiency [17,19]. Deep understanding of LNPs at the molecular level can help elucidate correlation of structure and in vitro/ in vivo performance, and develop effective manufacturing and control strategies. \n\nResearch has shown that the in vivo potency and tissue-penetrating ability of LNPs are related to particle size [20,21]. Through fractionation by semi-preparative SEC and subsequent offline size measurement of the fractionated samples by hydrodynamic light scattering (DLS), Zhang et al. studied the size dependence of LNP composition, RNA encapsulation and in vitro gene-silencing activities [15]. Their data showed correlation between the cationic polymer/RNA ratio and RNA gene-silencing potency, which highlighted the importance of size-based compositional assessment of the LNP-RNAs. \n\nAlthough semi-preparative fractionation by size with offline fraction analysis provides a viable approach to analysis of size-based compositional heterogeneity, the experiment is lengthy and laborious, and not suitable for use as a routine analytical procedure. Online analysis of the RNA payload versus size, in a single automated run, would be highly desirable.",

            "text": "Oligonucleotide mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and direct RNA sequencing provide detailed information on sequence and chemical modifications. These methods, while powerful, can be time consuming and require high levels of technical expertise and sophisticated instrumentation. \n\nQuality attributes such as capping efficiency and poly(A) tail length are commonly assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with either ultraviolet (UV) or mass spectrometry (MS) detection [8,9]. Proper capping is essential for efficient translation, and accurate measurement can be challenging due to the structural complexity of the mRNA cap. The poly(A) tail is a sequence of adenine nucleotides added to the end of an mRNA molecule, playing a crucial role in both RNA stability and translation efficiency by facilitating ribosome binding, and its length is often analyzed to understand gene expression regulation as longer tails generally correlate with increased mRNA stability and translation potential [10,11]. \n\nImpurities can arise at any step of the manufacturing process and must be carefully monitored to ensure the final product's purity and safety. In-process impurities such as dsRNA, residual DNA, nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), and solvents required different analytical assays [12][13][14][15]. Double-strand RNA can elicit strong immune responses and is typically detected using gel electrophoresis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [16,17]. Residual DNA from the production process is quantified using qPCR [18], while residual NTPs [19] and solvents [20] are measured by liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, respectively. Finally, it is also important to evaluate if the mRNA, after being transfected in specific in vitro models, can be efficiently translated into its corresponding full functional protein. \n\nIn vitro translation assays and Western blotting are employed to confirm the production Generally speaking, mRNA medicines must possess a sufficient level of purity, as underscored by documents leaked from the European Medicines Agency that expressed concerns over unexpectedly low quantities (>55%) of intact mRNA in batches of the vaccine developed for commercial production [7].",

One measurement for guanine was determined as an outlier using a standard z-score calculation (z > 3). The overall precision of the mRNA quantification is 3.9% RSD, with a mean mass fraction result of 38.83 \u03bcg/g \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcg/g. Figure 2 provides representative extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) data from LC-MS/MS (MRM) analysis of the acid hydrolyzed LNP-mRNA. \n\nA commercial, unencapsulated mRNA was used as QC for sample preparation and analytical measurement. Roughly 3 \u03bcg of the QC mRNA was measured in triplicate. QC samples were hydrolyzed concurrently with the LNP-mRNA samples and nucleobase calibrators. QC samples were prespiked using the identical internal standard mixture. Table 3 provides quantitative results for mRNA QC, having an estimated mass concentration of 1.0 mg/mL, as determined by the manufacturer using OD 260 absorbance measurements. The overall mean mRNA concentration was determined to be 1000.9 \u03bcg/g with a measurement precision (n = 18) of 2.8%  RSD among the three nucleobases quantified (A, C, G). Figure 1 provides the total ion mass chromatograms obtained from the analysis of the QC samples. In addition to the standard nucleobases for A, C, and G, the QC mRNA sample was transcribed in vitro using modified 5-methoxy UTP (5moUTP), and could be detected (but not quantified) by two MRM fragmentation transitions of 5-methoxy uracil (5moU) (Table 1). Hydrolysis Time-Course Analysis. Three sets of timecourse analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the acid hydrolysis ID-LC-MS/MS method. \n\nFirst, nucleobase stability was demonstrated under acid hydrolysis conditions (low pH, high temperature) to ensure calibrators are fit-for-purpose and to safeguard measurement accuracy.",

In Fig. 5A, when   an mRNA-containing LNP sample was stressed at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, the entire LNP profile shifts to lower apparent pI values and a new peak is detected (analogous to acidic variants in the context of protein analysis). Moreover, the \"acidic variants\" became more acidic with increasing temperature. At 60\u00b0C, the \"acidic variants\" were baseline separated from the main peak with a pI of 7.4 (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the higher the stress temperature, the greater the \"acidic variant.\" \n\nThe LNP stability experiment described above was repeated using LNPs that were formulated without mRNA. The corresponding electropherograms shown in Fig. 5B had a different degradation pattern compared to the LNPs containing mRNA. At 45\u00b0C after 24 h, the empty LNP peak showed a slight acidic shift of approximately 0.1 pI units. A sample stressed at 60\u00b0C for 24 h showed an uncharacteristic peak profile containing a sharp spike in absorbance, which may indicate LNP destabilization or aggregation. Unlike the mRNA-containing LNPs, these preparations did not show splitting into two peaks or generation of \"acidic variants.\" It is conceivable that the previously seen acidic peak could be due to the mRNA being exposed on the surface of the LNP. Future work employing LC ion exchange could be exploited to further investigate the behavior of these stressed samples.",

            "text": "engagement of the ribosomes with mRNAs requires preservation of the mRNA-ribosome interactions and for the mRNAs to be fully intact to migrate through the gradient at the correct speed. Degraded RNA can lead to an altered gradient profile and thus inaccurate determination of the translational landscape. For example, an intact mRNA bound by six elongating ribosomes would migrate through a sucrose gradient at a certain density; however, if this mRNA were cleaved by an endoribonuclease, resulting in two mRNA fragments each bound by fewer ribosomes, these would each migrate at a reduced density. Reagents such as RNAlater provide a means to retain RNA integrity immediately at the point of tissue harvesting. However, a key mechanism by which these reagents act involves denaturing the proteins, which renders any RNases present non-functional but also other proteins within the sample. Translational profiling methods require non-denaturing conditions to preserve the integrity of the ribosome. In this paper, we utilise a range of alternative methods to preserve the RNA integrity of mouse tissue samples and demonstrate how this varies across different tissues. We also demonstrate how these improved methodologies can then be utilised to interrogate the translatome accurately and consistently in mouse tissues.",

The lack of regulatory guidance on the specifications for mRNA LNPs is also partially due to this underexplored relationship. In this study, we performed a three-month stability study of heat-stressed mRNA LNP samples. The mRNA LNP samples were analyzed for their mRNA degradation, LNP particle sizes, and mRNA encapsulation efficiency. In vitro cell potency was also evaluated and correlated with these above-mentioned physiochemical characterizations. The mRNA degradation\u2013cell potency correlation data showed two distinct regions, indicating a critical cut-off size limit for mRNA degradation.

To ensure the integrity and purity of mRNA therapeutics, tools like the fragment bioanalyzer and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) are used to assess RNA lengths and size distribution. In parallel, ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RP LC) further aids in the separation of mRNA from impurities based on hydrophobic interactions, while size exclusion chromatography (SEC) can help in identifying aggregates based on size separation. \n\nFor identity, various molecular biology techniques are employed. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) -Sanger Sequencing is the conventional method used to confirm the open reading frame sequence. Oligonucleotide mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and direct RNA sequencing provide detailed information on sequence and chemical modifications. These methods, while powerful, can be time consuming and require high levels of technical expertise and sophisticated instrumentation. \n\nQuality attributes such as capping efficiency and poly(A) tail length are commonly assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with either ultraviolet (UV) or mass spectrometry (MS) detection [8,9]. Proper capping is essential for efficient translation, and accurate measurement can be challenging due to the structural complexity of the mRNA cap. The poly(A) tail is a sequence of adenine nucleotides added to the end of an mRNA molecule, playing a crucial role in both RNA stability and translation efficiency by facilitating ribosome binding, and its length is often analyzed to understand gene expression regulation as longer tails generally correlate with increased mRNA stability and translation potential [10,11]. \n\nImpurities can arise at any step of the manufacturing process and must be carefully monitored to ensure the final product's purity and safety.",

Also, reverse transcription can result in a loss of information about the existing base modifications on the mRNA template.

While all of these approaches may be fit for their specific purpose, currently, there is no way to compare between or to evaluate their accuracy. \n\nIt is proposed here that a careful consideration of mRNA quantity includes a link through an SI-traceable measurement approach in order to ensure calibration consistency, to reduce bias, and to account for measurement drift. No such SItraceable standard currently exists for nucleobases; however, the best available well-characterized materials are used in this work to provide a framework for establishing SI traceability, when higher-order standards do eventually become available. Previous work 11 demonstrated the use of acid hydrolysisisotope dilution-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS) to quantify pure or matrix-based oligonucleotides. Here, we expand on that technique to measure the mRNA cargo within an LNP-encapsulated product. Data presented demonstrate that LNPs are lysed, and mRNA hydrolyzes into nucleobases, in a single hydrolysis step using formic acid at elevated temperatures (140 \u00b0C). Nucleobase quantity is traceable through well-characterized reference standards, and individual nucleobase mass fractions can serve as independent surrogates of the mRNA mass fraction. Additionally, this technique can concurrently monitor protein contamination (via amino acid detection) and DNA contamination (via thymine detection) during LC-MS analysis.",

The 5\u2032 UTR contained a Kozak sequence, whereas the 3\u2032 UTR was designed with sequences from murine alpha-globin. In vitro transcription was performed overnight at 37 \u00b0C. \n\nLNP Formulation. LNPs were created by mixing fluids together in a microfluidic device (25,46). In the 100% ethanol phase, we added all the lipid components. In the low pH 10 mM citrate phase, we added the nucleic acids. The PEG-lipid, helper lipid, and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti. \n\nNanoparticle Characterization. LNP hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were measured using DLS (DynaPro Plate Reader II, Wyatt). Monodisperse LNPs with 50 nm < hydrodynamic diameter < 200 nm were pooled and dialyzed into 1X PBS. Next, the mRNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following sterile purification using a 0.22\u03bcm filter (Foxx Life Sciences). Prior to injection, a portion of the LNP pool (\"input\") was kept for the normalization step of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the barcodes derived from sorted samples. The mRNA dose was adjusted by the volume of injected LNPs per gram of mice through tail vein. \n\nAs previously described (20), the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Precision Nanosystems RiboGreen assay protocol were used to quantify the encapsulation efficiency of each LNP. Fifty microliters of LNP at 0.006 \u00b5g/\u03bcL was added to 50 \u03bcL of 1X TE or 50 of 1:50 dilution of Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich). Following a 10-min, 37 \u00b0C incubation, 100 \u03bcL of RiboGreen reagent was added to each well, and the fluorescence (485 nm excitation, 528 nm emission) was quantified.",

            "text": "The analysis of mRNA-LNPs requires disruption of the protective encapsulating LNP as only free mRNA molecules can be evaluated by CGE-LIF. The profile of the released mRNA can then be visualized as a single sharp peak, containing intact mRNA, and a broad earlier eluting shoulder, containing mRNA fragments [12]. Later-migrating peaks or tailing are often attributed to other mRNA-related impurities [12,25,27]. \n\nGiven the importance of disruption in sample preparation, two common disruption protocols were evaluated. These were mRNA-LNP treatment with detergent (Triton X-100) and precipitation by organic solvent (isopropanol) [25,33,36]. After mRNA-LNP samples were disrupted by Triton X-100, fluorescence intensity of the main peak was significantly impacted, even at low detergent concentrations (Figure 2A), which also resulted in lower integrity measurements and increased variability compared to isopropanol treatment (Table 2). These observations were recapitulated with an in-house formulated FLuc-LNP sample (Figure 2B), suggesting that isopropanol precipitation removal of non-precipitating buffer components improves assay sensitivity. However, a comparison between the disrupted FLuc-LNP and untreated FLuc mRNA at matching concentrations reveal that even isopropanol precipitation disruption can incur signal or sample loss on analysis (Figure 2C), suggesting that comparisons between drug substances and drug products must be carefully interpreted. This can be only partially attributed to the lipid content of mRNA-LNP samples, as mock disruptions with RNA ladder and FLuc mRNA only were less impacted overall, though 10% Triton X-100 addition still had the greatest effect (Figure 2D and Figure S3). Because these mock disruptions were performed on naked RNA, any detergent interactions with lipids that could further interfere with the fluorescence would not be observed. Interestingly, when control RNA and mRNA-LNP samples were disrupted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, high detergent concentrations also appeared to disrupt electrophoretic mobility, causing faint bands and streakiness (Figure S4).",

            "text": "Gene expression quantification plays a central role in a wide variety of studies, including biomedical research with clinical relevance. Among the various methods available for gene expression analysis, the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most rapid, sensitive, accurate and precise method and its use in clinical diagnostic procedures is presently growing exponentially (1)(2)(3)(4)(5).\n\nWhile there is conflicting literature data, it is often suggested that RNA integrity and purity are important in order to obtain reliable results (6)(7)(8)(9). RNA degradation can occur due to inadequate sample handling, prolonged storage, suboptimal storage conditions or inter-laboratory shipment of samples (10,11). RNA may be degraded through exposure to heat or UV, or cleavage by RNAse enzymes. In addition, the presence of inhibiting components such as urea, salts, phenol, heparin or other agents used during sampling or RNA extraction may also compromise with results (12). It would seem, therefore, that a rigorous assessment of RNA integrity and purity is essential before using RNA samples in downstream applications, especially if diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic conclusions will be drawn. Unfortunately, proper RNA quality control is lacking in a substantial number of studies (4). While it is recently listed as a required element in the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines (13), there remains a great need to explore in detail the implications of RNA quality on the final results.\n\nVarious methods have been proposed for the assessment of RNA integrity, most often through measurement of the size of the ribosomal subunit RNA molecules. Importantly though, in RT-qPCR analyses, messenger RNA is the target and not the ribosomal RNA transcripts. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to directly assess the quality of the mRNA fraction. In addition, PCR-based methods assessing RNA quality might be more relevant given the fact that the targets are also measured using the same technology when doing RT-qPCR.\n\nIn this study, two qPCR-based assays using minute amounts of RNA for investigation of mRNA integrity or purity were first validated in RNA samples from cultured neuroblastoma cells and subsequently applied along with microfluidic",

            "text": "Since the approval of the initial COMIR-NATY and SpikeVax monovalent vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, there have been on-market multivalent mRNA vaccines as well as ongoing clinical trials for multivalent vaccines targeting multiple subtypes or variants of a single pathogen [14 -16], including bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines [14,15], multivalent influenza vaccines targeting 4 hemagglutinin (HA) [14,16] proteins and neuraminidase (NA) proteins [16,17], and combination seasonal influenza/COVID-19 vaccine targets [14,16]. \n\nmRNA comprises (5 \u2032 to 3 \u2032 ) a 5 \u2032 cap, a 5 \u2032 untranslated region (UTR), the coding sequence for the antigen of interest, a 3 \u2032 UTR, and a 3 \u2032 polyA tail [18,19]. The 5 \u2032 cap and 3 \u2032 polyA tail allow for efficient translation, and the UTRs are designed to optimize protein expression [19]. A single mRNA molecule can be designed to code for multiple peptides [9]; alternatively, multiple mRNAs that each encode for a different protein can be mixed to create a multivalent vaccine formulation. The mRNA(s) is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to stabilize the mRNA, enable cellular uptake of the mRNA(s) for protein expression [19], and improve the in vivo stability of mRNA. \n\nAnalytics for measuring mRNA critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as identity, concentration, and integrity throughout the vaccine manufacturing process are emerging and evolving, but many existing tools are inherently singleplex and therefore not compatible with characterizing multivalent mRNA and may not be optimal for characterizing mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [20][21][22][23]. The absorbance-based quantification of nucleic acids can be performed quickly and easily using UV spectroscopy for naked mRNA or via the fluorescence-based RiboGreen assay for mRNA encapsulated in LNPs [23]. However, absorbance-based methods can only measure total mRNA content and cannot provide information about integrity or distinguish the concentration of each unique mRNA in a multivalent mixture.",

There was no change in mRNA integrity for the -20\u00b0C sample over 90 days. The 4\u00b0C sample showed a slight \u223c10% decrease in mRNA integrity over 90 days, suggesting that in 360 days the product would have decreased 50% from the original starting mRNA. The 90 day stability data suggest that better formulation is needed in order to have long-term (>2 years) stability of this particular product at temperatures above -20\u00b0C. The results demonstrate that the current MCE method can be used to analyze % mRNA purity for release and % mRNA integrity for a stability indicating assay. Data from two heat stress degradation studies of mRNA-LNP samples were used to assess the effect of temperature on the reaction kinetics of mRNA degradation. The natural logarithm of the mRNA degradation initial rate constant was plotted against the inverse temperature, as shown in Fig. 5C. The negative slope of this linear plot indicates that the mRNA degradation kinetics follow Arrhenius behavior with activation energy of 74.8 \u00b1 0.8 kJ/mol (n = 2). The linear Arrhenius relationship indicates that the reaction kinetic is simple and minimally influenced by structure formation and other factors [22]. The relatively low activation energy correlates with the low melting temperature (33-50\u00b0C) measured by DSC in a naked mRNA, and according to Qi and Frishman classification, it falls in the low thermostability (T m < 46\u00b0C) region which has a weaker sequence-structure relationship and less thermostable RNA secondary structure [23]. Furthermore, the activation energy (E a ) of 74.8 kJ/mol calculated from our heat stress experiments is relatively comparable to RNA cleavage in a model system with E a of 121 kJ/mol [22] and RNA cleavage by the hammerhead ribozyme with E a of 55 kJ/mol [24].",

            "text": "Health authorities have highlighted the need to determine oligonucleotide aggregates. However, existing technologies have limitations that have prevented the reliable analysis of size variants for large nucleic acids and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In this work, nucleic acid and LNP aggregation was examined using prototype, low adsorption ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the column\u2019s physicochemical properties. A large difference in aggregate content (17.8 vs 59.7 %) was found for a model messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by different manufacturers. We further investigated the nature of the aggregates via a heat treatment. Interestingly, thermal stress irreversibly decreased the amount of aggregates from 59.7 to 4.1% and increased the main peak area 3.3-fold. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, plasmid DNA topological forms and multimers were separated by analytical SEC. The degradation trends were compared to the data obtained with an anion exchange chromatography method. Finally, unconjugated and fragment antigen-binding (Fab)-guided LNPs were analyzed and their elution times were plotted against their sizes as measured by DLS. Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) was coupled to SEC in order to gain further insights on large species eluting before the LNPs, which were later identified as self-associating LNPs. This study demonstrated the utility of ultrawide pore SEC columns in characterizing the size variants of large nucleic acid therapeutics and LNPs.",

            "text": "Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that m6A is the most abundant modification in naturally occurring mRNAs. It is present in approximately 0.5% of intracellular transcripts, including mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circRNAs [52][53][54][55]. Based on these findings, research on the types of modifications in naturally occurring RNAs may provide new directions for the sequence design and optimization of circRNA vaccines, which will contribute to the enhancement of circRNA vaccine quality. In recent decades, the US FDA has introduced the quality-by-design approach in the development and quality control of new drugs. This concept can also provide guidance for the development, design, and quality control of circRNA vaccines. \n\nCurrently, there is a lack of guidance documents issued by regulatory agencies for quality control research on circRNA vaccines. Due to the unique synthesis process and reaction products of circRNAs, purity has become a critical quality attribute that requires close monitoring when performing quality control of circRNA vaccines. Commonly used analytical methods such as CE are incapable of effectively distinguishing between circRNAs and nicked circRNAs, thereby posing methodological requirements for purity analyses of circRNA vaccines. Validation of the RP-HPLC method established in this study has deemed it suitable for the identification and separation of circRNAs and nicked circRNAs. \n\nIn the future, it can also be used in purity analysis and quality control studies of circRNA vaccines. Other novel circRNA identification methods besides HPLC, such as CE, should also be optimized to achieve the distinction between circRNAs and nicked circRNAs, providing further enhancement of analytical methodologies for circRNA vaccines. Lastly, we determined that the circRNA substance exhibited the \"circular\u2192nicked\u2192degradation products\" degradation pattern under conditions of thermal pressurization. Recent research on RNA vaccine products has observed that linear mRNAs can undergo adduction reactions with the degradation products of LNPs (e.g., aldehyde molecules), resulting in mRNA degradation and reduced expression activity levels [28]. However, the degradation patterns of circRNAs in LNP-containing circRNA vaccine products remain unclear.",

            "text": "The determination of free mRNA DS present in the final mRNA-LNP DP informs the efficiency of the encapsulation process and stability of the DP. As discussed in the introduction, the large size of both the mRNA and LNP is an obstacle to their separation using SEC columns with a pore size lower than 300 \u00c5. Figure 4 shows the SEC profiles obtained for a Cre mRNA standard (1350 nts) and various mRNA-LNP samples. The various LNPs represent real-world samples and are more heterogeneous and complex in nature than the monodisperse markers usually tested to characterize SEC materials. \n\nThe Cre mRNA standard eluted at 30.08 min (black traces on Figure 4) while the main peak of the various LNPs eluted between 24.39 and 25.43 min (blue, orange, and green traces on Figure 4), demonstrating the ability of the SEC columns to resolve the free mRNA from the intact LNPs. Interestingly, various elution times were observed for the LNP 1, 2, and 3 batch traces. The largest differences in elution times were observed between LNPs with or without conjugation to Fab ligands (LNPs B\u2212C), which eluted earlier than the unconjugated LNPs (LNPs A). \n\nWe then further evaluated whether these elution time differences could be correlated to the LNP size, as determined by DLS (Figure 4B). First, the elution times of the unconjugated LNP1-A, LNP2-A, and LNP3-A correlated with their size determined by DLS (R 2 > 0.99), demonstrating the effect of changing the PEG-lipid on the LNP size. In addition, for the LNP2 and LNP3 series, SEC elution times were found to be correlated with the size measured by DLS (R 2 > 0.96). However, there was no correlation with LNP 1 series. This may be related to the difference in PEG-lipids used to synthesize LNPs 1, 2, and 3. PEGylation of lipids helps to prevent or limit the aggregation of LNPs by shielding their hydrophobic surface. 25",

            "text": "Finally, the performance of CGE-LIF was compared to IP-RPLC, an orthogonal technique for mRNA sizing. Analysis of the same RNA markers from Figure 1 showed generally lower resolution and sizing accuracy by IP-RPLC (Figure 4A). When RNA ladder linearity was assessed for both techniques, the migration pattern was biphasic [40] with CGE-LIF offering better separation across the entire fragment range. The resolution for IP-RPLC was overall low, but particularly for higher molecular weight (>2.5 kb) fragments. \n\nFor mRNA-LNPs, similar observations were made. Although a main peak was evident by IP-RPLC, a clear shoulder could not be clearly delineated from the main peak. Integration values also differed (Table 4). Integrity by IP-RPLC was consistently higher than CGE-LIF, likely due to its lower resolving power and broader peaks obscuring similarly sized fragments within the main peak. \n\nHowever, IP-RPLC analysis of mRNA-LNP samples disrupted with both 1% and 10% Triton X-100 clearly revealed the interference of Triton X-100 peaks with the main mRNA peak (Figure 4B), demonstrating that uncharged excipients or impurities can be efficiently detected. In comparison, in CGE-LIF, these same samples only resulted in diminished signal intensity and altered mRNA peak shape, which could lead to different conclusions of sample purity or integrity. Method accuracy would need to be determined with a well-characterized reference standard.",

Processing of the samples progressed further as instructed using the kit materials, and the final preparations of total RNA in RNAse-free water were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C awaiting the next steps. RNA yields and initial working stock concentrations for each sample (Supplementary Materials Table S5) were calculated using the ratio of 260/280 nm absorbance values (= 2.1 for all samples), measured by means of the microdrop technique in a Synergy-HT plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). RNA integrity for each sample was assessed in agarose gels using a Bioanalyzer (Model 2100, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), with all sample RIN values = 10 (Not shown) [247]. \n\nRNA degradation plots were generated using arrayQuality Metrics [248], utilizing preprocessed data (subjected to background correction and normalization). The individual arrays exhibited virtually parallel traces with no obvious outliers, and all lines had overall slopes (5 to 3 in the x axis) between 3.0 and 3.3 (results not shown), indicating excellent preservation of integrity encompassing samples both within and across treatment groups. The integrity and degradation determinations aided in ruling out DEG results being ascribed to differences in sample handling and processing, as well as inconsistencies in probe chip performance or quality control [249].",

            "text": "The ability to deliver mRNA to a target location holds promise for a variety of disease indications. In order to achieve the full potential that mRNA-based therapies have to offer, there is a need for advanced delivery systems that can deliver the mRNA in an efficient manner to target cells. Targeted delivery allows for reduction of potential side effects and increased payload delivery. 2,3 Nanoparticles (NPs) can achieve organ/cell specificity (through both passive and active targeting methods), payload release control, and solubility improvement. 3 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in particular have emerged as a promising delivery vehicle for mRNA due to their ability to protect the mRNA and achieve targeting specificity. Optimization of LNP formulations has thus become a major effort in the field. \n\nFactors such as the protein corona effect limit an exact understanding of why some formulations effectively target different organs and cells, 4 which makes ''rational'' design of NPs for specific targets challenging. Large-scale NP screening is therefore an important strategy for identifying the most effective formulations, but current methods are low throughput and therefore potentially miss the most promising formulations. 3 mproved methods for large-scale in vivo screening are particularly important because in vitro models cannot accurately model the biodistribution that occurs within the body. However limitations in current in vivo methods include throughput and the use of a large sum of animals and/or use transgenic animal models that do not allow for larger animal models to be used. 5 Therefore, there is a need for a more advanced high-throughput in vivo screening method. \n\nThe recent publication in Nature Biomedical Engineering, titled ''Peptideencoding mRNA barcodes for the highthroughput in vivo screening of libraries of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery,'' addresses this gap with a peptide barcoding assay that, when paired with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), has the ability to screen tissue targeting NP formulations in a highthroughput and in vivo manner. 1 Briefly, this new method leverages different peptide barcodes correlating to different LNPs to enable screening of multiple LNPs within the same mouse.",

            "text": "Although this understanding is gradually forming in the biotherapeutic context for mRNA products [25,[31][32][33], many studies examine only naked mRNA [12,26,34] or use proprietary buffer formulations with closed instrumentation [35,36]. Although informative, unknown impurities may go uninvestigated due to missing components or unpredictable interactions with undisclosed components. Indeed, lipids are important to the mRNA impurity profile as Packer et al. reported the discovery of novel mRNA-lipid impurities, which were undetectable in a CGE method but present by IP-RPLC [25]. Interestingly, late-migrating impurities have been reported by CGE but only in the absence of formamide [27]. Both reports suggest that the differing method components of CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) and IP-RPLC can result in different impurity profiles, which needs to be better understood. Given the emergence of this modality and the potential for novel impurities, it will be important to establish standard methods to accurately assess known CQAs while also maintaining the means to characterize unknown impurities through customizable methods. \n\nTo address the knowledge gaps of CGE-LIF and IP-RPLC method performance for mRNA-LNPs, we used a large commercial mRNA-LNP product (\u223c4200 b) to systematically evaluate critical method parameters for CGE-LIF and compared them to IP-RPLC. Both methods have been proposed for mRNA quality assessments [27]. In this study, we first examined how common gel additivesurea, formamide, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-impacted CGE-LIF resolution of an RNA ladder. Next, we evaluated how LNP disruption affects integrity measurements for the mRNA-LNP. Leveraging these observations, an experimental design was implemented to investigate both main and interaction effects of urea, formamide, and dye percentage. CGE-LIF performance was then compared to IP-RPLC analysis. Finally, a discussion on designing methods for consistency and standardization from a biotherapeutic perspective will be presented.",

The peak at +18 S is easily assigned to free While LNP-2 (Figure 2A, blue line) is floating (peak at around \u2212100 S), LNP-3 (Figure 2A, red line) is sedimenting (main peak at around +10 S) in addition to a broad and noisy floating component.This suggests that LNP-3 particles are not well formed, quite heterogeneous and with a significant amount of non-encapsulated mRNA.The initial characterization with DLS analysis and encapsulation efficiency (Table 1) demonstrated some indication that LNP-3 is different from LNP-1 and LNP-2 but did not reach the level information provided by AUC data.The shift of the sedimentation coefficient distribution to more negative sedimentation coefficient (s) values compared to LNP1 (in case of both formulations) might be correlated to the difference in encapsulation efficiency.Particles containing less mRNA have lower density and tend to float faster [7].\n\nThe two samples LNP-2 and LNP-3 have been synthesized using two different aliquots of the same FLUC mRNA batch.Figure 2B clearly shows that the mRNA-II starting material (used for the LNP-3 formulation), although presenting a similar sedimentation coefficient for the main component, has a different sedimentation coefficient distribution compared to mRNA-I used for the production of LNP-1 and LNP-2.The presence of several peaks with positive sedimentation values (Figure 2B, red line) suggests a possible fragmentation of the starting material or the presence of significant product contamination.\n\nTo assess the capacity of AUC to detect changes in the LNP-mRNA particle formulations, we disrupted the LNP-1 sample by controlled sonication.The use of a vial tweeter sonicator allows us to finely control and reproduce the amount of energy while avoiding possible contamination.",

            "text": "In effect, because SYBR Green II is an intercalating dye [50], its binding to RNA could be biased based on molecular structure [42]. However, it is worth noting that both the addition of sieving polymer and in-sample formamide also reduced signal intensity without affecting denaturation, suggesting multiple mechanisms at play, including viscosity effects. \n\nEncapsulation by LNPs is a critical aspect of biotherapeutic mRNA analysis. As a result, LNP disruption is often required for product analysis [33]. Many bioanalytical studies, however, focus on naked mRNA analysis, which can overlook complex matrix interactions. To maintain relevance to biotherapeutics, we used commercial mRNA-LNP products to show that LNP disruption does have an impact on the quality profile by CGE-LIF. Common detergent disruption appeared to interfere with signal intensity and RNA mobility, negatively impacting integrity. Thus, care should be taken when interpreting analyses between detergent-disrupted mRNA-LNP samples and naked mRNA samples, such as between mRNA-LNP drug products and mRNA drug substances. Analysis of in-process intermediates should include relevant matrix controls and appropriate reference standards. \n\nRemoving non-precipitating buffer components would improve assay sensitivity. \n\nDefining the standards for comparative analyses of CGE-LIF profiles is challenging, especially in the shoulder region where a complexity of analytes can be masked in the area under the curve. Traditionally, peak areas are corrected based on the migration time of the peak; however, approaches based on identifying migration time by the peak apex may introduce variability or bias, especially when comparing \"smoother\" shoulders with fewer peaks to \"noisier\" shoulders. It may be beneficial to explore standard integration practices or the impact of alternative correction approaches such as weighted integrations. Resolution in CGE-LIF analysis of mRNA is another criteria that can be difficult to define because the shoulder contains a mixture of fragments not fully separated from the main peak. Traditional resolution metrics, such as the separation of two well-defined peaks [51], would not be applicable. Systematic approaches, such as full factorial design of experiments, allow for the comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of all factor combinations and their responses.",

            "text": "Characterization of LNPs is challenging because they are heterogeneous mixtures of large complex particles. There are limited methods for surface charge LNP characterization that have been explored including CE. To better characterize the surface charge of LNP drug delivery systems, we have developed a new icIEF method. This method uses a commercially available cIEF instrument and can measure the pI of LNPs formulated with or without mRNA. The icIEF method can reproducibly measure the apparent pI of LNPs, provided that the cationic lipid concentration is known. With detection at 280 nm, the observed signal is proportional to the LNP concentration. Surface charge of an LNP is found to be primarily driven by the cationic lipid, implying that this lipid is at the surface of the LNP. In addition, this method is capable of differentiating LNPs containing different cationic lipids and is suitable as a test for LNP identity. More importantly, it is a stability-indicating assay, which can be used to support process and formulation development for LNP-based mRNA vaccines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of icIEF applied to an LNP-based drug delivery system. \n\nWe would like to thank our colleagues, specifically Dave Boyd in Vaccine Process Development for providing the LNP samples, Jessica Raffaele for generating stability samples, Katrina Fritts for dynamic light scattering technical guidance, and Alyssa Deiss for grammatical suggestions. We also would like to thank Richard Peluso for his support.

            "text": "LNP loading of mRNA requires complicated procedures, which hamper the widespread clinical application of the mRNA LNPs. In this study, we developed a simple, robust and versatile procedure for mRNA LNP preparation by mRNA PEGylation. Using this strategy, mRNA-loaded LNPs with regulated sizes and close-to-neutral surface charges were prepared just by mixing two aqueous solutions of parent LNP and mRNA without the need of buffer exchange for subsequent biological usage (Figures 3-6). Such easy procedure allows LNP preparation even at bedside, which additionally provides a solution to the issue of mRNA storage. Although lyophilization is an attractive approach for long-term storage of mRNA without degradation [27], lyophilization of mRNA-loaded LNPs could influence their physicochemical properties. On the other hand, lyophilization of mRNA molecule is an established technique, allowing long-term mRNA storage even at room temperature [28]. Our strategy would allow preparation of mRNA-loaded LNPs immediately after rehydration of lyophilized mRNA, minimizing time of mRNA storage in aqueous solution. \n\nFor mRNA PEGylation, 17 nt PEG-OligoRNAs were hybridized to mRNA. Importantly, addition of PEG-OligoA, an unhybridizing control, failed to prevent LNP aggregation (Figure 3c,d), demonstrating the importance of mRNA PEGylation through hybridization of PEG-OligoRNAs. Moreover, hybridization of 20 PEG-OligoRNAs per mRNA induced minimal influence on translational activity of mRNA (Figure 2). This result is consistent with our previous report of mRNA-engineering, showing that short RNA oligonucleotides possessing functional moieties can be hybridized to mRNA with preserved translational activities [19]. Cellular mechanisms of unwinding dsRNA in an ATP-consuming manner presumably contributed to efficient translation from mRNA hybridized with short RNA oligonucleotides [29]. \n\nLNP PEGylation showed large influence on in vivo blood circulation profile after systemic injection (Figure 8). LNPs loaded with non-PEGylated mRNA formed aggregates immediately after the injection, leading to rapid clearance of the LNPs from the blood circulation.",

            "text": "From the discussion above, it is clear that the major determinants for the stability of the mRNA-LNP drug product includes (1) length of the mRNA chain, (2) the secondary/tertiary structure of the mRNA and the mRNA-LNP complex, (3) selection of nucleotides, and (4) drug product formulation composition including associated impurities (e.g., lipid type and source, excipient type and source, solution pH) . Alishetty et al. 97 calculated the half-lives of free FLuc mRNA at room temperature with an equation published by Li and Breaker. 98 This equation doesn't take secondary structural effects into account. The outcome of the calculation was a lower degradation rate for a free mRNA molecule compared to the mRNA in two LNP formulations. Moreover, a clear degradation rate dependence on the type of ionizable lipid was observed. 97 These effects could potentially be explained by the formation of stabilizing secondary/tertiary structures of the free mRNA, which are disturbed in the complexation with LNP, or by local upward pH shifts inside the LNP because of the presence of closely packed cationic lipids or the higher 'proton solvation energy'. 97,99,100 hortening the mRNA chain length may reduce the chance of chain breakage resulting in the inactivation of the mRNA. Zhao et al. employed a shortened mRNA chain length of 1100 nt (nucleotides) compared to 4000+ nt for the Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines, and showed 76% intact mRNA, no change in particle size-polydispersity index or encapsulation efficiency, and preserved immunogenicity in mice after six months of storage at 2-8 \u00b0C. 101 he choice of the cationic lipid influences LNP-mRNA stability as reported by Ripoll et al. who used imidazole cationic lipids with a flexible connection between lipid and headgroup, and they found enhanced stability compared to 'reference' cationic lipids. 102 Multiprotic cationic lipids reportedly have a similar stabilizing effect. 97",

            "text": "The external buffer was then replaced with PBS by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal units. The resultant mRNA-LNPs showed an encapsulation efficiency of over 90% and were approximately 100 nm in size, with a PdI value below 0.1. The surface of the mRNA-LNPs was neutral since the Zeta potential was in the range of \u00b15 mV. The sample in PBS was stored at 4 \u2022 C for periods of up to 28 days (Table 1). Time-dependent changes in the particle properties and the gene expression efficiency were evaluated after 0, 7, 14, and 28 days (Figure 2). While changes in the particle properties (i.e., mRNA encapsulation efficiency, mRNA recovery efficiency, size, PdI, and zeta potential) were all negligible (Table 1), the gene expression efficiency was drastically reduced in a storage time-dependent manner (Figure 2). In the first 7 days, the gene expression efficiency decreased to approximately half (49%) of that for the original preparation. In the next 21 days, the gene expression efficiency decreased gradually but steadily, eventually reaching 21% of the original preparation. These data clearly confirm that the long-time storage of the LNPs in suspension form impairs their gene expression efficiency, while the changes in the physicochemical properties of particles are marginal. To develop a stable lyophilized formulation, mRNA-LNPs were prepared via the alcohol dilution-lyophilization method (mRNA-LNPad). A schematic illustration of the method is shown in Figure 3. In the case of conventional microfluidic mixing, the solvent for the lipid is ethanol. Since it is difficult to freeze ethanol because of its low melting temperature, the solvent for the lipids was replaced with tertiary butanol (tBuOH). The high melting temperature of tBuOH is suitable for the lyophilization process [25]. The LNP was first formulated by microfluidic mixing as the ethanol dilution method. After the mixing, sucrose was added to the LNPs as a cryo-protectant. The mixture was then freeze-dried to produce the actual lyophilized formulation (Figures S1 and S2).",

Based on this observation, all the IVT mRNAs applied in following investigations were prepared via enzymatic capping approach. We further evaluated the properties of purified IVT mRNAs versus unpurified counterparts after encapsulation in LNP, including their particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI). The LNP encapsulating the purified mRNA (LNP-P) exhibited better uniformity and smaller sizes than those from counterpart with unpurified mRNA (LNP-U); both groups predominantly exhibited as negatively charged nanoparticles (Fig. 3F). Additionally, the purification process had minimal impact on the morphology of the nanoparticles (Fig. 3G), the encapsulation efficiency of LNP formulations and the IVT mRNA capping rates (Fig. 3H), implying the advantages of this purification approach in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of IVT mRNA within LNP. All these results indicate that we successfully developed an affinity chromatography-based IVT mRNA purification method by which unwanted impurities, including dsRNA, could be efficiently removed in order to obtain high-quality IVT mRNA.",

The formation of a secondary degradation of impurities was observed after 14 days (dark red traces on Figure 3) with the presence of a late eluting peak on the SEC profile (t E > 21 min) and early eluting peak on the AEC profile (t R < 10 min). The broad peak observed on both AEC and SEC profiles was associated with heterogeneous fragment size populations. The production of fragments after the appearance of denaturation products would be expected later in the thermal stress period. Despite the possible formation of heterogeneous impurities, the AEC and SEC profiles of the control sample (black traces in Figure 4) bracketing the stressed sample injections remained the same. This demonstrated the suitability of the methods and instrumentation. \n\nSample carryover was evaluated for the open-circular form, supercoiled form, and dimeric impurity. Using AEC, the relative peak areas of the open-circular form, supercoiled form, and dimeric impurity in a blank sample were 3.9, 0.2, and 4.3% to those integrated for the corresponding peaks of a pDNA standard injected before. With SEC, the relative peak areas were reduced to 1.2, 0.5, and <0.1% for the dimeric impurity, open-circular form, and supercoiled form, respectively. The low carryover achieved by SEC could help in improving the accuracy of open-circular impurity measurements. \n\nOverall, the SEC and AEC traces provided orthogonal information that enabled more certain identification of the impurities present in the pDNA samples. The employed prototype ultrawide pore SEC columns showed powerful resolution of multimeric species that would likely not be achievable on columns packed with smaller pore size particles. \n\nDetermination of Multiple Attributes for mRNA-LNPs.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as nanocarriers for the delivery of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have sparked a profound change in the industry sector, due to their success in delivering vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful global implementation of LNPs has seen a rapid growth in research into their applications for the delivery of cargo in a range of therapy areas of unmet clinical need. Alterations in LNP constituent lipids and ratios have led to the discovery of a broad spectrum of prospective nanomedicine candidates in pharmaceutical industry pipelines, increasing the popularity of LNPs and their versatility and applicability to a diverse molecular portfolio [1][2][3][4][5]. \n\nThe successful clinical and commercial translation of LNPs for oligonucleotide delivery depends on acceptable formulation physicochemical stability of the nanocarrier during its shelf life, and the ability to protect oligonucleotide cargo from premature degradation. Highlighted by recent reviews [6,7], there is a critical need for the development of orthogonal analytical pipelines to profile prototype LNP physicochemical attributes during early formulation development stages. Once manufactured, the LNP formulation critical quality attributes (CQAs) are quantified using established techniques, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS: size and polydispersity), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS: zeta potential) and the RiboGreen\u2122 assay (drug encapsulation efficiency and recovery) [8][9][10]. Due to significant research interest and field novelty, the characterisation of prototype LNP candidates remains on a case-by-case basis. Continuing the process to harmonise the measurement of LNP physicochemical attributes, the Nanotechnology Characterisation Laboratory (NCL) and European NCL have issued guidelines for the analysis of prototype nanoparticulate formulations [11][12][13]; they recommend the use of at least one low-resolution technique and an orthogonal high-resolution technique for the measurement of nanoparticle size, ensuring that robust and representative results are obtained while standardised reference materials are under development.",

An RNA standard calibration curve was prepared by diluting the RNA provided with the kit to a concentration range of 0.02-0.6 \u00b5g/ml. The total RNA concentration of the LNPs was 1 g/L and diluted accordingly in Tris-EDTA buffer. Triton-X 100 in a concentration of 0.2% (v/v) was used to break the LNPs apart and release the encapsulated RNA.\n\nParticle sizes and PDI were determined on a Malvern Zetasizer Ultra. The samples were diluted in water and measured. The measurement is performed at 22 \u2022 C in the \"General Mode\" of the software. The Z average is given as \"size (nm),\" which is the intensity-weighted mean hydrodynamic size of the ensemble collection of particles measured by dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, the PDI is given. PDI values greater than 0.25 determined at 174.7 \u2022 suggest a broad particle size distribution, which is one sign of low quality materials. This can be seen, for example, after an extended storage of the LNPs, as the PDI is increasing over time as the aggregation of particles occurs. Freshly produced LNP batches show PDI values smaller than 0.2, which shows a much narrower particle size distribution and therefore a homogenous formulation process.",

LNP stability and bilayer fluidity are determined by the identities and the amounts of the various lipids employed in the formulation and LNP efficacy is determined in large part by the lipid composition which usually contains a cationic lipid, a PEG\u2010lipid conjugate, cholesterol, and a zwitterionic helper phospholipid. Analytical methods developed for LNP characterization must be able to determine not only the identity and content of each individual lipid component (i.e., the parent lipids), but also the associated impurities and degradants. In this work, we describe an efficient and sensitive reversed\u2010phase chromatographic method with charged aerosol detection (CAD) suitable for this purpose. Sample preparation diluent and mobile phase pH conditions are critical and have been optimized for the lipids of interest. This method was validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity for lipid analysis to support process and formulation development for new drugs and vaccines.",

Similarly, the mRNA-LNP samples were first diluted to a mRNA concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL in a solution of 10% w/v Brij \u00ae 58 in formamide. Then, samples were further diluted in formamide and 5 \u00b5L of 10X sample buffer from the RNA reagent kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for a final total sample volume of 50 \u00b5L (10 \u00b5g/mL mRNA final concentration). The final formamide concentration in the sample was always >80%. All final sample solutions were heated in a 70 \u2022 C heating block for 10 min, then cooled on ice for at least 5 min. Samples were transferred to a 96-well plate before testing on the LabChip GXII Touch (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The RNA lab chip was prepared as described in the RNA Assay Quick Guide provided by Perkin Elmer without any modifications. Each component of the main peak and fragments was calculated as a percentage of the total peak area. The percent main peak area was reported as the % mRNA integrity.",

            "text": "To explore the capabilities of calorimetric and light scattering techniques for characterization of key attributes of viral and non-viral delivery vectors, a diverse range of mRNA-LNP, rAAV5 and liposomal samples covering a broad size and particle concentration range and carrying DNA and RNA payload were analyzed (Figure 1 and Table 3). In Figure 2, the PSD profiles of several viral and LNP-based delivery vectors measured by DLS and MADLS (Figure 2a,c,e,g) and NTA (Figure 2b,d,f,h), are compared to demonstrate the applicability and limitations of these approaches [30,57,58]. In Figure 2, the PSD profiles of several viral and LNP-based delivery vectors measured by DLS and MADLS (Figure 2a,c,e,g) and NTA (Figure 2b,d,f,h), are compared to demonstrate the applicability and limitations of these approaches [30,57,58]. \n\nThe use of these three analytical techniques help cover a wider size range with different resolution. DLS has the lowest resolution but provides a good indication of what particle sizes are present in the sample, as seen from its overlap with the other techniques (Figure 2). MADLS has improves measurement resolution compared to DLS [38] but not as high as NTA, as proven by the measurements of mRNA-LNP1 (Figure 2a) and MVA (Figure 2g) where it can identify additional populations present in the sample compared to DLS. However, MADLS PSD for the MVA sample does not show the full lower size range as seen with NTA. The difference in detection capability shown by MADLS for mRNA-LNP1 and MVA, where the former is fully captured but the latter is lacking detail of the lower end of the PSD, is due to the relative amount of light from the different populations present in the sample. For mRNA-LNP1, the aggregate peaks contribute 21% of the scattered light intensity, whereas for MVA, the largest aggregate peak contributes 51% of the scattered light, as determined from the peak areas for these populations. The aggregate peak in MVA is also much larger in size than the aggregate population in mRNA-LNP1.",

Poveda et al. reviewed key techniques currently available to monitor the critical quality attributes of mRNA vaccine candidates (Table 3). 32 We expanded the list by including additional assays to characterize attributes related to formulated (i.e., lipid-and/or proteincontaining) mRNA drug products including general quality attributes for parenterally administered vaccines. 19,33 Unfortunately, a critical review on analytical techniques to characterize mRNA-(cationic) lipid complexes, as has been published previously for plasmid DNA-lipid complexes, 34 is clearly missing. In summary, mRNA based product candidates for several therapeutic and prophylactic indications have been tested in the clinic and numerous publications have reported on the nature of the mRNA drug product involved. Nonetheless, key CMC information on the critical quality attributes and corresponding justification of acceptance criteria, especially as related to determining the stability profile of formulated mRNA drug products (i.e., shelf-life and storage temperature), has yet to reach the public domain.",

[201]Specifically, this fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) approach quantifies the delivery of mRNA by adding unique DNA barcodes into the mRNA-loaded LNP.They delivered mRNA encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored camelid VHH antibody (aVHH) (Figure 15B), which can be detected with an anti-aVHH antibody for quantifying the protein expressing level, thus investigating the delivery efficiency of LNP. Figure 15C shows that aVHH was successfully expressed and localized on the cell surface.Using the FIND method, they effectively measured the mRNA-delivering efficiency in multiple cell types of over 89 LNPs and picked out 10 top LNPs with different mRNA-delivery efficiency in different species-derived hepatocytes (Figure 15D).The method will help researchers to identify LNPs with specific cell tropisms and accelerate the clinical translation of mRNA-based LNP platforms. [202]valuating the targeting ability of mRNA-LNP is of great significance.Other property parameters like mRNA loading capacity in LNP also count greatly.As such, Li et al. developed a high throughput technique (named multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy) to assess the payload capacity of mRNA in LNP with a small sampling volume, which can be applied to the quality control in scaling up manufacturing of mRNA-LNPs. [203]Moreover, to obtain more pharmaceutical information on mRNA-based platforms before animal trials, three-dimensional coculture models of tumors may represent a superior approach to facilitating the study of mRNA therapy.

            "text": "The results from the stability study of quadrivalent mRNA LNPs, as depicted in Fig. 5, revealed similar trending between IVE-LC/MS/MS and IVE-flow cytometry. The LNPs' performance at different storage conditions (-80 \u00b0C and 5 \u00b0C) was assessed over a 12-month period. At -80 \u00b0C, the LNPs maintained consistent expression levels across all four antigens throughout the study duration, as observed among IVE-LC/MS/MS, the percentage of antigen positive cells and the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) by IVE-flow cytometry. Conversely, the LNPs stored at 5 \u00b0C displayed a noticeable decline in expression levels over time, as indicated by the IVE-LC/MS/MS assay. Although the flow cytometry data for the 9-and 12-month time points were not available, similar trending of %Antigen/HEK data and the other measurements was confirmed for the initial 0-, 1-, 3-, and 6-month time points. The consistency between IVE-LC/MS/MS and IVE-flow cytometry results underscores the robustness of these techniques in providing reliable data. IVE-LC/MS/MS was also used to evaluate the impact of buffer composition and shaking on LNP transfection. The results from buffer study highlight the significant value of the IVE-LC/MS/MS method in accurately assessing the impact of formulation buffers on mRNA transfection efficiency. By demonstrating a tenfold increase in in-vitro expression with the use of a 150 mM NaCl buffer, this method proves its sensitivity and precision. The shaking study's findings indicate that shaking time significantly impacts mRNA transfection efficiency and the quality attributes of LNPs. While 30 min of shaking showed no significant effect on antigen expression, a notable decrease in expression was observed after 240 min, particularly at the lowest mRNA concentration (0.01 mg/mL) compared to the high concentrations (0.12 and 0.06 mg/mL). Both IVE-LC/MS/MS and IVE-flow cytometry methods indicated that the sensitivity to shaking-induced changes was more pronounced in lower concentration mRNA-LNP formulations.",

            "text": "Although convenient instruments and kits have been marketed for mRNA-LNP analysis, the proprietary nature of these systems makes method customization and foundational research difficult. Thus, we chose an open-source CGE-LIF protocol [38] to clearly assess the impact of method parameters (Table 1). In addition to being highly accessible, a variant of this method has been proposed as an analytical procedure for integrity analysis of mRNA-LNP biotherapeutics [27]. \n\nInitial adaptation showed high reproducibility with prescribed standards: an RNA ladder (281 b-6583 b) and an RNA marker  1A). Some variation in intensity was observed, notably for the smallest 281 b fragment. On the basis of the ladder, the length of the RNA control was estimated at 2074 b, approximately 300 bases higher than the actual length; as calculated by linear regression of migration time and the natural log of RNA fragment length (Figure S1). \n\nBecause instrument parameters have been explored elsewhere [38], we focused on gel buffer additives. A characteristic property of RNA molecules is the propensity to form stable secondary structures, which interfere with size-based separations [39]. Denaturants, such as urea and formamide, are commonly used to improve resolution of large mRNA [17]. Accordingly, decreased urea concentrations in the gel buffer broadened RNA peaks and increased electrophoretic mobility, resulting in lower migration times (Figure 1B) reflecting previous reports [40]. Interestingly, the absence of urea also resulted in a large relative peak area of smaller fragments (Figure S2), which could be due to an enhanced electrokinetic injection bias. Although past studies have reported a decrease of fluorescence signal in the presence of urea [41,42], fragment-dependent impacts on intensity have not been reported to our knowledge. \n\nIn comparison, formamide is often added to samples for denaturation prior to analysis. In our hands, this treatment only showed minor improvements in peak resolution (Figure 1C) compared to without treatment (Figure 1B), suggesting that denaturation in-sample is insufficient for CGE-LIF analysis. Insample formamide also increased assay variability and decreased signal intensity.",

            "text": "In addition, icIEF can be employed to assess the surface charge of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccines (Loughney et al., 2019(Loughney et al., , 2602(Loughney et al., -2609)). This technique is capable of differentiating the pI of LNPs that contain one or more types of ionizable lipids, aiding in the verification of LNP identity during manufacturing processes. As a quantitative method, icIEF also provides insights into the stability of LNPs, making it applicable for both process optimization and formulation development of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it can distinguish between LNPs that incorporate various cationic lipids, serving as a useful tool for confirming the identity but also to study the correlation between LNP apparent pI and cationic lipids and mRNA concentrations. Four different batches of LNP containing different cationic lipid to mRNA ratios were subjected to icIEF analysis (Figure 11). The results indicate that the cationic lipid is situated on the surface of the LNP, while the mRNA is located within. This is a reasonable assumption, given that the LNP fulfils the function of a hydrophobic protective barrier, thereby protecting the mRNA. \n\nTwo distinct icIEF approaches have been developed, as reported in the literature, to evaluate the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines, particularly those encapsulated in LNPs. These methods are effective for characterising the stability of mRNA-loaded LNPs under different conditions, such as varied storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions, and are capable of detecting batch-to-batch variability. Overall, icIEF analysis has proven to be highly suitable for characterising mRNA vaccines. It has been an essential analytical tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to play a significant role in the development of future mRNA-based products (Krebs et al., 2022(Krebs et al., , 1971(Krebs et al., -1983)). The assessment of batch-to-batch consistency is of pivotal importance in the context of regulatory compliance. Consequently, other research groups developed robust and reproducible methodologies for the fulfilment of these tasks.",

            "text": "RNases in live cells are contained and degradation of mRNAs is strictly controlled as part of the cell's RNA metabolism. However, post sampling, during the preanalytical process, cells die, become permeabilized and/or lysed, which brings endogenous RNases into contact with RNA and exogenous RNases may enter leading to mRNA degradation. This can severely compromise quantitative gene expression analysis. In established workflows in pathology tissues are treated with formalin and embedded in paraffin (FFPE), which preserves samples' morphology but is deleterious to the RNA. These factors may profoundly influence measured expression levels leading to unreliable and in worst cases fatally incorrect results [17]. mRNA degradation is a particular severe problem when analysing tissues rich in RNases, such as pancreas and spleen. It may also be a problem when tissue or cell samples are frozen and then thawed, since freezing damages the cells, releasing RNases giving them access to the RNA. Equipment and reagents may also be contaminated with RNases leading to serious degradation. It is therefore critical to test the integrity of the RNA before performing serious analyses [18]. Traditionally this is done using electrophoresis, which works very well under many conditions, but has limitations.\n\nHere we have developed a new molecular approach based on measuring differential amplicons ( Amp) to assess specifically the integrity of mRNA for expression profiling studies and we have evaluated it on test systems, where RNA was degraded or damaged by exposure to ribonuclease, heat, ultraviolet radiation, and formalin. The approach is based on an Endogenous RNase Resistant (ERR) marker that is virtually resistant to RNases, which is assayed by RT-qPCR producing two amplicons of different length and also compared to a representative reference gene. Amp is compared to the current method based on assessing the integrity  of RNA by means of electrophoresis using the Experion (Bio-Rad) or Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).\n\nThe degree of damage caused by RNases is reflected by the differential expression of a reference gene(s) and the ERR marker. The reference genes are assumed to have been selected carefully and validated, such that their expression is stable across samples and invariant to the studied conditions.",

            "text": "To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol [69,70]. Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression. Cargos based on sgRNA [66] and mRNA [47] have been quantified using IP-RP LC, but the simultaneous quantification of multiple co-loaded RNA cargos in delivery systems remains a challenge [69]. Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis. The main benefit of IP-RP LC over other chromatographic modes (such as AEX, SEC, and SC) is that it can be easily coupled with MS, considerably broadening its field of application. IP-RP LC-MS is often used for measuring important structural features of mRNA molecules, such as 5 \u2032 capping efficiency and 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail length [43]. Structural characterizations for the capping efficiency and the poly(A) tail by LC-MS have been recently reviewed [41,43].",

            "text": "Advanced Analytical, RNA Integrity Number equivalent (RIN e ) introduced by Agilent, and the RNA Integrity Score (RIS) introduced by Qiagen. Although analyzing length distribution of RNA is today the most common approach to evaluate RNA integrity, its relevance for gene expression analysis has occasionally been called into question [6]. As outlined above the electrophoretic analysis reflects rather the integrity of ribosomal RNAs, which are quite different from the messenger RNAs and microRNAs typically studied. rRNAs have compact structures and are found in tight complexes with proteins, while mRNAs have an 3 A-tail and 5 -cap that are usually protein bound, which protects from certain nucleolytic degradation. mRNAs may also harbor internal sequences that are cleaved by endonucleases. Indeed, model studies of RNA degradation show rRNAs are degraded at quite different rates from mRNAs [6]. rRNA expression is further regulated differently from mRNA expression and is not expected to be appreciably affected by changes in environmental conditions, which may have profound effect on the expression of mRNAs [7]. The use of RIN to assess samples for miRNA analysis is even more questionable because of the very short length of microRNAs, and empirical data supporting such correlation is limited [8,9]. The impact of the chemical and structural differences between rRNAs and mRNA/miRNAs may further depend on the actual degradation mechanism. The precision of the electrophoretic assessment of RNA integrity depends on sample quality. While high RIN/RQI values are reproducible and reliable, results obtained on poor quality samples tend to show larger variation due to poor reproducibility of degradation and difficulties in modeling the increased background from the short fragments that form. Our experience is RIN/RQI below 5 are prone to substantial uncertainty and conclusions about quality are ambiguous. This is a major limitation of the electrophoretic approach, since borderline samples often have RIN <5. A more reliable assessment of mRNA integrity in samples of poor quality is therefore desirable to distinguish those were mRNA levels can be measured with reasonable accuracy from those where results would be so uncertain and unreliable that analysis is waste of time and money.\n\nAs alternative to the electrophoretic approach molecular methods have been proposed to assess RNA integrity.

            "text": "To date, several studies have investigated ways to stabilize mRNA and to stabilize LNPs during storage (Ball et al., 2016;Jones et al., 2007). It is, however, interesting to question which of these components is the bottleneck for stability. Is it the mRNA that degrades when the mRNA-LNP formulations are not frozen, are the LNPs causing the problem, or is it the combination of mRNA with the LNPs?\n\nLNP systems entrapping chemically modified and highly stable siRNA molecules (e.g. Onpattro) have significantly longer shelf lives as compared to mRNA-LNP systems. This would suggest that not the LNP, but rather the mRNA is the current stability bottleneck.\n\nTo date, there is no research report available in the public domain on the integrity of both mRNA and LNPs in mRNA-LNP formulations. In the few studies in which the effect of storage is investigated, such as the research by Zhang et al. (N.-N. Zhang et al., 2020), long-term effects are not measured. Therefore, we will be looking first at the long-term stability of naked mRNA, with the caveat that this may be different from the stability of mRNA encapsulated in LNPs (see below).\n\nIn their review Pascolo et al. remark that aqueous solutions of naked mRNA can be stored at 4 \u2022 C for only a few days, provided that the mRNA is protected from degradation by contaminating ribonucleases by an RNase inhibitor (Pascolo, 2008). This seems to be in line with the current view of mRNA instability. The existing body of research on the longterm stability of naked mRNA suggests that mRNA needs to be frozen or dried in order to stay stable for longer periods of time.\n\nIn 2009, Roesler et al. show that the translation efficacy of mRNA encoding luciferase begins to decrease after 8 days or 16 days when stored -RNAse free-at room temperature as a liquid or in a lyophilized form, respectively. No efforts were made to optimize the formulations in terms of excipients and freeze drying conditions (Fig. 7) (Roesler et al., 2009). Conclusions about the long-term stability",

            "text": "No significant difference in GP values was observed for both the lipid B-DOPE and lipid B-DEPE LNPs. \n\nBased on their in vivo results, we subjected the four LNPs to density-based separation using ultracentrifugation, to explore the nature and features of the subpopulations that could potentially exist in these \"parent\" formulations. As described in the method section, ultracentrifugation of the four LNPs loaded on the top of sucrose density gradients resulted in their separation into distinct density-based fractions (Figure 3), with the least dense topmost fraction (F) 1, followed by F2 and then F3 with increasing densities. Control experiments demonstrated that upon ultracentrifugation, both empty A- DOPE LNPs (without mRNA, Figure S2A) and the majority of the naked mRNA (unformulated hEPO mRNA, Figure S2B) remain at the top of the sucrose gradients, indicating lower density for both. All LNPs resolved into three separate fractions post-DGC, except for LNP B-DEPE, which resolved into two fractions (Figure 3A,F). Additional calibration DGC experiments performed with discontinuous vs continuous sucrose gradients, different types and amounts of mRNA payloads, showed identical trends in the resolution of fractions, in terms of their visual appearance, density, particle sizes, and mRNA yield (data not shown). \n\nFor the lipid A parent formulations, A-DOPE showed a slight trend of higher particle size for F1 (Figure 3B), while the PDI increased from F1 to F3 (n.s., Figure 3C) and EE% remained comparable across all fractions for both A-DOPE and A-DEPE LNPs (Figure 3D). The mRNA yield in the individual fractions, measured as the percentage of parent mRNA, decreased significantly from F1 to F3 (Figure 3E). Both lipid B parent formulations demonstrated decreasing particle sizes (Figure 3G), increasing PDI (Figure 3H), and comparable EE% (Figure 3I), with the denser fractions.",

            "text": "Despite these AI advancements, challenges remain. Efficient delivery systems capable of targeting specific cells or tissues are still under development, with LNPs leading the field. Innovations in LNP delivery systems support the efficient expression of mRNA while minimizing exonuclease degradation. Most FDA-approved mRNA vaccines require storing mRNA-LNPs at low (\u2212 20 \u00b0C) or ultra-low temperatures (\u2212 80 \u00b0C), complicating the distribution of mRNA vaccines in resource-limited settings [106]. As a result, the stringent requirements for cold chain logistics and storage of these vaccines significantly limit the clinical application and distribution of mRNA vaccines, due to the lack of transport links, refrigeration facilities, or stable power supplies [102]. The instability of mRNA-LNPs during storage is predominantly caused by chemical degradation through hydrolysis and oxidation reactions [102]. When mRNAs are kept in an aqueous environment for an extended time, the backbone of the mRNA will be cleaved, disrupting its secondary structure. To overcome this challenge, lyophilization has emerged as a promising strategy for improving mRNA-LNP stability and enabling storage at higher temperatures, for example in ambient temperatures or 4 \u00b0C. Moderna's lyophilized cytomegalovirus (CMV) mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1647) is currently in phase 3 clinical trials and has ensured a shelf life of up to 18 months when stored at 5 \u00b0C. Research by Gerhardt et al. [107] revealed that mRNA-1647 remains stable for over 8 months at room temperature and more than 21 months when stored at 4 \u00b0C. Ai et al. [108] demonstrated that lyophilized and reconstituted mRNA-LNP vaccines provide comparable protection against the COVID-19 Omicron variant in mice when compared to freshly prepared mRNA-LNP formulations, even after 6 months of storage at 4 \u00b0C or 25 \u00b0C. Notably, long-term storage of the lyophilized mRNA-LNPs did not result in any significant changes in key parameters, including nanoparticle size, polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation efficiency (EE), mRNA integrity, or lipid stability.",

If this is the case then it is possible that the mRNA would be better protected from external nucleases than mRNA contained in Onpattro-type systems containing 10 mol % DSPC, which exhibit only an external monolayer. 15 To determine whether this was the case we tested the stability of mRNA coding for GFP (GFP-mRNA) encapsulated in the 40% ESM formulation relative to an Onpattro formulation containing 10% DSPC. We used GFP-mRNA in this and subsequent in vivo experiments as a quantitative assessment of GFP expression in vivo in individual cells of various tissues can be achieved when GFP fluorescence is measured by flow cytometry. \n\nThe mRNA stability data obtained by the Bioanalyser analysis (see methods) are presented in Figure 3. As shown, naked mRNA was immediately degraded in serum, as also demonstrated by flattening of the mRNA peaks in the electropherogram and the disappearance of related bands in the gel images (see Figure S2). LNP mRNA encapsulated in LNPs with the Onpattro lipid composition (DSPC/MC3/ Chol/PEG-lipid 10:50:38.5:1.5 mol/mol) underwent degradation at a rate of 20% per hour on incubation in 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS). In contrast, the mRNA encapsulated in LNPs containing 40% ESM (ESM/MC3/Chol/PEG-lipid 40:33:25.5:1.5 mol/mol) only exhibited appreciable degradation at the 24 and 48 h time points indicating a degradation rate as low as 5% per hour. \n\nLNP mRNA systems containing 40 mol % ESM exhibit longer circulation lifetimes and increased extrahepatic distribution following i.v.",

            "text": ", in 2005, Drs. Kariko and Weissman found an effective way to evade the innate immune response by modifying the mRNA's nucleosides [4]. This major breakthrough completely altered the pharmaceutical potential of mRNA therapies and resulted in substantial investment in associated research, leading to important discoveries in mRNA modification and purification to reduce the innate immune response and improve mRNA stability.\n\nThe challenge for effective application of mRNA vaccines lies in the delivery at both the micro and macro levels. Naked mRNA is rapidly degraded by extracellular RNases, it can be immunogenic, and alone, it cannot penetrate cell membranes to be transcribed in the cytosol. Thus, intracellular delivery is essential to facilitate cellular uptake of mRNA and to protect it from RNase degradation. To date, numerous delivery methods have been developed, including ex vivo loading of dendritic cells, physical delivery methods, cationic peptide protamine, and cationic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivery, among which LNPs seems to be the most appealing and commonly used tool [2]. LNPs often consists of four components: (1) cationic or ionizable lipids, smart macromolecules that can be functionalized to improve the entrapment of mRNA, to increase cellular uptake efficiency, and promote endosomal escape; (2) lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is used for reducing particle sizes, preventing particle aggregation, increasing circulation time and reducing uptake by untargeted cells; (3) cholesterol that stabilizes LNPs complexes; and (4) phospholipids, which support lipid bilayer structure [2]. Although each of the LNPs' components has been under intensive study for LNPs delivery optimization using different formulation expertise, challenges, such as inefficient transfection and nonspecific targeting, remain for bringing the full potential of mRNA vaccines into play. Continuing research into diverse delivery platforms is still a priority to guide the development and optimization of intraellular delivery systems.\n\nThe authorization of mRNA vaccines for use is only the first of many steps to achieving effective application and success in battling the current pandemic.

            "text": "In a recent study, Mildner et al., demonstrated AF4 with the frit-inlet channel was well-suited for the analysis of lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery with satisfactory reproducibility and sample recovery [39]. Downstream characterization by multi-detectors would benefit from the high sample recovery from AF4 separation, which makes AF4 become compliant with ISO/TS 21362:2018 (nanotechnologies-analysis of nano-objects, using asymmetrical-flow and centrifugal fieldflow fractionation), resulting in better alignment with orthogonal techniques. As shown in Figure 3, particle concentration from MALS following the AF4 separation agrees well with batch NTA characterization. Nevertheless, AF4-MALS provides data across a wider radius distribution compared to batch characterization techniques. It has been shown that the in vivo potency and tissue-penetration ability of LNPs are related to particle size [91]. Researchers from Merck & CO. enabled the online determination of the size-dependent RNA content in LNPs, which was validated through RNA quantitation using a reserved-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) assay performed on individual size fractions [92]. This study involved an optimized MD-AF4 analysis with a patented UV scattering correction approach, which eliminates overestimation of UV absorption at 260 nm caused by the scattering of LNPs. Figure 4A demonstrates the significant contribution of UV scattering to the apparent absorption of 260 nm light for unloaded LNPs with no chromophore. Interestingly, after UV scattering was removed using the correction algorithm, the calculated RNA weight percentages for four different LNP formulations were found to be in excellent agreement with the data obtained by offline RPLC analysis of collected AF4 fractions. Figure 4B demonstrated the distribution of RNA content for one LNP formulation (LNP-2) using both online and offline approaches. The authors envisioned the potential for this application in QC environment to evaluate the total RNA content in LNPs within a specified size range, which is one of the critical quality attributes for RNA-LNP products. Total particle/mL concentration and radius are reported in the table in the graph. Reprinted from Ref. [39] with permission from Elsevier.",

            "text": "LNPs are the only FDA-approved carriers for mRNA vaccines, ranging from 70 to 200 nm in size. They are crucial for encapsulating and stabilizing mRNA molecules, facilitating their effective delivery into target cells (Li et al., 2022a). The structural composition of LNPs, typically including lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Hald Albertsen et al., 2022), directly influences their efficiency and efficacy. Key structural features, including lipid headgroup interactions and the arrangement of hydrophobic tails, play a critical role in the ability of LNPs to fuse with cell membranes and effectively deliver mRNA payloads. Designing and optimizing LNPs for mRNA cancer vaccines demands advanced computational tools capable of modeling and visualizing these complex structures and interactions. Tools such as NANOdesign, POLYVIEW-3D, and PyMOL are indispensable in this process. Figure 4 depicts the various sections of the mRNA-LNP complex that must be designed, optimized, and characterized using these bioinformatics tools. This figure highlights how these tools contribute to achieving stable, functional, and highly efficient mRNA-LNP formulations, addressing aspects from pharmacology to pharmaceutical applications. By utilizing these resources, researchers can fine-tune parameters such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface properties to improve the performance and stability of LNPs in mRNA cancer vaccines.",

            "text": "The siRNA-LNPs formulation of Onpattro (Patisaran) has a shelf life of three years at 2-8 \u2022 C [26]. Research by Ball et al. using ionizable cationic lipid 306O 13 as a replacement for DLin-MC3-DMA in the formulation indicates that, under aqueous conditions, the formulation remains stable for 156 days at 2 \u2022 C and pH 7, with no significant changes in particle size or siRNA encapsulation efficiency [13]. This suggests that the stability of mRNA, rather than LNPs, determines the storage conditions and shelf life of mRNA-LNP vaccines. The method of lipid encapsulation of nucleic acids not only determines the degree of protection against nucleic acid degradation but also influences how the nucleic acids escape from endosomes following the fusion of nanoparticles with the endosomal membrane. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron microscopy (EM) experiments reveal that LNPs exhibit varying numbers of layered structures, with lipid bilayers separated by acid-rich regions [27][28][29]. The internal composition of LNPs is predominantly lipid, although some research data suggest the presence of a certain degree of water [27]. This implies that, even when mRNA is encapsulated, it may still be partially exposed to the aqueous environment. This conclusion is supported not only by previous low-temperature transmission electron microscopy results of siRNA-LNPs [30], but also by similar observations of electron-dense cores in mRNA-LNPs [4]. \n\nIn recent years, although extensive research has been conducted on mRNA-LNPs (lipid nanoparticles), two important scientific issues remain unresolved. For instance, the composition and structure of mRNA-LNPs are still a matter of debate, and the encapsulation mechanism of mRNA is not yet fully understood. Investigating the microscopic dynamics during the preparation of mRNA-LNPs can aid in the optimization of lipid nanoparticle formulations and improve mRNA delivery efficiency.",

            "text": "RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines represent a novel and expanding class of medicines that have been invaluable during the coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic. The global deployment of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was a prominent milestone for those modalities, building confidence in mRNA research and further substantiating investigations of other mRNA-based medicines, such as enzyme replacement and enhanced cell therapies (Damase et al., 2021). The success of these mRNA therapies depends on their encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), assisting in the transport of exogenous nucleic acids to tissues while simultaneously preventing degradation by endo-and exonucleases (Guevara et al., 2020;Hou et al., 2021). Lipid nanoparticles are noncovalent assemblies of multiple molecular components and are typically composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized lipids (Lee et al., 2013;Hassett et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2021).It has been established that xenobiotic components, such as PEG-functionalized and ionizable lipids stabilize LNP formulation throughout manufacturing and storage, assist in cell surface binding, cellular uptake, and facilitate mRNA endosomal escape (Chan et al., 2012;Shi et al., 2021;Kalyanram et al., 2022). However, studies that assess the in vivo fates of LNP-mRNA formulations have focused on the mRNA distribution, and only to a much lesser extent, the biodistribution and clearance of LNP components and their metabolites (Hou et al., 2021). A comprehensive analysis to evaluate the biodistribution and clearance of both the mRNA and LNP constituents is crucial to fully assess the safety and efficacy of these components in both preclinical and clinical settings and inform the continued development of improved mRNA-LNP based medicines.\n\nAs studies into LNP formulations continue, emerging evidence suggests that LNPs have the potential for organ-and tissue-specific tropism of mRNA-based medicines (Rostami et al., 2014;Veiga et al.",

            "text": "The progress in establishing stable LNPs is still in its early phases and entails various challenges to produce commercial products that incorporate LNPs. The stability profile of LNPs can be assessed by measuring the particle size, PDI, ZP, %EE and drug release profile over different storage periods as per the ICH guidelines [94]. The experience of formulating therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, can be helpful in predicting potential issues that may occur during the preparation of LNPs for RNA delivery. This knowledge can assist in anticipating challenges related to the chemical stability of the LNP components, the physical stability of the LNP (such as disintegration, aggregation, and adsorption on surfaces), and the stability of RNA within the LNP, which can help us gain a better understanding of LNP preparation and enhance the delivery of RNA therapeutics. SLN stability is primarily determined by the type of lipid material used, the concentration of surfactant, and the optimization of temperature during preparation, making these parameters a critical factor to be considered to ensure proper stability and storage [95]. Synthetic nanoparticle studies conducted in aqueous solutions have revealed that several interactions between nanoparticles and co-solutes are foreseeable. These interactions are affected by the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles, which, in turn, causes diverse behaviors in the effect of salts on the solubility of the nanoparticles [96]. The significance of lipid-based formulations in solving solubility and enhancing the bioavailability of drugs cannot be overstated. However, there is a noticeable challenge regarding lipid excipient chemistry and its performance, particularly concerning oxidative stability. Antioxidants have been utilized to preserve the stability of pharmaceutical products by either intervening chemically in crucial oxidative phases, preventing the onset of reactions, or by markedly reducing oxidative reaction rates. This maintains the integrity of the dosage form and ensures the stability of the drugs. Chelating agents have the potential to serve as an initial protective measure against oxidation initiated by metals.",

            "text": "Our research demonstrates that low-cost microfluidic mixers can reliably produce LNPs, highlighting their potential as effective tools for affordable small-scale production and high-throughput screening applications. We evaluated three mixing methods: TM, IJM, and PM. While PM may lack precise control over CPPs and is not scalable, it proved effective for small-scale LNP manufacture. Characterization studies showed that CQAs were influenced more by payload (Figure 2) than the mixing method (Figures 3-8); for example, poly A yielded smaller LNPs with higher encapsulation efficiencies, whereas mRNA constructs increased particle size. This is likely because poly A is a small, linear molecule compared to mRNA, which can exhibit enhanced secondary structures that may lead to a less tightly packed LNP structure. Cy5-Fluc mRNA also increased the LNP size, possibly due to interactions with the fluorescent tag and lipid components. \n\nWe also observed a decrease in encapsulation for LNPs containing Cy5-Fluc (Figure 2), possibly due to the Cy5-tag interfering with the RiboGreen assay. Specifically, Cy5 has an excitation/emission spectrum of approximately 650/670 nm, while Ribogreen operates at approximately 500/525 nm; this spectral overlap suggests that Cy5 has the potential to fluorescently quench the RiboGreen signal, thereby affecting the fluorescence readout. To mitigate this effect, Cy5-Fluc mRNA was used during the assay to build the calibration curves. While not fully quantified in this study, this potential interference should be considered when interpreting encapsulation data involving fluorescently labelled RNA. Fluorescent tags, particularly cyanine dyes, are widely used in LNP and liposomal research and generally do not significantly affect particle characteristics [20]. For example, Ma et al. investigated in vivo mRNA delivery using SM-102-LNPs tagged with Cy5 and DiR, reporting sizes around 100 nm [21]. However, their LNPs were produced at a higher flow rate and purified via dialysis. In contrast, we used spin column purification in our studies, introducing a rapid pH change and high centrifugal forces that may contribute to these differences.",

            "text": "For example, one challenge with mRNA products is their sensitivity to degradation by RNases, so proper protection against the introduction of adventitious RNases should be ensured. In addition, mixing of the components at acidic pH is a fundamental step in the standard LNP formulation process that cannot be circumvented, because a charge on the ionizable lipid is required for complexation of the cargo. However, changing parameters such as pH, ionic strength, holding time at low pH, temperature and light exposure during processing can still have a big impact on the formation of impurities even before storage. \n\nWhat Challenges Remain en route to Thermostable mRNA Drug Products? \n\nWith few exceptions, vaccines and therapeutic candidates based on IVT-transcribed mRNA are, at present, complex assemblies of the nucleic acid and lipid compounds that form nanoparticles. As such, the stability of these mRNA-based drug products on storage remains a challenge for three main reasons: 1) mRNA is not an intrinsically stable molecule, 2) lipid components required for delivery must be essentially free of impurities that can induce mRNA degradation, and 3) the physical stability of mRNA-LNP complexes is precarious, and sensitive to handling and thermal effects. \n\nOne of the key stabilization strategies in active development for formulated mRNA drug products to be stored in the refrigerator is lyophilization. This is logical, given the success of this dehydration approach with other biological products including other vaccines. 155,156 Overcoming the cryo-and lyo-induced particle degradation effects is a key goal to be tackled to make freeze-dried mRNAs formulated in LNPs successful product candidates. If these hurdles can be addressed, then the prospects for leaving the freezer for longterm storage look promising. An example of an mRNA-LNP product currently in a Phase 3 trial as a lyophilized product is Moderna's CMV vaccine. 157 However, the worldwide capacity for production of lyophilized products is limited. Therefore, such an approach has limited utility for certain therapeutic applications, for example, mRNA vaccines that require billions of doses to be produced per year for global use. \n\nPackaging approaches including selection of the primary container to preserve the formulated mRNA DP integrity and increase ease of use are future targets for improvements.",

            "text": "Both studies were conducted on the dental pulp of pigs, in the first case, and on human volunteers who underwent orthodontic intervention, in the second case. Young S.T. et al. [25] analyzed the timing of the degradation of two \u03b2-actin fragments, PBA301, which is the larger and labile segment, and PBA71, which is the smaller and more stable non-overlapping segment. The smaller fragment proved to be more stable and, therefore, more reliable in the case of longer time intervals. Poor V.S. et al. [32] instead proposed the evaluation of \u03b2-actin mRNA degradation using two different methods: the RNA Integrity Number and qRT-PCR. RIN is a numerical assessment used to evaluate the integrity and quality of RNA samples, ranging from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating better RNA integrity and quality [61]. Conversely, qRT-PCR quantifies the expression levels of specific mRNA targets [48]. The evaluation of the RIN allowed us to obtain statistically significant values within the first 21 days, while the qRT-PCR analysis, subsequently performed on three fragments of different sizes (800, 400, and 200 base pairs), allowed us to extend the time frame of PMI estimation to an interval between 20 and 42 days after extraction. Therefore, the simultaneous use of different methods can increase the accuracy of the analysis. Alshehhi S. et al. [40] also proposed the use of mRNA molecules for the evaluation of intermediate-long PMIs. The analysis of STATH mRNA on saliva and PRM1 mRNA and PRM2 mRNA on sperm proved the usefulness of STATH mRNA for up to 28 days and PRM1 and PRM2 mRNA for up to 90 days. \n\nTherefore, the same type of RNA (mRNA) or even the same molecule, such as \u03b2actin and GAPDH mRNA, are capable of behaving differently, making them potentially useful in very different time intervals, ranging from a few hours to several weeks or months [23,32,40].",

            "text": "LNPs are used as the delivery system in mRNA vaccines [93][94][95]. For novel excipients (e.g. cationic lipids), detailed information on the production process and quality control, including raw materials and intermediates, should be provided where possible. A detailed characterization of the LNPs should be performed, as well as a specific description of any formulation features that may affect the vaccine's quality, safety and efficacy, the impacts of which should be considered in the formulation development process [96]. The proportion of ionizable lipids in LNP lipid compositions affects the encapsulation rate of the mRNA vaccine and the nanoparticle selfassembly process; lipid species, the charge of the headgroup, and the hydrophobicity of the tail affect the particle size, morphology, and stability of the mRNA vaccine [97]. \n\nThe use of HPLC equipped with a CAD for qualitative and quantitative detection of lipid components in mRNA vaccines has been added to the second edition of the 'Analytical Procedures for mRNA Vaccine Quality -Draft Guidelines' issued by the USP [55]. Ionizable cationic lipids in mRNA vaccines have been shown to activate the innate immune response and act as vaccine adjuvants. Cholesterol may also activate the innate immune response and act as a vaccine adjuvant, so it is necessary to investigate and elucidate biological functions in mRNA vaccines and to establish quality standards with respect to these functions [98]. Some studies have reported that the presence of water in the inner core of the LNP affects the storage stability of mRNA vaccines, the amount of which is mainly related to the lipid composition and the internal structure after assembly with mRNA [91].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have revolutionized nucleic acid delivery, enabling significant advances in mRNA-based therapeutics. While extensive research has focused on lipid composition, the impact of preparation solutions on LNP performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigated the effects of pH, salt type, and concentration across key preparation solutions\u2014mRNA aqueous, dilution, exchange, and storage solutions\u2014on the physicochemical properties, stability, and expression efficiency of SM102-based mRNA/LNPs. Findings revealed that the pH of the mRNA aqueous solution was critical, with a pH of 4 optimizing encapsulation efficiency (EE) and cellular expression. The exchange solution\u2019s pH significantly influenced biodistribution, particularly liver-specific expression following intravenous and intramuscular administration. Sucrose was identified as essential for freeze-thaw stability, with a 300 mM concentration minimizing aggregation and mRNA leakage. Furthermore, preparation solutions were shown to influence the structural integrity of LNPs, impacting their in vivo and in vitro performance. These insights highlight the importance of preparation conditions in optimizing LNP formulations for clinical applications, offering a foundation for enhanced therapeutic design and delivery.

            "text": "The above UV\u2212vis analysis shows that LNPs dissolve in ethanol solutions and in the presence of common detergent solutions (e.g., SDS). However, in order to use LNPs for the validation of disinfection procedures, UV\u2212vis is not a very practical method to determine the intactness of a LNP sample. First, the sensitivity of UV\u2212vis is low (>1 mg/mL concentrations required), and the UV\u2212vis reading of a sample of unknown concentration cannot be used to determine whether the LNPs have been dissolved or whether the LNPs have merely been diluted. These shortcomings can be overcome by using DNA amplicons encapsulated within the LNPs as quantification tools: DNA can be quantified to extreme sensitivities (down to a single-molecule level), 24 and the enzymatic assay presented further above should be able to assess the integrity of the LNPs within a given sample. \n\nTo test the performance of such a procedure, a surface test was conducted (Figure 5). The as-prepared LNPs carrying a short DNA amplicon were deposited on a glass surface (50 \u03bcL/0.005 ng/\u03bcL). The LNPs were allowed to dry (2 h), and the surface was subsequently treated through wiping with a tissue moistened with either water, 70 v % ethanol, or an aqueous detergent solution (SDS, 5 g/L). A sample was then taken from the surface by pipetting 200 \u03bcL of MilliQ to the surface to rewet and collect the nanoparticles. The total amount of DNA in these samples was measured by qPCR (reading A). Thereby, any diluting (wiping away) of LNPs from the surface can be measured by comparison with the qPCR reading of an untreated sample (no wiping = control reading). Experimental data (Figure 6) show that a comparable amount of LNPs was removed from the surfaces, irrespective of the composition of the wiping solution. In detail, prior to wiping, the qPCR reading was ca. 10 Ct, which was increased to ca. 19 Ct after the wiping.",

            "text": "Furthermore, it is often most informative to test the mRNA in conjunction with its delivery vehicle as this provides a more comprehensive understanding of its functionality in a biological system. Consequently, using cellular assays is generally preferred as they allow for a more accurate assessment of mRNA expression and functionality within the context of its intended delivery and application. \n\nFor mRNA vaccines the functionality is defined as the faithful translation of a single or series of antigens by the ribosomes. This is best done in the context of a cell with an mRNA delivered in its clinical formulation. For example, Patel et al. reported the development of an imaging-based in vitro assay capable of quantifying transgene protein expression efficiency, which is useful for measuring LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine potency, efficacy, and stability [125]. More recently, Q. Stiving et al. developed a platform-based, antibody-free method using cell-free translation and LC-MS/MS to detect, characterize, and provide relative quantification of antigen proteins translated from mRNA vaccine (mRNA encoding different antigen variants) [126]. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were successfully demonstrated by identifying all six translated proteins and their relative abundances in a dose-dependent manner following the transfection of human cells with a hexavalent mRNA mixture encapsulated in LNPs. \n\nThe primary function of an mRNA is to carry the code needed to direct the translation of a specific protein. This can be assessed independently of that protein's activity. However, testing the functionality of the encoded protein is also critical as it verifies whether the mRNA sequence is adequately designed to produce the intended protein capable of performing its specific function. This adds complexity to the analysis as each protein requires an assay designed to evaluate its specific function. Genome editing using mRNAs encoding TALEN, ZFN, and Cas9 is a perfect example where the approach is to test the functionality of the genome-engineering enzyme [127]. This involves using mRNA that expresses the enzyme in gene-editing experiments. Scientists transfect cells with Cas9 mRNA and specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) that direct Cas9 to targeted genomic loci.",

[45] The initial mRNA amount used for the formulation was retrievable, indicating no loss of mRNA during the preparation or storage of the LNPs. These results support our proposed formulation procedure, as mRNA is susceptible to degradation by various mechanisms but here protected via the LNP formulations. [46] With increasing PEtOx chain length, the EE decreased, resulting in PEtOx 18 LNPs encapsulating the highest amount of mRNA with a comparable EE to the PEG LNPs (Figure 4A). \n\nThe biocompatibility of the novel PEtOx LNPs was assessed through a cytotoxicity screening, in accordance with the international guidelines (ISO 10993-5).

All LNPs have been tested until a total molar lipid concentration of 500 \u03bcmol L \u22121 , and no toxic effects were detected in the indicated range (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Furthermore, no significant differences in the cytotoxicity were detected between the PEG LNP and the PEtOx LNPs, highlighting the potential of PEtOx as a viable alternative for LNP formulations. These findings suggest that PEtOx LNPs exhibit favorable biocompatibility, supporting their suitability for further biological investigations, since a high biocompatibility underlines the safety profile of novel and innovative drugs. [6]  major problem with conventional LNPs containing PEG is their potential for side effects and increasing body clearance induced by anti-PEG antibodies. To ensure that the PEG analogues will not induce a possible reaction with these antibodies, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed. Since it was revealed in studies that anti-PEG antibodies can specifically bind to the PEG backbone, a PEGylated protein ELISA kit containing an antibody specific to the backbone of PEG was used.

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding therapeutic proteins has recently demonstrated its potential to treat a variety of diseases in preclinical and clinical studies [1,2]. For in vivo mRNA delivery, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used to prevent mRNA degradation before translating proteins in target cells, and exhibit promising outcome especially in mRNA delivery to the liver and the spleen, owing to their intrinsic tropism to these organs [3][4][5]. On the other hand, a critical issue for the widespread clinical application of LNPs is the complicated procedures for their formulation. The main reason for such intricate processes is the uncontrollable aggregation of cationic lipids with large and highly charged anionic molecules, such mRNA, resulting after directly mixing these components, as extensively demonstrated for LNPs loading plasmid DNA (pDNA) [6]. Thus, the preparation of uniform nanometer-sized mRNA-loaded LNPs often requires special devices or techniques, such as microfluidics, for mixing the lipid components and mRNA, which allows controlling the size of LNPs [7,8] and replacing organic solvents with buffers for biological usage [9,10]. On the other hand, the development of a simple and scalable technique capable of preventing such aggregate formation in buffer would be highly valuable for the straightforward formulation of clinically relevant mRNA-loaded LNPs. \n\nHerein, we proposed a simple yet robust and versatile strategy of LNP preparation by installing polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the mRNA molecules. The steric repulsive forces between PEG chains are expected to prevent LNP aggregation after mixing parent LNPs with mRNA. Besides the undemanding assembly, this strategy would allow easy preparation of mRNA-loaded LNPs in bedside just by mixing two aqueous solutions of LNPs and mRNA, without the need of special devices and buffer replacement, as well as eliminating long-term storage of mRNA-loaded LNPs in aqueous solution, which is often challenging. Moreover, the LNPs resulting from the proposed method are PEGylated, which contributes to LNP steric stabilization under biological milieu [11,12].",

Microfluidic devices are anticipated to create LNPs for medicinal and vaccination purposes, increasing their frequency as technology advances. The loading of mRNA into LNPs is accomplished through microfluidics, which involves precise control of the mixing of mRNA and LNP components and results in proper containment of the mRNA within the LNPs. Additionally, microfluidic enables the creation of LNPs with a homogenous size distribution, which is crucial for their effective delivery of mRNA into cells [90,91]. The typical procedure for preparing mRNA-loaded LNPs involves dissolving mRNA in a low pH aqueous buffer (pH~4.0) and microfluidically mixing it with an ethanolic solution of hydrophobic lipids to form stable LNPs with low polydispersity index. These LNPs initially contain 25-50% ethanol and have a low pH; thus, they require further dialysis and buffer exchange using tangential flow filtration (TFF) to obtain the final bulk product [18,78]. This product can be sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 \u00b5m sterile grade filter and then filled into aseptic containers. The finished drug product can be in either a lyophilized or direct fill-finish format [92].",

Furthermore, mRNA-LNP vaccines target different biological pathways to siRNA-LNP which are aimed at gene silencing [ 29 ]. Indeed, formulations optimized for siRNA delivery [118] or even pDNA delivery [119] have demonstrated poor performance when provided with an mRNA cargo, necessitating optimization of formulations towards effective encapsulation and delivery of antigen-encoding mRNA, towards establishing a new class of nanovaccines [ 120 ].\n\nThe most typical lipid composition utilized for mRNA-LNP systems consists of a cationic/ionizable lipid, a phospholipid 'helper lipid', cholesterol and/or a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipid. The ratios of these components are varied based on the desired target tissue; physicochemical attributes such as particle size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and outer surface charge within the LNP delivery system can be facilely modulated via tuning the lipid composition [ 121 ].",

Here, only mRNA integrity decreased without any significant change in mRNA concentration and encapsulation efficiency, which were quantified by RiboGreen assay using fluorescent dyes ( Figures S5B and S5C), suggesting that mRNA was degrading inside the nanoparticles.\n\nFinally, samples stored for 1 month were immunized intramuscularly once in mice, and their plasmas were evaluated for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific binding IgG on day 14 ( Figure 2E).

            "text": "Through the design of orthogonal experiments, researchers can determine the optimal LNP formulation by preparing LNPs with different substance ratios, ensuring that changes in targeted delivery are not driven by specific ratios of the four components.This allows to produce large-scale LNPs with different chemical structures.These LNPs formed with different formulations are usually characterized and screened for physicochemical properties in vitro or ex vivo environments.This can be determined through methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and chromatography to assess the impact of different components on physicochemical properties, including LNP size, zeta potential, pKa, mRNA encapsulation efficiency, etc.for initial screening, followed by subsequent targeted analysis and screening.\n\nTherefore, HTS techniques could be combined with various experimental methods to observe in vitro cellular protein expression, and the delivery of LNPs to target organs and cells through in vitro and in vivo screening experiments.This will ultimately determine the optimal novel LNP structure to enhance mRNA delivery targeting.In vitro screening, these LNPs are typically first used to deliver luciferase mRNA or Cre recombinase mRNA to immortalized cell lines (such as Hela cells, 293T cells, etc.) to reflect the cell transfection efficiency and intracellular mRNA translation ability of this delivery method, as well as the ability of LNPs to escape endosomal membranes within cells, promote mRNA release and translation, and assess the corresponding cell toxicity.Subsequently, for the validation of cell targeting, LNPs are used to transfect cell lines that simulate the corresponding tissue microenvironment in vitro, and the delivery efficiency is also assessed through in vitro luciferase assay.For instance, researchers used an LNP library to transfect B16F10, CT26, and Raw264.7 cells (representing epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages, respectively) and identified macrophage cell-type-specific lipids by evaluating mRNA delivery [67].However, most of the time, in vitro screening cannot fully replicate the influence of the in vivo-specific biological barriers affecting LNPs, making the ability to predict in vivo biodistribution and efficacy less accurate.",

            "text": "Finally, DOPE-C8-LNPs, which were initially characterized as potent DOPE-Cx-LNPs, were characterized. The mRNA con-centration after incubation with freshly obtained mouse serum was measured to determine the stability of the DOPE-C8-LNPs (Figure 6A). Naked mRNA exposed to serum could hardly be detected, which indicates the instability of mRNA in biological fluid. On the other hand, mRNA encapsulated in the DOPE-Cx-LNPs was fully protected from enzymatic degradation for up to 2 h, which suggests the efficient encapsulation and high stability of the formulation. Next, the remaining mRNA in liver after intravenous injection was compared between DOPE-C8-LNPs and DSPC-LNPs (Figure 6B). The DOPE-C8-LNPs showed a twofold higher level of mRNA, which indicates a more efficient cytosolic delivery of mRNA due to the fact that the hepatic accumulation level between the two LNPs was consistent. These findings suggest that the DOPE-C8-LNPs stably protect and deliver mRNAs to the site of action in a more efficacious manner compared with that of the original formulation. \n\nThe long-term accumulation of ionizable lipids is known to be toxic. These compounds interact with negatively charged lipids and induce either membrane fusion or disruption. There is reasonable concern that toxicity also is induced by the long-term accumulation of DOPE-C8, which induces a cubic phase following interaction with PCs. Therefore, DOPE-C8 concentrations in the liver after intravenous injection were quantified via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) (Figure 6C). The DOPE-C8 was rapidly eliminated and reached the lower limit of detection after 24 h. The initial (0.5-4 h) elimination half-life was calculated to be 1.83 h. No metabolites of the DOPE-C8 could be detected in the liver.",

The automated data analysis enabled rapid verification of the long RNA sequences from complex oligoribonuceotide LC MS/MS data sets. Furthermore, high sequence coverage with no or low sequence matches against random control RNA sequences was obtained, demonstrating the specificity of the analytical workflow in conjucntion with the parameters used for RNA sequence mapping. mRNA therapeutics have emerged as a new important class of therapeutic and require the development of new analytical methods to analyse mRNA critical quality attributes and confirm identity. Direct sequencing of the mRNA is now possible in a simple automated workflow using this new approach. The analytical workflow, including automated sample preparation can be completed within 90 minutes. Simple partial RNase T1 digestion with LC MS/MS analysis and automated data analysis offers a rapid, high throughput method for the analysis of mRNA therapeutics and the ability to analyse important mRNA critical quality attributes including RNA sequence integrity and RNA sequence identity. Furthermore, the same workflow can be used for sequence mapping of chemically modified mRNA and to identify impurities present in the mRNA.

Intriguingly, mRNA-LNPs are known to form both spherical and highly nonspherical morphologies (9,11,16,18,19), but the origins and practical implications of these morphological variants SIGNIFICANCE The clinical utility of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines delivered in lipid nanoparticles has recently been highlighted by their use in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). The lipid nanoparticle is a complex entity in terms of structural and physical attributes that influence biological efficacy and pharmaceutics. One of the most fundamental yet elusive questions has been the nature and location of the mRNA payload inside the lipid nanoparticle. Elucidating this detail via direct experimental methods has been a major objective in the field of RNA delivery. Here, we show that a combination of dye-binding and cryo-electron microscopy pinpoints the mRNA location, providing new insights into its encapsulation state and chemical microenvironment. remain unclear. Molecular simulation studies (20) indicate that the LNP structure may involve solvent pockets, and experimental studies have shown nonspherical morphologies to be associated with segregation of the bilayer-forming 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) component, resulting in pronounced blebs (11). Despite significant efforts to pinpoint the nucleic acid payload, the precise location of mRNA molecules within LNPs has not heretofore been unambiguously identified via direct experimental methods.\n\nOne difficulty with the analysis of LNPs is that many biophysical techniques produce a globally averaged signal or have limited selectivity for the RNA molecule within the solid particle. Although cryo-EM is a powerful tool for visualizing LNPs, the mass density contrast alone is not distinctive enough to unambiguously resolve RNA from lipidic components. To overcome these limitations, we explored the concept of using an RNA-binding dye to",

In this case, 15 \u00b5L of beads per sample was washed with binding buffer (2) and resuspended in 30 \u00b5L of 2x bead buffer. Samples were made up to 30 \u00b5L and heated to 65 \u2022 C for 5 min to remove any secondary structure. Samples were mixed with the beads on a rotator for 5 min at room temperature. After collecting the beads on a Magnetic Particle Concentrator (MPC), the beads were washed twice with wash buffer, with removal of all traces after each wash step. Twelve microliters of water were added to the beads for elution, which was achieved by heating the sample at 70 \u2022 C for 2 min and retrieving the supernatant containing the RNA.

            "text": "LIPID NANOPARTICLES FOR MRNA DELIVERY Due to their size, polyanionic nature, and hydrophilicity, the intracellular delivery of mRNA molecules cannot generally rely on passive diffusion across cell membranes. Furthermore, nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by endogenous nucleases in physiological fluids. To overcome these challenges, LNPs incorporating ionizable lipids have been developed as delivery vehicles for siRNA and mRNA, serving both to protect the delicate cargo from degradation in vivo and to enable delivery into the cell. LNPs for mRNA delivery generally comprise a zwitterionic phospholipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, and an ionizable lipid. 45,46 Engineering the lipid structure 47 and particle surface has thus been pursued as a strategy to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape 48,49 while specific nanostructural features of the LNP, such as nonlamellar lipid phases, have also been suggested to affect delivery efficiency. 50 LNP interfacial interactions with the cell membrane initiate the internalization of the mRNA; then, inside the cell, the more acidic environment protonates the ionizable lipid, reversing the electrostatic interactions to release the RNA cargo for translation and subsequent protein expression. This is of course an oversimplified description, and the reader is directed to some excellent recent reviews that address these intracellular aspects in more detail. 45,51 The LNP morphology, lipid packing, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA are thus plausibly connected to the delivery efficiency, emphasizing the central significance of higher-order structure associated with both the mRNA and LNP. \n\nThe challenges of LNP preparative scale-up and large-scale processing represent another interesting point of distinction between mRNA-vaccines and biologic drugs. While LNPs may be prepared at bench-scale using pipets and simple manual mixing, 52 their cGMP scale-up for clinical/commercial use employs finely controllable rapid-mixing platforms involving multiple processing steps. 53,54 In contrast, the large-scale production of many biologic drugs can be based on relatively simple thaw\u2212filter\u2212fill drug product production processes.",

Some providers recently commercialized SEC columns with 1000 and 2000 \u00c5 nominal pore diameters; however, inertness of the packing material and column hardware is also important to limit the loss of nucleic acids on metal surfaces in liquid chromatography. 19 Thus, there is an unmet need to develop new columns capable of separating these large species. \n\nIn this work, prototype ultrawide pore size SEC columns were investigated for their utility to separate ultralarge nucleic acids and their size variants. Studies were first performed in order to investigate the column's physiochemical properties before assessing their metrics with DP applications. A heat treatment of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNAs obtained from two commercial vendors was performed. The purity differences between the samples, characterized as the quantity and type of aggregates, was determined. Next, the thermal degradation of a 3.2 kilobase pairs (kbps) pDNA was evaluated using SEC and compared to an in-house AEC method. Finally, the SEC column was used to characterize a series of LNP formulations. The elution times of various LNPs were plotted against their sizes as determined by DLS. Coupling multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractometer (dRI) to SEC provided in-depth sizing and geometry information that enabled us to make insights into the order of the self-assembled species. \n\n\u25a0 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Chemicals.

            "text": "While there are a handful of methods to characterize encapsulation efficiency of an LNP formulation for its cargo, modified RiboGreen assay is by far the most common [25][26][27][28][29][30] . RiboGreen is a dye developed for quantitation of RNA in which fluorescence is produced upon nucleic acid binding 31 . For determination of encapsulation efficiency in LNPs, RiboGreen is first added to the sample with LNPs intact to measure the unencapsulated RNA concentration. A detergent solution (e.g. Triton X-100) is then added to disrupt the nanoparticles, releasing encapsulated RNA, and the total amount of RNA in the sample is calculated from RiboGreen fluorescence. Encapsulated RNA is calculated by subtracting unencapsulated RNA from total RNA and encapsulation efficiency is then taken as the ratio of encapsulated RNA to total RNA in the sample. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Encapsulation efficiency (EE%), as traditionally calculated, describes the percentage of RNA in the sample that is encapsulated by LNPs. However, this ratiometric calculation does not take into consideration the amount of RNA used for the LNP synthesis, and what percentage of that input RNA is encapsulated in the final product. There are several reasons the input RNA concentration should be considered in the evaluation of encapsulation efficiency. Total RNA concentration measured in the sample, post synthesis, is not likely to match the input RNA concentration. RNA, especially shorter strands lacking secondary structure, are delicate and highly susceptible to degradation by RNases 32 . Processing steps after LNP formulation (i.e. buffer exchange, centrifugal concentration steps, etc.) may cause preferential degradation of unencapsulated (unprotected) RNA in the sample due to unintentional RNase contamination. In addition, the synthetic procedure uses microfluidic mixing where rapid flow rates produce shear stress, which may cause mechanical degradation of RNA. This will also decrease the amount of RNA in the sample. These degradation mechanisms will artificially increase encapsulation efficiency by decreasing the unencapsulated RNA concentration.",

            "text": "Using DynaPro, the total number of nanoparticles was measured at a constant mRNA concentration of 0.01 mg/mL (except for B-DOPE F1, which was diluted further by 100fold) for all of the parents and fractions. As shown in Figure 5E, the F1 of both A-DOPE and A-DEPE had significantly higher number of particles than the respective parents and other fractions (p < 0.005). Of note, the particle numbers/mL for the lipid-rich F1 of the B-DOPE formulation were almost an order of magnitude higher than the parent formulation (Figure 5F). Since the particle count measurements were normalized to the total mRNA, it was demonstrably evident that this topmost fraction of B-DOPE LNPs had a higher number of \"empty\" LNPs, supported by the lipid quantification and Ribogreen results, which showed the highest lipid content and the lowest mRNA content for this fraction, respectively. Independent studies have also demonstrated the presence of 40\u221280% empty LNPs in various types of formulations, including MC3 industry standard. 19,31 Although we were not able to further resolve F1 to quantify the exact number of empty LNPs, the true \"LNP heterogeneity\" would be determined not only by the differences in individual fractions but also by the percent of that fraction within the total formulation. Thus, in the context of biological function, for the same amount of mRNA, a considerably higher amount of lipids was co-dosed for the F1 B-DOPE, resulting in significantly higher IV hEPO expression, and the lower amount of lipids codosed for F3 led to lower protein production, compared to the parent formulation. \n\nNo significant correlation was found between the positive zeta potential of the four parent LNPs (Figure 5G,H). Among the fractions, the zeta potential decreased significantly from F1 to F3 for DOPE-based LNPs and from F1 to F2 for B-DEPE LNPs. In general, the surface charge of the topmost fraction for all the LNPs tended to correlate with their lipid content, particle count, and in vivo functionality (more so for the IV route).",

Previous reports suggested that, among potential mRNA degradation pathways, hydrolysis plays a major role in mRNA stability. 20,24 We, therefore, hypothesized that the removal of water by lyophilization improves storage stability. We first screened for buffer solutions that could protect LNPs from potential damage during the freeze-dry-ing process, where sucrose was selected as a cryoprotectant. The concentration of sucrose in the solution varied (0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% w/v) with 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5. LNP formulations were lyophilized using a lyophilizer. The lyophilization cycle consisted of a freezing step at \u00c040 C for 4 h under vacuum, a primary drying step at \u00c040 C for 45 h under vacuum ($3 Pa), and a secondary drying step at +10 C for 66 h under vacuum ($3 Pa). The pressure within the shelf was returned to atmospheric pressure using dry nitrogen to obtain lyophilized samples. A solid cake was formed after freeze-drying LNP-CoV mRNA with at least 4% sucrose, and no aggregation was observed after reconstitution with water ( Figures 2D,  S4A, and S4B). We selected a 16% sucrose formulation for further analysis because it showed the lowest increase in LNP size (from 109 to 136 nm) without aggregation and mRNA leakage ( Figure S4C).\n\nNext, to test the storage stability, we stored LNP-CoV mRNA (16% sucrose buffer) with or without lyophilization (i.e., lyophilized The representative appearance of lyophilized LNP-",

            "text": "In order to isolate high-quality RNA, the samples need to be processed immediately after harvest. If an immediate isolation is not possible, samples can be stabilized in an intermediary solution to preserve RNA integrity and allow storage. Commonly used stabilizers are RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific and Qiagen) and RNAstable (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA isolation and extraction methods can be manual (e.g., TRIzol-Thermo Fisher Scientific) or automated (e.g., RNeasy-Qiagen), and different types of samples require different approaches, although all of them comprise: (i) sample solubilization in the presence of detergent and chaotropic agents, (ii) sample homogenization for complete cell disruption and (iii) RNA recovery from the lysate with organic or solid-phase extraction. It is also important to have a final RNA free of genomic DNA (gDNA) contaminants. Some protocols can carry over some gDNA into total RNA samples that can be removed by a DNAse treatment. gDNA contamination can lead to a counting bias in downstream analysis and can be detected by reads background over the whole genome (false positive signal). Further information about sample preparation techniques and some commercial kits available can be found in Ref. [52]. Different commercial kits demonstrated satisfactory RNA yield, but differences in the quality of extracted RNA were observed, which can interfere on the downstream analysis [53]. \n\nRNA quality can be assessed by gel electrophoresis (agarose or polyacrylamide) or through Agilent Bioanalyzer. RNA quantity can be assessed using spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop), fluorometer (e.g., Qubit) or Agilent Bioanalyzer. No single RNA quantification and quality control method are ideal, and it is necessary to know the limits of each method. We recommend Bioanalyzer since it measures the RNA integrity and level of degradation by the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) score that allows sample quality comparison by a scale with a range from 1 (most degraded) to 10 (most intact) [54,55].",

The mRNA molecule within the LNP is thus expected to possess a distinct stability profile relative to naked RNA. It is worth emphasizing at this point that the term \"stability\" is often used in different scientific contexts across the pharmaceutical sciences and biological sciences fields. It has been described basically as the potential of a pattern to survive over time, 60 and in the context of a biological-based medicinal product, the relevant pattern may be categorized broadly as either conformational or compositional. Denaturation, unfolding, self-association, and aggregation relate to the former, whereas processes creating new chemical entities such as cleavage, enzymatic degradation, oxidation, and covalent adducts 12 are examples of the latter. The preservation of correct higher-order structures, specifically secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, represents a central focus of biologic product development and characterization 61 for which the close connection between conformational stability and chemical stability is well recognized. 62 Interfacial stresses associated with large-scale production, filling, shipping, storage, handling, and administration create formidable challenges to preserving these delicate higher-order structures necessary for biological activity. 63 Signatures of thermal unfolding can thus provide some basis for understanding how pharmaceutical conditions  At the far left, a spherical particle with mRNA and the lipid fully associated is depicted.

            "text": "One of the larger LNP formulations kept a constant DSPC area/molecule (1.2 nm 2 ) in the shell, while the other presented a variable DSPC surface density. These formulations were dosed to cells (adipocytes and hepatocytes) to compare their protein production ability. While the level of encapsulation of mRNA per LNP was similar in the two series of formulations, the protein expression was higher when surface area per DSPC was kept to 1.2 nm 2 in both cell lines (Figures 4a and b). Based on this result, the authors suggested that the surface composition of mRNA-LNPs is key for efficient protein production. Subsequently, using a surface-sensitive characterization technique (QCM-D), the extent of protein binding to LNPs was determined, and the binding affinities of various apolipoproteins to mRNA-LNP were ranked [39]. It was found that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) binding to mRNA LNP formulations correlated with protein expression in vitro upon mRNA-LNP dosing [6] (Figures 4b and c). The results confirmed the key role of ApoE in cellular uptake of mRNA-LNPs and the importance of the surface structure of mRNA-LNP in the binding to ApoE, as suggested earlier [6]. \n\nOther studies reported that the choice of helper lipid can affect both structure and function of the resulting LNP (Figure 4d). In particular, the use of unsaturated helper lipids instead of saturated ones in the LNP formulation resulted in higher luciferase expression in vitro, and this was linked to a larger structural remodelling upon pH decrease for the LNP containing unsaturated helper lipid than for the LNP containing DSPC [41]. The latter was quantified by the structural change in LNP taking place when changing the pH from 7.4 to 4 as measured by SANS; the so-called Euclidean distance in the structure feature space. \n\nAnother recent study shows that the type of sterol used also influences LNP structure and function [42].",

                "snippets": "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability.

The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer.

The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer.

                "snippets": "A common method to characterize the integrity of the mRNA, i.e., to measure the purity and impurity profile, is IP-RPLC-UV (ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection). 76,49 A reversed-phase stationary phase together with a mobile phase containing ion-pair reagent enables retention and separation of the negatively charged mRNA. The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating.\n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection....For the RNA quantification in LNPs, the Quant-it RiboGreen reagent (Thermofisher) characterization is widely used, because it can differentiate between RNA inside and outside the LNP to calculate a percentage encapsulated RNA, which is not straightforward with other methods. 82",

Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines were developed quickly by companies that were actively developing mRNA therapeutics and vaccines for other indications, leading to two mRNA vaccines being not only the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to be approved for emergency use but also the first mRNA drugs to gain emergency use authorization and to eventually gain full approval. This was possible partly because mRNA sequences can be altered to encode nearly any protein without significantly altering its chemical properties, allowing the drug substance to be a modular component of the drug product. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology required to protect the ribonucleic acid (RNA) and mediate delivery into the cytoplasm of cells is likewise modular, as are technologies and infrastructure required to encapsulate the RNA into the LNP. This enabled the rapid adaptation of the technology to a new target. Upon the coattails of the clinical success of mRNA vaccines, this modularity will pave the way for future RNA medicines for cancer, gene therapy, and RNA engineered cell therapies. In this review, trends in the publication records and clinical trial registrations are tallied to show the sharp intensification in preclinical and clinical research for RNA medicines. Demand for the manufacturing of both the RNA drug substance (DS) and the LNP drug product (DP) has already been strained, causing shortages of the vaccine, and the rise in development and translation of other mRNA drugs in the coming years will exacerbate this strain. To estimate demand for DP manufacturing, the dosing requirements for the preclinical and clinical studies of the two approved mRNA vaccines were examined. To understand the current state of mRNA-LNP production, current methods and technologies are reviewed, as are current and announced global capacities for commercial manufacturing. Finally, a vision is rationalized for how emerging technologies such as self-amplifying mRNA, microfluidic production, and trends toward integrated and distributed manufacturing will shape the future of RNA manufacturing and unlock the potential for an RNA medicine revolution.",
                    "[59526403 | Kanavarioti | 2019 | Citations: 66]": "Synthetic RNA oligos exhibit purity decreasing as a function of length, because the efficiency of the total synthesis is the numerical product of the individual step efficiencies, typically below 98%. Analytical methods for RNAs up to the 60 nucleotides (nt) have been reported, but they fall short for purity evaluation of 100nt long, used as single guide RNA (sgRNA) in CRISPR technology, and promoted as pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to exploit a single HPLC method and obtain both identity as well as purity, ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography (IP-RP) at high temperature in the presence of an organic cosolvent is the current analytical strategy. Here we report that IP-RP is less suitable compared to the conventional ion-exchange (IEX) for analysis of 100nt RNAs. We demonstrate the relative stability of RNA in the denaturing/basic IEX mobile phase, lay out a protocol to determine the on-the-column stability of any RNA, and establish the applicability of this method for quality testing of sgRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Unless well resolving HPLC methods are used for batch-to-batch evaluation of man-made RNAs, process development will remain shortsighted, and observed off-target effects in-vitro or in-vivo may be partially related to low purity and the presence of shorter sequences."

RiboGreen is a dye developed for quantitation of RNA in which fluorescence is produced upon nucleic acid binding 31. For determination of encapsulation efficiency in LNPs, RiboGreen is first added to the sample with LNPs intact to measure the unencapsulated RNA concentration. A detergent solution (e.g. Triton X-100) is then added to disrupt the nanoparticles, releasing encapsulated RNA, and the total amount of RNA in the sample is calculated from RiboGreen fluorescence. Encapsulated RNA is calculated by subtracting unencapsulated RNA from total RNA and encapsulation efficiency is then taken as the ratio of encapsulated RNA to total RNA in the sample.",

While mRNA can be chemically modified to become immune-silent and increase protein expression, LNPs can still trigger innate immune responses and cause inflammation-related adverse effects. Inflammation can in turn suppress mRNA translation and reduce the therapeutic effect. Dexamethasone (Dex) is a widely used anti-inflammatory corticosteroid medication that is structurally similar to cholesterol, a key component of LNPs. Here, we developed LNP formulations with anti-inflammatory properties by partially substituting cholesterol with Dex as a means to reduce inflammation. We demonstrated that Dex-incorporated LNPs effectively abrogated the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u0251) in vitro and significantly reduced its expression in vivo. Reduction of inflammation using this strategy improved in vivo mRNA expression in mice by 1.5-fold. Thus, we envision that our Dex-incorporated LNPs could potentially be used to broadly to reduce the inflammatory responses of LNPs and enhance protein expression of a range of mRNA therapeutics.",

Using a benchmark lipid (D-Lin-MC3) we compared the ability of three helper lipids to transfect dendritic cells in cellulo and in vivo. Studies revealed that the choice of helper lipid does not influence the transfection efficiency of immortalized cells but, LNPs prepared with DOPE (dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine) and \u03b2-sitosterol were more efficient for mRNA transfection in murine dendritic cells than LNPs containing DSPC (distearoylphosphatidylcholine). This higher potency of DOPE and \u03b2-sitosterol LNPs for mRNA expression was also evident in vivo but only at low mRNA doses. Overall, these data provide valuable insight for the design of novel mRNA LNP vaccines.",

LNPs tend to disintegrate due to shear stress during aerosolization, leading to ineffective delivery. Therefore, LNPs need to remain stable through the process of nebulization and mucus penetration, yet labile enough for endosomal escape. To meet these opposing needs, we utilized PEG lipid to enhance the surficial stability of LNPs with the inclusion of a cholesterol analog, \u03b2-sitosterol, to improve endosomal escape. Increased PEG concentrations in LNPs enhanced the shear resistance and mucus penetration, while \u03b2-sitosterol provided LNPs with a polyhedral shape, facilitating endosomal escape. The optimized LNPs exhibited a uniform particle distribution, a polyhedral morphology, and a rapid mucosal diffusion with enhanced gene transfection. Inhaled LNPs led to localized protein production in the mouse lung without pulmonary or systemic toxicity. Repeated administration of these LNPs led to sustained protein production in the lungs. Lastly, mRNA encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was delivered after nebulization to a CFTR-deficient animal model, resulting in the pulmonary expression of this therapeutic protein. This study demonstrated the rational design approach for clinical translation of inhalable LNP-based mRNA therapies.",

Unbound dye is essentially nonfluorescent and has a large extinction coefficient (67,000 cm-1 M-1). The RiboGreen assay allows detection of as little as 1.0 ng/ml RNA in a standard fluorometer, filter fluorometer, or fluorescence microplate reader-surpassing the sensitivity achieved with ethidium bromide by 200-fold. The linear quantitation range for RiboGreen reagent extends over three orders of magnitude in RNA concentration. Using 750 nM RiboGreen reagent, we quantitated 20 ng/ml to 1.0 microg/ml RNA. By diluting the reagent to 75 nM, we could quantitate 1.0 to 50 ng/ml RNA. Both assay ranges exhibited linear fluorescence increases versus RNA concentration (r2 = 0.999). Assay linearity was maintained in the presence of salts, protein, urea, ethanol, chloroform, agarose, and some detergents. Several different RNA types yielded similar signal intensities and detection sensitivities. The assay is easy to use, rapid, and readily adaptable for automation."

We highlight the scope of its major experimental opportunities as a transport-based method, contemporary and up-and-coming investigation potential for polymers, polymer-drug conjugates, polymer assemblies, as well as medical nanoparticles. Special focus lies on molar mass estimates of unimeric polymeric species, self-assemblies in solution, and (co)localization of multicomponent systems in solution alongside the material-biofluid interactions. We close with present challenges and incentives for future research."

To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Blenke et al., 2017)(Blakney et al., 2019). Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression...Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis.",

Many of these innovative therapies include several nucleic acid components (e.g., nuclease mRNA and guide RNA) posing unique analytical challenges when monitoring the quantity and quality of each individual payload substance in the formulated LNP. Current methods were optimized for single payload analysis and often lack resolving power needed to investigate nucleic acid mixtures. Ion pairing reversed phase (IP-RP) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) are increasingly being used to characterize nucleic acids. Here, we studied their application for payload quantification in formulated LNP drug-like products. Using a detergent to disrupt the LNPs, the liberated payloads can be separated on an octadecyl RP column using a fast gradient. Reproducible results were obtained as lipids, and surfactants were efficiently eluted using a high organic solvent wash protocol. Alternatively, we also established an online SEC disruption analysis of the mRNA/LNPs wherein an alcohol and detergent containing a mobile phase was applied. Such conditions universally deformulated all tested LNP samples, indicating that a 5 min-long SEC separation can be used as a high-throughput platform method. In both approaches, the measurements facilitate a multiattribute analysis. Apart from quantitation, the characterization of specific impurities is achieved: IP-RP reveals mRNA-lipid adducts, while SEC informs on size variants, which in turn reduces a laboratory\u2019s analytical workload. These easy-to-adopt LC-based assays are expected to fortify the analytical toolbox for emerging gene therapeutics.",

Because saRNA is a large (~9500\u2009nt), negatively charged molecule, it requires a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for RNA formulations, where the prevailing paradigm is to encapsulate RNA within the particle, including the first FDA-approved small-interfering siRNA therapy. Here, we compared LNP formulations with cationic and ionizable lipids with saRNA either on the interior or exterior of the particle. We show that LNPs formulated with cationic lipids protect saRNA from RNAse degradation, even when it is adsorbed to the surface. Furthermore, cationic LNPs deliver saRNA equivalently to particles formulated with saRNA encapsulated in an ionizable lipid particle, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that cationic and ionizable LNP formulations induce equivalent antibodies against HIV-1 Env gp140 as a model antigen. These studies establish formulating saRNA on the surface of cationic LNPs as an alternative to the paradigm of encapsulating RNA."

Introduction/Background: I should start with a section that provides basic context about mRNA-LNP formulations and why assessing their integrity is important. This section will help frame the analytical techniques discussed later. This will be in synthesis format as it needs to provide a coherent explanation of the context.\n\n2. Chromatography-Based Techniques: Many quotes mention various chromatography techniques like IP-RPLC, SEC, and AEX. These seem to be major analytical approaches for assessing mRNA integrity. This dimension should be in synthesis format to properly explain how these techniques work and their advantages.\n\n3. Electrophoresis-Based Techniques: Several quotes discuss different electrophoresis methods like capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), microchip CE, and iCIEF. This should be in synthesis format to explain the principles and applications of these related techniques.\n\n4. Sample Preparation Methods to Minimize Degradation: This dimension focuses specifically on how to prepare samples while minimizing degradation, addressing the second part of the user query. This should be in synthesis format to properly explain the considerations and techniques.\n\n5. Specialized Analytical Techniques: This would include techniques like analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), RiboGreen assays, and mass photometry that are mentioned in the quotes but don't fit neatly into the other categories. This should be in list format as it presents distinct techniques with their specific applications.\n\n6. Comparative Effectiveness of Techniques: This dimension would synthesize information about which techniques are most effective for specific purposes, directly addressing the \"most effective\" part of the user query. This should be in synthesis format to properly compare and contrast the different approaches.\n\nLet me now assign quotes to each dimension based on their content.",

                "text": "\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have gained significant attention in vaccine and gene therapy applications, especially following the success of COVID-19 vaccines. Assessing the integrity of mRNA payloads within these complex delivery systems presents unique analytical challenges. The fragile nature of RNA molecules makes them susceptible to degradation by ubiquitous ribonucleases (RNases), mechanical stress, and chemical factors during sample preparation and analysis.\n\nEffective analytical techniques must balance the need for detailed characterization with minimal sample perturbation. The enclosed mRNA must be released from the LNP structure for many analyses, yet this process itself can compromise payload integrity. Additionally, the heterogeneous nature of LNP formulations adds complexity to analytical method development. Size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, and sequence integrity all represent critical quality attributes that require assessment.\n\nTraditional analytical approaches have been adapted and new methods developed specifically for mRNA-LNP formulations. These techniques must distinguish between intact and degraded mRNA species while providing information about LNP physical characteristics. The field continues to evolve toward methods that reduce sample manipulation, provide higher resolution, and enable more accurate quantification of intact versus degraded RNA species. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nIon-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC) coupled with UV detection has emerged as a primary method for characterizing mRNA integrity within lipid nanoparticle formulations. This technique enables the separation of negatively charged mRNA molecules based on hydrophobic interactions with the column material, allowing detection of degradation products and shorter fragments that indicate compromised payload integrity. <Paper corpusId=\"253371061\" paperTitle=\"(Blenke et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nTo effectively analyze mRNA within LNPs, the encapsulated payload must first be released from the nanoparticle structure. Various approaches have been developed to accomplish this extraction while minimizing degradation. Non-ionic detergents are commonly employed to disrupt LNPs and liberate nucleic acid cargos, though these can be detrimental to HPLC columns and may cause signal suppression. Alternative extraction methods include organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solutions. <Paper corpusId=\"277729479\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"196350748\" paperTitle=\"(Blakney et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nRecent innovations have focused on optimizing both the extraction process and chromatographic separation. One approach involves using a detergent to disrupt LNPs followed by separation on an octadecyl reversed-phase column with a fast gradient. This method provides reproducible results and efficiently elutes lipids and surfactants using a high organic solvent wash protocol. <Paper corpusId=\"275992112\" paperTitle=\"(Imiolek et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSize exclusion chromatography (SEC) offers an alternative or complementary approach to IP-RPLC. An innovative online SEC disruption analysis method has been developed that uses a mobile phase containing alcohol and detergent to universally deformulate LNP samples. This approach enables a rapid 5-minute separation that can serve as a high-throughput platform method. SEC is particularly valuable for separating mRNA aggregates from intact LNPs. <Paper corpusId=\"275992112\" paperTitle=\"(Imiolek et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267768573\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAnion exchange chromatography (AEX) represents another important technique that can be applied to both free and LNP-encapsulated mRNA. Unlike IP-RPLC, AEX has been demonstrated to be more suitable for analyzing longer RNA molecules, such as the 100-nucleotide RNAs used in CRISPR technology. <Paper corpusId=\"253788302\" paperTitle=\"(Fekete et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"59526403\" paperTitle=\"(Kanavarioti, 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nFor comprehensive characterization, liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) enables simultaneous analysis of LNP components and impurities, providing detailed information valuable for drug development and quality control. This technique allows researchers to identify and quantify specific lipid components after dissolution from the LNP using solvent-based extraction. <Paper corpusId=\"253788302\" paperTitle=\"(Fekete et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThese chromatographic methods not only enable quantification of mRNA payloads but also provide multiattribute analysis capabilities.

                            "A common method to characterize the integrity of the mRNA, i.e., to measure the purity and impurity profile, is IP-RPLC-UV (ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection). 76,49 A reversed-phase stationary phase together with a mobile phase containing ion-pair reagent enables retention and separation of the negatively charged mRNA. The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating.\n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection",

                            "Moreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies (Lokras et al., 2022)(Imio\u0142ek et al., 2025). To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Blenke et al., 2017)(Blakney et al., 2019). Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression",
                            "Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis."

Because saRNA is a large (~9500\u2009nt), negatively charged molecule, it requires a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for RNA formulations, where the prevailing paradigm is to encapsulate RNA within the particle, including the first FDA-approved small-interfering siRNA therapy. Here, we compared LNP formulations with cationic and ionizable lipids with saRNA either on the interior or exterior of the particle. We show that LNPs formulated with cationic lipids protect saRNA from RNAse degradation, even when it is adsorbed to the surface. Furthermore, cationic LNPs deliver saRNA equivalently to particles formulated with saRNA encapsulated in an ionizable lipid particle, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that cationic and ionizable LNP formulations induce equivalent antibodies against HIV-1 Env gp140 as a model antigen. These studies establish formulating saRNA on the surface of cationic LNPs as an alternative to the paradigm of encapsulating RNA."

                            "Several analytical methods are commonly used for mRNA characterization and are employed in quality control (QC) environments to support batch release and stability and assess critical quality attributes (CQAs) at different stages of the drug life cycle, including production and storage. 8,9 Purity is usually assessed by ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC) by measuring product-related impurities, such as short mRNA fragments, 10\u221214 while integrity is usually confirmed by determining mRNA length by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE). 15,16 As an alternative, Raffaele et al. demonstrated the value of using on-chip capillary electrophoresis to determine the purity and integrity of 2000nucleotide (nt) mRNA in lipid nanoparticle vaccines. 17 ecently, considerable efforts have been made to improve the separation, sensitivity, applicability, and turnaround times of the HPLC-based methods. For example, the choice of the IP-RPLC column, the composition of the mobile phase using an ion-pairing agent, and the column temperature have been studied for short 100-nt RNAs. 10,18 Regarding the analysis of long mRNAs, Kuwayama et al. reported the interest in using an octadecyl-based RPLC column with superwide pores for achieving higher separation. 19 Similarly, an ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column has been recently introduced for efficient separation of mRNA aggregates and lipid nanoparticles. 20 Additionally, mass photometry (MP) was recently introduced as an interferometric mass spectrometry (MS) methodology capable of measuring the mass and relative abundance of biomolecules in solutions. 21"

Analytical methods for RNAs up to the 60 nucleotides (nt) have been reported, but they fall short for purity evaluation of 100nt long, used as single guide RNA (sgRNA) in CRISPR technology, and promoted as pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to exploit a single HPLC method and obtain both identity as well as purity, ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography (IP-RP) at high temperature in the presence of an organic cosolvent is the current analytical strategy. Here we report that IP-RP is less suitable compared to the conventional ion-exchange (IEX) for analysis of 100nt RNAs. We demonstrate the relative stability of RNA in the denaturing/basic IEX mobile phase, lay out a protocol to determine the on-the-column stability of any RNA, and establish the applicability of this method for quality testing of sgRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Unless well resolving HPLC methods are used for batch-to-batch evaluation of man-made RNAs, process development will remain shortsighted, and observed off-target effects in-vitro or in-vivo may be partially related to low purity and the presence of shorter sequences."

These methods enable rapid sample processing while requiring careful optimization of sample preparation protocols to minimize mRNA degradation. (5 sources)",
                "text": "\nCapillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) has emerged as a crucial technique for determining mRNA length and integrity within LNP formulations. A significant advancement in this area is the development of microchip capillary electrophoresis methods that offer exceptional throughput. The LabChip GXII Touch instrument enables analysis in approximately 70 seconds per sample, processing a full 96-well plate in just 2.5 hours, making it particularly valuable for vaccine development. Sample preparation for this method requires careful optimization, with high formamide concentrations (>80% v/v) and heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes to ensure complete mRNA denaturation. <Paper corpusId=\"244477586\" paperTitle=\"(Raffaele et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nWhen comparing sample preparation methods for CGE analysis, significant differences in performance have been observed. Recent research has systematically evaluated two common disruption protocols: detergent treatment (Triton X-100) and precipitation by organic solvent (isopropanol). The findings revealed that detergent treatment significantly impacts fluorescence intensity of the main peak, even at low concentrations, resulting in lower integrity measurements and increased variability. In contrast, isopropanol precipitation demonstrates superior performance by removing non-precipitating buffer components, thereby improving assay sensitivity. Optimal conditions for CGE with laser-induced fluorescence (CGE-LIF) include isopropanol precipitation, high urea concentrations, no formamide as a sample diluent, and high concentrations of fluorescent dye. <Paper corpusId=\"277276414\" paperTitle=\"(Tran et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nImaged capillary isoelectric focusing (iCIEF) represents another powerful electrophoretic technique specifically adapted for mRNA-LNP analysis. Two distinct iCIEF methods have been developed, each with complementary strengths. Method A employs 9 M urea as an additive, generating two broad, jagged peaks whose shape changes substantially when samples are stressed, providing detailed stability information. Interestingly, the peak pattern exhibits fine structure that may correlate to different numbers of mRNA molecules within individual LNPs. Method B uses a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea for LNP separation, offering high repeatability of isoelectric point values (<0.5%). Both methods demonstrate well-repeatable peak areas (2-8% relative standard deviation) that correlate linearly with mRNA content. <Paper corpusId=\"251808672\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe value of iCIEF extends beyond basic characterization to process monitoring and formulation development. The technique effectively differentiates the isoelectric points of LNPs containing different ionizable lipids, aiding in LNP identity verification during manufacturing. As a quantitative method, iCIEF provides insights into LNP stability under various conditions, including different storage temperatures, freeze-thaw cycles, and lipid compositions, making it capable of detecting batch-to-batch variability. <Paper corpusId=\"276512626\" paperTitle=\"(Ghizzani et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nBoth CGE and iCIEF complement chromatography-based techniques like ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC). While IP-RPLC excels at assessing mRNA purity by measuring product-related impurities such as short fragments, CGE is particularly well-suited for confirming integrity by determining precise mRNA length. The combined use of these orthogonal techniques provides comprehensive characterization of critical quality attributes throughout the drug lifecycle, including production and storage phases. <Paper corpusId=\"267768573\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "We have developed a quick and reproducible microchip CE method for evaluating the % purity and % integrity of mRNA in mRNA-LNP vaccine samples. The method utilizes the LabChip GXII Touch instrument from Perkin Elmer, which allows for high-throughput sample analysis due to the short run time of \u223c 70 s per sample and can run a 96-well plate in approximately 2.5 h. These advantages are especially useful for vaccine development and the method required minimal changes for optimization of its use for additional mRNA vaccine products. Assay development was optimized mostly with respect to sample preparation since the instrument and separation kit are fixed from Perkin Elmer. Sample treatment was optimized by the addition of high formamide concentration (>80% v/v) and heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 min to ensure mRNA was fully denatured."

                            "Two iCIEF methods have been developed, both having their strengths, and united providing many insights into the quality and stability of mRNA vaccines. The highly repeatable methods offer a lot of very valuable information about the preparation, and at the same time they are flexible to optimize them for various kinds of loaded LNPs. Method A, in which 9 M urea was used as an additive, shows two broad and jagged peaks in which the peak shape changes substantially when stress is added to the samples, and therefore detailed information can be derived about stability. Furthermore, the peak pattern exhibits an interesting fine structure, possibly due to different numbers of mRNA molecules within the individual LNPs. The peak area of the sum of both peaks, with RSDs from 2% to 8% when measured in triplicate, very well correlates linearly with the mRNA content and also apparently depends on the size of the LNPs, as was shown by the additional examinations of the stressed samples with the Zetasizer. In method B, a combination of 5.5 M urea and 2 M N-ethylurea was used for LNP separation by iCIEF. This method is characterized by a high repeatability of the pI value (<0.5%). Again, the well repeatable peak area (2%-7%) correlates linearly with the mRNA content, and added stress is evident by the change in pI and peak area."

For example, the choice of the IP-RPLC column, the composition of the mobile phase using an ion-pairing agent, and the column temperature have been studied for short 100-nt RNAs. 10,18 Regarding the analysis of long mRNAs, Kuwayama et al. reported the interest in using an octadecyl-based RPLC column with superwide pores for achieving higher separation. 19 Similarly, an ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column has been recently introduced for efficient separation of mRNA aggregates and lipid nanoparticles. 20 Additionally, mass photometry (MP) was recently introduced as an interferometric mass spectrometry (MS) methodology capable of measuring the mass and relative abundance of biomolecules in solutions. 21"

                            "Moreover, IP-RP LC can be used to analyze and quantify mRNA in an LNP formulation, enabling the integrity and purity of the mRNA cargo to be assessed by separating it from other LNP components based on its charge and hydrophobicity, thus providing valuable information for QC in the development of mRNA-based therapies (Lokras et al., 2022)(Imio\u0142ek et al., 2025). To this end, a complete extraction of RNA from the carrier is required for quantification of the RNA cargo of nanoparticles. A number of solvents have been employed for extracting RNA from nanoparticles, e.g., non-ionic detergents, organic solvent/aqueous phase mixtures, and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Blenke et al., 2017)(Blakney et al., 2019). Non-ionic detergents are the most widely used extraction reagents due to the effective extraction of nucleic acid cargos from lipid-based nanocarriers. However, detergents are detrimental to HPLC columns, and the LC flow path and can lead to signal suppression",
                            "Recently, an innovative detergent-based deformation process and IP-RP separation have been developed to characterize nucleic acid payloads, ranging from the small interfering RNA to Cas9 mRNA [67,68]. To enable direct measurement of double nucleic acid payloads, the use of a deforming SEC mobile phase composed of low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isopropanol is used. This enables intact LNP samples to be injected directly into the LC flow path, where they are dissolved in their individual components [68]. As shown in Figure 6, the IP-RP LC method has sufficient resolution to separate impurities from mRNA adducts and provide information on mRNA quality in addition to quantification, within a 12 min analysis."

RiboGreen reagent exhibits >1000-fold fluorescence enhancement and high quantum yield (0.65) upon binding nucleic acids, with excitation and emission maxima near those of fluorescein. Unbound dye is essentially nonfluorescent and has a large extinction coefficient (67,000 cm-1 M-1). The RiboGreen assay allows detection of as little as 1.0 ng/ml RNA in a standard fluorometer, filter fluorometer, or fluorescence microplate reader-surpassing the sensitivity achieved with ethidium bromide by 200-fold. The linear quantitation range for RiboGreen reagent extends over three orders of magnitude in RNA concentration. Using 750 nM RiboGreen reagent, we quantitated 20 ng/ml to 1.0 microg/ml RNA. By diluting the reagent to 75 nM, we could quantitate 1.0 to 50 ng/ml RNA. Both assay ranges exhibited linear fluorescence increases versus RNA concentration (r2 = 0.999). Assay linearity was maintained in the presence of salts, protein, urea, ethanol, chloroform, agarose, and some detergents. Several different RNA types yielded similar signal intensities and detection sensitivities. The assay is easy to use, rapid, and readily adaptable for automation."

We have determined a discrete distribution ranging from 1 to 10 mRNA copies with an average of 5 copies per particle for our LNP formulation. However, potential users should keep two limitations in mind. First, this assay cannot distinguish between full length and degraded mRNA and thus confirm the integrity of the encapsulated nucleic acid. An LNP with 5 mRNA copies will have the same density as a particle with 10 half copies. This must be monitored by other assays such as (capillary) gel electrophoresis during drug substance/drug product characterization."

Ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC) coupled with UV detection serves as a primary method for purity assessment by measuring product-related impurities, particularly shorter mRNA fragments. <Paper corpusId=\"253371061\" paperTitle=\"(Blenke et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> This technique has become a cornerstone of mRNA-LNP analysis due to its ability to separate fragments based on hydrophobic interactions with the column material. However, research has shown that IP-RPLC becomes less effective as RNA length increases, with anion exchange chromatography (IEX) demonstrating superior performance for longer RNAs, such as the 100-nucleotide RNAs used in CRISPR technology. <Paper corpusId=\"253371061\" paperTitle=\"(Blenke et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"59526403\" paperTitle=\"(Kanavarioti, 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nCapillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) represents an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC, where separation is based primarily on molecular size rather than hydrophobic interactions. <Paper corpusId=\"253371061\" paperTitle=\"(Blenke et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> While IP-RPLC excels at purity assessment, CGE is particularly effective for confirming integrity by precisely determining mRNA length. <Paper corpusId=\"267768573\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> Recent comparative studies between CGE-LIF and IP-RPLC for mRNA-LNP analysis have revealed important differences in their performance characteristics, particularly regarding sample preparation methods. When comparing detergent treatment (Triton X-100) versus isopropanol precipitation for sample disruption, research shows that detergent treatment significantly impacts fluorescence intensity and results in lower integrity measurements with increased variability. In contrast, isopropanol precipitation demonstrates superior performance by improving assay sensitivity. <Paper corpusId=\"277276414\" paperTitle=\"(Tran et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAmong specialized techniques, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) offers unique advantages for assessing LNP-mRNA formulations. AUC requires minimal sample preparation\u2014only dilution\u2014avoiding potential biases introduced by ultrafiltration, RNA extraction, or particle disruption steps necessary for other techniques. The ability to specifically detect RNA signals using UV detection at 260 nm allows characterization in physiologically relevant media, providing insights that may be more representative of in vivo conditions. <Paper corpusId=\"270020439\" paperTitle=\"(Guerrini et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"244484823\" paperTitle=\"(Valderrama et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nFor comprehensive characterization of mRNA-LNP formulations, multiple analytical methods are typically employed in quality control environments to support batch release and stability testing throughout the drug lifecycle. <Paper corpusId=\"267768573\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> The RiboGreen assay remains widely used specifically for determining encapsulation efficiency, providing complementary information to structural analysis techniques like IP-RPLC and CGE. <Paper corpusId=\"253371061\" paperTitle=\"(Blenke et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nRecent technological advancements have focused on improving separation, sensitivity, applicability, and turnaround times of these analytical methods. Innovations include the development of octadecyl-based RPLC columns with superwide pores for achieving higher separation of long mRNAs and ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography columns for efficient separation of mRNA aggregates from lipid nanoparticles. <Paper corpusId=\"267768573\" paperTitle=\"(Camperi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> These improvements directly address key limitations of traditional methods when applied to increasingly complex mRNA-LNP formulations.\n\nWhen selecting analytical techniques for a specific application, considerations should include the mRNA length, required resolution, sample preparation constraints, and the specific quality attributes being assessed.

                            "A common method to characterize the integrity of the mRNA, i.e., to measure the purity and impurity profile, is IP-RPLC-UV (ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection). 76,49 A reversed-phase stationary phase together with a mobile phase containing ion-pair reagent enables retention and separation of the negatively charged mRNA. The separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material. UV detection at 260 nm is employed, as the aforementioned size restrictions preclude the use of MS detection. The IP-RPLC-UV method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products, i.e. the shorter fragments, to ensure the method is stability-indicating.\n\nCapillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to IP-RPLC-UV, where the separation is based on size. The separation medium is a low viscosity \"separation gel\", consisting of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and additives, typically glycerol, as viscosity enhancers. 49,77,78 The polymers form a three-dimensional network that allows the separation based on size. Larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process. The quantification of the fragments and intact mRNA can be either by UV at 260 nm or fluorescence detection",

                            "Synthetic RNA oligos exhibit purity decreasing as a function of length, because the efficiency of the total synthesis is the numerical product of the individual step efficiencies, typically below 98%. Analytical methods for RNAs up to the 60 nucleotides (nt) have been reported, but they fall short for purity evaluation of 100nt long, used as single guide RNA (sgRNA) in CRISPR technology, and promoted as pharmaceuticals. In an attempt to exploit a single HPLC method and obtain both identity as well as purity, ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography (IP-RP) at high temperature in the presence of an organic cosolvent is the current analytical strategy. Here we report that IP-RP is less suitable compared to the conventional ion-exchange (IEX) for analysis of 100nt RNAs. We demonstrate the relative stability of RNA in the denaturing/basic IEX mobile phase, lay out a protocol to determine the on-the-column stability of any RNA, and establish the applicability of this method for quality testing of sgRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Unless well resolving HPLC methods are used for batch-to-batch evaluation of man-made RNAs, process development will remain shortsighted, and observed off-target effects in-vitro or in-vivo may be partially related to low purity and the presence of shorter sequences."

For example, the choice of the IP-RPLC column, the composition of the mobile phase using an ion-pairing agent, and the column temperature have been studied for short 100-nt RNAs. 10,18 Regarding the analysis of long mRNAs, Kuwayama et al. reported the interest in using an octadecyl-based RPLC column with superwide pores for achieving higher separation. 19 Similarly, an ultrawide pore size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column has been recently introduced for efficient separation of mRNA aggregates and lipid nanoparticles. 20 Additionally, mass photometry (MP) was recently introduced as an interferometric mass spectrometry (MS) methodology capable of measuring the mass and relative abundance of biomolecules in solutions. 21"

                            "The technique requires a relatively low amount of sample and no sample preparation (apart from dilution step). This is extremely important as it avoids any potential bias in the results that could be introduced by ultrafiltration steps, RNA extraction, or particle disruption that are needed when using other analytical techniques. The simplicity of the sample preparation and the specific detection of the signal from the RNA molecule (using the UV detector at 260 nm) also allow the characterization of LNP-mRNA in physiologically relevant media [34]."

We highlight the scope of its major experimental opportunities as a transport-based method, contemporary and up-and-coming investigation potential for polymers, polymer-drug conjugates, polymer assemblies, as well as medical nanoparticles. Special focus lies on molar mass estimates of unimeric polymeric species, self-assemblies in solution, and (co)localization of multicomponent systems in solution alongside the material-biofluid interactions. We close with present challenges and incentives for future research."
