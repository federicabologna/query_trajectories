The field has expanded greatly and now comprises various modalities, including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon-emission computed tomography. Because each modality has its specific advantages and disadvantages, the combination of different techniques has become standard practice for tumor detection, staging, and treatment evaluation [1]. \n\nHowever, when surgery is required, translation of these images to the operation field remains a major challenge for the surgeon. Visual appearance and palpation is the only way to discriminate between tumor and normal tissue and consequently determine an adequate tumor-free margin during surgery. This is a critical aspect of oncologic surgery because, apart from tumor characteristics (i.e., stage, differentiation grade), complete surgical removal is pivotal for the prognosis of the patient. \n\nReal-time imaging technologies could offer the possibility to put the images right under the hands of the surgeon, warranting intra-operative image-guided surgery. In order to detect malignant cells or tissues, the various hallmarks of cancer can be used as a target for imaging strategies: increased growth and growth factor signaling receptors, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and increased proteolytic activity resulting in tissue invasion and metastasis (Fig. 1) [2]. \n\nThe characteristic of increased metabolism is exploited in PET technology, using the glucose-mimetic 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F] fluoro-D-glucose. Tumor cells most frequently use glycol-ysis for energy generation, resulting in an increased glucose metabolism and the overexpression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) [3]. 2-Deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose is taken up by metabolically active cells, making it applicable in a wide range of tumors [4]. For intra-operative evaluation of tumor localization and margin status in breast cancer surgery, a hand-held PET probe to detect the high-energy gamma rays during surgery has been developed [5].",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detecting hepatic micrometastases from melanoma at a very early stage and in aiding tumor resection by intraoperative guidance. Methods: In vivo studies were performed by following protocols approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research at Xiamen University. First, a mouse model of B16 melanoma metastatic to the liver (n = 10) was established to study the development of micrometastases in vivo. Next, the mice were imaged by a scalable PAI instrument, ultrasound, 9.4-T high-resolution MRI, PET/CT, and bioluminescence imaging. PAI scans acquired with optical wavelengths of 680\u2013850 nm were kept spectrally unmixed by using a linear least-squares method to differentiate various components. Differences in signal-to-background ratios among different modalities were determined with the 2-tailed paired t test. The diagnostic results were assessed with histologic examination. Excised liver samples from patients diagnosed with hepatic cancer were also examined to identify the tumor boundaries. Surgical removal of metastatic melanoma was precisely guided in vivo by the portable PAI system. Results: PAI was able to detect metastases as small as approximately 400 \u03bcm at a depth of up to 7 mm in vivo\u2014a size that is smaller than can be detected with ultrasound and MRI. The tumor-to-liver ratio for PAI at 8 d (4.2 \u00b1 0.2, n = 6) and 14 d (9.2 \u00b1 0.4, n = 5) was significantly higher than for PET/CT (1.8 \u00b1 0.1, n = 5, and 4.5 \u00b1 0.2, n = 5, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Functional PAI revealed dynamic oxygen saturation changes during tumor growth. The limit of detection was approximately 219 cells/\u03bcL in vitro. We successfully performed intraoperative PAI-guided surgery in vivo using the portable PAI system. Conclusion: Our findings offer a rapid and effective complementary clinical imaging application to noninvasively detect micrometastases and guide intraoperative resection.",

Functional PAI revealed dynamic oxygen saturation changes during tumor growth. The limit of detection was approximately 219 cells/\u03bcL in vitro. We successfully performed intraoperative PAI-guided surgery in vivo using the portable PAI system. Conclusion: Our findings offer a rapid and effective complementary clinical imaging application to noninvasively detect micrometastases and guide intraoperative resection.\n",

Due to the relatively asymptomatic nature and the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, OC is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. The current treatment for advanced OC relies on the synergistic effect of combining surgical cytoreduction and chemotherapy; however, beside the fact that chemotherapy resistance is a major challenge in OC management, new imaging strategies are needed to target microscopic lesions and improve both cytoreductive surgery and patient outcomes. In this context, nanostructured probes are emerging as a new class of medical tool that can simultaneously provide imaging contrast, target tumor cells, and carry a wide range of medicines resulting in better diagnosis and therapeutic precision. Herein we summarize several exemplary efforts in nanomedicine for addressing unmet clinical needs.",

An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease [44]. OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction [45,46] (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness.",

Di Lorenzo, G. Ricci, G. M. Severini, F. Romano, S. Biffi\n## Abstract\nDespite significant advances in cancer diagnostics and treatment, ovarian cancers (OC) continue to kill more than 150,000 women every year worldwide. Due to the relatively asymptomatic nature and the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, OC is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. The current treatment for advanced OC relies on the synergistic effect of combining surgical cytoreduction and chemotherapy; however, beside the fact that chemotherapy resistance is a major challenge in OC management, new imaging strategies are needed to target microscopic lesions and improve both cytoreductive surgery and patient outcomes. In this context, nanostructured probes are emerging as a new class of medical tool that can simultaneously provide imaging contrast, target tumor cells, and carry a wide range of medicines resulting in better diagnosis and therapeutic precision. Herein we summarize several exemplary efforts in nanomedicine for addressing unmet clinical needs.\n## Surgery\nSurgical management of OC remains the cornerstone treatment of the disease (Figure 1). An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease [44]. OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction [45,46] (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness.",

            "abstract": "Background and objectives: VATS segmentectomy has been proven to be effective in the treatment of stage I NSCLC, but its technical complexity remains one of the most challenging aspects for thoracic surgeons. Furthermore, 3D-CT reconstruction images can help in planning and performing surgical procedures. In this paper, we present our personal experience of 11 VATS anatomical resections performed after accurate pre-operative planning with 3D reconstructions. Materials and methods: A 3D virtual model of the lungs, airways, and vasculature was obtained, starting from a 1.25 mm 3-phase contrast CT scan, and the original images were used for the semi-automatic segmentation of the lung parenchyma, airways, and tumor. Results: Six males and five females were included in this study. The median diameter of the pulmonary lesion at the pre-operative chest CT scan was 20 mm. The surgical indication was confirmed in seven patients: in three cases, a lobectomy, instead of a segmentectomy, was needed due to intraoperative findings of nodal metastasis. Meanwhile, only in one case, we performed a lobectomy because of inadequate surgical resection margins. Skin-to-skin operative average time was 142 (IQR 1-3 105\u2013182.5) min. The median post-operative stay was 6 (IQR 1-3 3.5\u20137) days. The mean value of the closest surgical margin was 13.7 mm. Conclusion: Image-guided reconstructions are a useful tool for surgeons to perform complex resections in order to spare healthy parenchyma and to ensure disease-free margins. Nevertheless, human skill and surgeon experience still remain fundamental for the final decisions regarding the proper resection to perform.",

A few years ago, the majority of lung cancers were discovered in advanced stages, where surgery could not determine any indication and patients were referred to a chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy program with a dismal prognosis. However, the recent introduction of the Lung Cancer Screening Program and the improvement of radiological items with the spread of Low-dose Computed Tomography machines are making possible the diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in its early stages. Unless lung cancer treatment is extremely varied, surgical resection remains the mainstay for early stage and even for locally advanced disease [1,2]. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) has radically changed the world of thoracic surgery; it has achieved optimal results compared to open approaches [3]. In fact, it ensures less post-operative pain, and it is associated with a reduction in chest tube duration and length of hospital stay (LOS), thus reducing patient morbidity and mortality. For a long time, lobectomy has represented the gold standard for the treatment of all potentially resectable Medicina 2023, 59, 2079 2 of 9 lung tumors, while segmentectomy was considered a lung-sparing option in cases where lobectomy was not feasible because of the patient's fragility. Nowadays, pulmonary lobectomy and segmentectomy still represent the two main types of anatomical resections for primitive tumors. In particular, segmentectomy has recently been demonstrated to be a valuable alternative to lobectomy, not only in unfit patients. In fact, it has achieved great results in terms of local disease control and disease-free survival for tumors less than 20 mm in diameter [4][5][6]. Moreover, it has demonstrated an acceptable intra and post-operative complications rate. However, it is well-accepted that anatomical segmentectomy is a more challenging procedure compared with lobectomy, because the anatomy of lung segments is more complex. Indeed, it requires a careful assessment of each patient's anatomy, which may have numerous variations and anomalies in bronchovascular structures.",

Cannone, V. Verzeletti, A. Busetto, Luigi Lione, A. Bonis, S. Nicotra, Alessandro Rebusso, M. Mammana, M. Schiavon, A. Dell\u2019Amore, Federico Rea\n## Abstract\nBackground and objectives: VATS segmentectomy has been proven to be effective in the treatment of stage I NSCLC, but its technical complexity remains one of the most challenging aspects for thoracic surgeons. Furthermore, 3D-CT reconstruction images can help in planning and performing surgical procedures. In this paper, we present our personal experience of 11 VATS anatomical resections performed after accurate pre-operative planning with 3D reconstructions. Materials and methods: A 3D virtual model of the lungs, airways, and vasculature was obtained, starting from a 1.25 mm 3-phase contrast CT scan, and the original images were used for the semi-automatic segmentation of the lung parenchyma, airways, and tumor. Results: Six males and five females were included in this study. The median diameter of the pulmonary lesion at the pre-operative chest CT scan was 20 mm. The surgical indication was confirmed in seven patients: in three cases, a lobectomy, instead of a segmentectomy, was needed due to intraoperative findings of nodal metastasis. Meanwhile, only in one case, we performed a lobectomy because of inadequate surgical resection margins. Skin-to-skin operative average time was 142 (IQR 1-3 105\u2013182.5) min. The median post-operative stay was 6 (IQR 1-3 3.5\u20137) days. The mean value of the closest surgical margin was 13.7 mm. Conclusion: Image-guided reconstructions are a useful tool for surgeons to perform complex resections in order to spare healthy parenchyma and to ensure disease-free margins. Nevertheless, human skill and surgeon experience still remain fundamental for the final decisions regarding the proper resection to perform.\n## Introduction\nLung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer diagnosis and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. A few years ago, the majority of lung cancers were discovered in advanced stages, where surgery could not determine any indication and patients were referred to a chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy program with a dismal prognosis. However, the recent introduction of the Lung Cancer Screening Program and the improvement of radiological items with the spread of Low-dose Computed Tomography machines are making possible the diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in its early stages. Unless lung cancer treatment is extremely varied, surgical resection remains the mainstay for early stage and even for locally advanced disease [1,2]. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) has radically changed the world of thoracic surgery; it has achieved optimal results compared to open approaches [3]. In fact, it ensures less post-operative pain, and it is associated with a reduction in chest tube duration and length of hospital stay (LOS), thus reducing patient morbidity and mortality. For a long time, lobectomy has represented the gold standard for the treatment of all potentially resectable Medicina 2023, 59, 2079 2 of 9 lung tumors, while segmentectomy was considered a lung-sparing option in cases where lobectomy was not feasible because of the patient's fragility. Nowadays, pulmonary lobectomy and segmentectomy still represent the two main types of anatomical resections for primitive tumors. In particular, segmentectomy has recently been demonstrated to be a valuable alternative to lobectomy, not only in unfit patients. In fact, it has achieved great results in terms of local disease control and disease-free survival for tumors less than 20 mm in diameter [4][5][6]. Moreover, it has demonstrated an acceptable intra and post-operative complications rate. However, it is well-accepted that anatomical segmentectomy is a more challenging procedure compared with lobectomy, because the anatomy of lung segments is more complex. Indeed, it requires a careful assessment of each patient's anatomy, which may have numerous variations and anomalies in bronchovascular structures.",

In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

Ryoo, Samer A. Naffouje, Sunam Mander, K. Christov, Jing Wang, A. Green, A. Shilkaitis, T. K. Das Gupta, Tohru Yamada\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nBreast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

With an overall 5-year survival rate of 15-25%, it is the sixth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality [1]. These epidemiological data include both histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is the predominant type [2]. Multimodal therapy combining (neoadjuvant) chemo-/radiotherapy and resection improves the outcome in non-metastatic patients [3]. However, up to 88.9% of the patients develop metastases within 3 years after curative surgery, with a median disease-free interval after surgery of 1 year [4,5,6,7]. Due to limited therapy options, the prognosis after recurrence is extremely poor, with a median survival of 3-7 months [8,9,10]. Moreover, guidelines from the European Soci-ety for Medical Oncology (ESMO) report that palliative chemotherapy for stage IV patients is less effective for SCC than for AC. Cisplatin-based combinations tend to show an increased response rate but no benefit regarding survival; therefore, either best supportive care or monotherapy should be considered in ESCC [11]. In contrast, in various tumor entities metastases limited in number and extent (i.e. oligometastases) are increasingly considered suitable for localized therapy with possible curative intent or at least systemic control, e.g. colorectal cancer [12,13]. Such localized therapy might include surgery but also image-guided local ablation techniques like radiofrequency ablation or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (IBT). However, resection is not possible in majority of patients due to distribution of metastases, contraindications for surgery, or general anesthesia, apart from surgery-associated morbidity and mortality. IBT of parenchymal or-gans is a relatively new technique, where an 192 Iridium source is inserted directly in metastatic lesion through percutaneously implanted applicators, placed in an image-guided minimal invasive intervention, and allowing a well-defined single",

                    "text": "Breast cancer is among the most frequent cancers to affect women, exhibiting an average lifetime risk of 1 in 8 [1]. It is a complex disease that is of particular concern for aging women and those with family history of cancer. To combat breast cancer, and due to the availability of medical imaging technology, routine breast cancer screening is now a relatively standard practice in the developed world [2]. Most women over the age of 50, or younger at-risk individuals, are encouraged to undertake standardized annual mammograms as well as any appropriate follow-up procedures [3,4]. In cases that lead to a cancer diagnosis, medical imaging is used to evaluate, or stage, the cancer [5]. For example, due to their small size, the ideal treatment of stage I and most stage II cancers involves Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) [6]. One of the goals of BCS is to remove the whole tumor while sparing the neighboring healthy tissue. This is often accomplished by use of various medical imaging systems which permit the surgeon to localize the suspect lesion with better accuracy than physical examination alone [7]. \n\nBy monitoring neoadjuvant therapy, medical imaging continues to play a vital role in the treatment of stage III and higher breast cancers, as well as tumors which are inoperable due to location or extent [8]. The aim of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the cancer extent, or tumor size, and potentially down-stage the cancer. In responding patients this treatment course may open up new surgical options such as BCS versus radical mastectomy, or even facilitate a surgical option when there was none before. Indeed, the size of the tumor in primary breast cancer is the single most important factor determining the cancer stage [9]. As a result, the accuracy of tumor measurement can have a significant effect on selecting an appropriate follow-up action, as reflected in the widely adopted revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1, released 2009) originally prepared by the International Working Group [10]. Amongst other changes, the updated definition of \"tumor progression\" now includes an absolute increase of the largest tumor diameter by a minimum of 5 mm.",

Kosik, M. Brackstone, A. Kornecki, A. Chamson-Reig, Philip Wong, J. Carson\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Overview\nBreast cancer is among the most frequent cancers to affect women, exhibiting an average lifetime risk of 1 in 8 [1]. It is a complex disease that is of particular concern for aging women and those with family history of cancer. To combat breast cancer, and due to the availability of medical imaging technology, routine breast cancer screening is now a relatively standard practice in the developed world [2]. Most women over the age of 50, or younger at-risk individuals, are encouraged to undertake standardized annual mammograms as well as any appropriate follow-up procedures [3,4]. In cases that lead to a cancer diagnosis, medical imaging is used to evaluate, or stage, the cancer [5]. For example, due to their small size, the ideal treatment of stage I and most stage II cancers involves Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) [6]. One of the goals of BCS is to remove the whole tumor while sparing the neighboring healthy tissue. This is often accomplished by use of various medical imaging systems which permit the surgeon to localize the suspect lesion with better accuracy than physical examination alone [7]. \n\nBy monitoring neoadjuvant therapy, medical imaging continues to play a vital role in the treatment of stage III and higher breast cancers, as well as tumors which are inoperable due to location or extent [8]. The aim of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the cancer extent, or tumor size, and potentially down-stage the cancer. In responding patients this treatment course may open up new surgical options such as BCS versus radical mastectomy, or even facilitate a surgical option when there was none before. Indeed, the size of the tumor in primary breast cancer is the single most important factor determining the cancer stage [9]. As a result, the accuracy of tumor measurement can have a significant effect on selecting an appropriate follow-up action, as reflected in the widely adopted revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1, released 2009) originally prepared by the International Working Group [10]. Amongst other changes, the updated definition of \"tumor progression\" now includes an absolute increase of the largest tumor diameter by a minimum of 5 mm.",

The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the tumor cavity + 1.5 cm cropped 5 mm off skin with the mean PTV30 of 146 cc (range 43-408). Clinical follow-up included history and physical, breast imaging, and the validated Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) at 6 to 12 months intervals. Results: A total of 50 patients with 52 tumors were enrolled with a median age of 76 (range 51 to 89) between November 2018 and July 2022 with 23 patients (46%) undergoing oncoplastic breast surgery.

Treatment was well tolerated with 22% grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity and 4% late toxicity consisting of grade 1 pain. Physician-rated long-term cosmesis was rated as 83% excellent and 17% good. BCTOS scores at baseline were 58% excellent (91% lumpectomy, 13% oncoplastic), 42% good (9% lumpectomy, 88% oncoplastic), 0% fair to poor, and at \u22652 year follow up were 92% excellent, (100 % lumpectomy, 86% oncoplastic), 8% good (0 % lumpectomy, 14% oncoplastic), and 0% fair to poor. Conclusion: This trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a modernized Florence regimen in low-risk stage 0 to 1 breast cancer patients treated at a community hospital. Long-term cosmetic outcomes were excellent and oncoplastic reconstruction does not appear to be a contraindication for APBI.\n Citation Format: Rachel Radigan, Vani Gupta, Andrew T.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nA significant proportion of patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are considered at high risk for complications or mortality after lobectomy. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) previously published important considerations in determining which patients are considered high risk. The current objective was to evaluate treatment options and important factors to consider during treatment selection for these high-risk patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe AATS Clinical Practice Standards Committee assembled an expert panel to review treatment options for high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. After a systematic search of the literature identification of lung-nodule-related factors to consider in treatment selection, the panel developed expert consensus statements and vignettes using a modified Delphi method. A 75% consensus was required for approval.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expert panel identified sublobar resection, image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA), and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), which is also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), as modalities applicable in the treatment of high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. Fourteen statements and 5 vignettes illustrating clinical scenarios were formulated, revised, and ultimately approved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe choice of which modality (sublobar resection, SABR, or IGTA) is optimal in high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC is complex, but a surgical approach is generally favored when deemed safe. SABR and IGTA are reasonable options in select patients, with SABR being the likely next choice in nonsurgical patients. If possible, obtaining a biopsy is very important prior non-surgical treatment. A multi-disciplinary review of patient and tumor characteristics is essential for achieving an optimal decision.

Swanson\n## Abstract\nOBJECTIVE\nA significant proportion of patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are considered at high risk for complications or mortality after lobectomy. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) previously published important considerations in determining which patients are considered high risk. The current objective was to evaluate treatment options and important factors to consider during treatment selection for these high-risk patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe AATS Clinical Practice Standards Committee assembled an expert panel to review treatment options for high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. After a systematic search of the literature identification of lung-nodule-related factors to consider in treatment selection, the panel developed expert consensus statements and vignettes using a modified Delphi method. A 75% consensus was required for approval.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expert panel identified sublobar resection, image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA), and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), which is also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), as modalities applicable in the treatment of high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. Fourteen statements and 5 vignettes illustrating clinical scenarios were formulated, revised, and ultimately approved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe choice of which modality (sublobar resection, SABR, or IGTA) is optimal in high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC is complex, but a surgical approach is generally favored when deemed safe. SABR and IGTA are reasonable options in select patients, with SABR being the likely next choice in nonsurgical patients. If possible, obtaining a biopsy is very important prior non-surgical treatment. A multi-disciplinary review of patient and tumor characteristics is essential for achieving an optimal decision. The clinical treatment decision should also take patient perspectives, preferences, and quality of life into consideration.\n",

            "abstract": "\n Background pCR rates in stage II \u2013 III HER2-positive breast cancer have greatly improved since the addition of HER2 targeted agents to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are associated with excellent long-term survival. While longer treatment regimens increase pCR rate, early complete responses are also common. We evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on the identification of early complete responders.\n Methods 45 hospitals across the Netherlands participated in the phase 2 TRAIN-3 trial. Patients received neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz). Response to treatment was monitored every three cycles and patients were referred for surgery in case of a radiologic complete response (rCR) or after a maximum of 9 cycles. RCR was defined as the absence of pathological enhancement on MRI breast plus negative vacuum assisted core biopsies in case of hormone-receptor positive (HR+) tumors. In addition, negative fine needle aspiration or lymph node biopsy was required in patients with nodal involvement at baseline. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Here, we report locally assessed rCR and pCR rates after 3, 6 and 9 cycles, the negative predictive value of rCR assessment and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Analyses are stratified by HR-status.\n Results We included 467 patients between April 2019 and May 2021. Median age was 51 years, 69% had stage II disease and 232 had HR+ tumors. 33.6% of HR- patients and 15.5% of HR+ patients achieved pCR after 3 cycles of PTC-Ptz (see table). The NPV was higher in HR- patients and independent of the number of cycles. AE evaluation is currently ongoing.\n Conclusion Three cycles of PTC-Ptz induce an early pCR in one in three HR- and one in six HR+ tumors in patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI-based response evaluation identifies these patients with \u00b187% certainty in HR- disease and \u00b158% in HR+ disease. Continuation of PTC-Ptz after 6 cycles further improves pCR rates and can be considered to reduce the need for adjuvant T-DM1. Efficacy and safety of this image-guided approach to tailor treatment duration need to be confirmed with follow-up in EFS and OS analyses.\n Table 1: Cumulative rCR & pCR according to HR-status *Including patients who underwent surgery for other reasons than rCR\n Citation Format: Anna van der Voort, Mette S. van Ramshorst, Rob Kessels, Ingrid A.

Sonke\n## Abstract\n\n Background pCR rates in stage II \u2013 III HER2-positive breast cancer have greatly improved since the addition of HER2 targeted agents to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are associated with excellent long-term survival. While longer treatment regimens increase pCR rate, early complete responses are also common. We evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on the identification of early complete responders.\n Methods 45 hospitals across the Netherlands participated in the phase 2 TRAIN-3 trial. Patients received neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz). Response to treatment was monitored every three cycles and patients were referred for surgery in case of a radiologic complete response (rCR) or after a maximum of 9 cycles. RCR was defined as the absence of pathological enhancement on MRI breast plus negative vacuum assisted core biopsies in case of hormone-receptor positive (HR+) tumors. In addition, negative fine needle aspiration or lymph node biopsy was required in patients with nodal involvement at baseline. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Here, we report locally assessed rCR and pCR rates after 3, 6 and 9 cycles, the negative predictive value of rCR assessment and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Analyses are stratified by HR-status.\n Results We included 467 patients between April 2019 and May 2021. Median age was 51 years, 69% had stage II disease and 232 had HR+ tumors. 33.6% of HR- patients and 15.5% of HR+ patients achieved pCR after 3 cycles of PTC-Ptz (see table). The NPV was higher in HR- patients and independent of the number of cycles. AE evaluation is currently ongoing.\n Conclusion Three cycles of PTC-Ptz induce an early pCR in one in three HR- and one in six HR+ tumors in patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI-based response evaluation identifies these patients with \u00b187% certainty in HR- disease and \u00b158% in HR+ disease. Continuation of PTC-Ptz after 6 cycles further improves pCR rates and can be considered to reduce the need for adjuvant T-DM1. Efficacy and safety of this image-guided approach to tailor treatment duration need to be confirmed with follow-up in EFS and OS analyses.\n Table 1: Cumulative rCR & pCR according to HR-status *Including patients who underwent surgery for other reasons than rCR\n Citation Format: Anna van der Voort, Mette S. van Ramshorst, Rob Kessels, Ingrid A.

            "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Epithelial ovarian\u2013tubal\u2013peritoneal cancer (EOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery is the most important prognostic factor in its management. When complete cytoreduction is anticipated to be challenging, neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) becomes an alternative. Imaging modalities are utilized in the decision-making process for primary treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and accuracy of preoperative MRI, CT, and 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting the extent of EOC. Materials and Methods: Between 2017 and 2018, 24 patients with primary (with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or recurrent EOC diagnosed at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, were enrolled in this study. These 24 women underwent preoperative imaging modalities within 7 days prior to surgery. The results were compared with histopathological findings, considered the gold standard. Results: We evaluated 24 anatomic regions most commonly involved in EOC. The sensitivity of MRI, CT, and PET/CT in detecting \u2265 0.5 cm implants was 95%, 84%, and 86%, respectively. However, when including implants < 0.5 cm, sensitivity decreased significantly to 40%, 38%, and 42%, respectively. The calculated area under the curve (AUC) for tumors, including those < 0.5 cm, was evaluated as weak for all three modalities (MRI: 0.689, CT: 0.678, PET/CT: 0.691), with PET/CT detecting the largest area. For detecting tumors \u2265 0.5 cm, the AUCs were 0.974, 0.921, and 0.923 for MRI, CT, and PET/CT, respectively. The largest AUC was calculated with MRI, and the AUCs for all three methods were evaluated as excellent. Accuracy was comparable among all three imaging modalities, and no statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05). Conclusions: While imaging modalities are valuable tools for evaluating abdominal spread in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), they have demonstrated limited success in detecting miliary disease. The risk of false negatives for miliary tumors on PET/CT may be mitigated by combining it with other imaging modalities such as MRI or CT. Further investigations are necessary to identify more accurate imaging techniques for this challenging clinical scenario.",

                    "text": "Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers arise from the coelomic epithelium or modified mesothelium [1]. Surface epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer [2]. Epithelial ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers have been recognized as one neoplastic entity because a lot of evidence points to a common M\u00fcllerian epithelium derivation and similar management of these three neoplasms [3,4]. \n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage (75%), often due to its asymptomatic nature [5]. It remains the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, accounting for 43% of deaths [6]. \n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy following primary cytoreductive surgery forms the cornerstone of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [7]. Evidence suggests that optimal cytoreduction is the most important prognostic factor of survival [8,9]. \n\nCytoreductive surgery is more feasible in patients with early-stage disease; however, individuals with advanced-stage EOC frequently present with extensive metastatic disease. This makes primary cytoreductive surgery an aggressive procedure with potentially high perioperative morbidity and mortality. \n\nPatients with advanced-stage disease, extensive tumor burden, older age, poor performance status or medical comorbidities may benefit from neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) [10,11]. \n\nImaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 18-Florodeoksiglukoz positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide valuable information regarding the extent of the disease, the location of peritoneal metastases, and the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery. This critical information aids gynecologic oncologists in determining the most appropriate therapeutic strategy [12]. \n\nAlthough CT is most commonly used to stage ovarian cancer patients, MRI and PET/CT are increasingly used in specialized centers. \n\nThis study aims to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for EOC.",

G. Kartal, Z. \u00d6zkan, S. Topuz, M. Salihoglu\n## Abstract\nBackground and Objectives: Epithelial ovarian\u2013tubal\u2013peritoneal cancer (EOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery is the most important prognostic factor in its management. When complete cytoreduction is anticipated to be challenging, neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) becomes an alternative. Imaging modalities are utilized in the decision-making process for primary treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and accuracy of preoperative MRI, CT, and 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting the extent of EOC. Materials and Methods: Between 2017 and 2018, 24 patients with primary (with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or recurrent EOC diagnosed at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, were enrolled in this study. These 24 women underwent preoperative imaging modalities within 7 days prior to surgery. The results were compared with histopathological findings, considered the gold standard. Results: We evaluated 24 anatomic regions most commonly involved in EOC. The sensitivity of MRI, CT, and PET/CT in detecting \u2265 0.5 cm implants was 95%, 84%, and 86%, respectively. However, when including implants < 0.5 cm, sensitivity decreased significantly to 40%, 38%, and 42%, respectively. The calculated area under the curve (AUC) for tumors, including those < 0.5 cm, was evaluated as weak for all three modalities (MRI: 0.689, CT: 0.678, PET/CT: 0.691), with PET/CT detecting the largest area. For detecting tumors \u2265 0.5 cm, the AUCs were 0.974, 0.921, and 0.923 for MRI, CT, and PET/CT, respectively. The largest AUC was calculated with MRI, and the AUCs for all three methods were evaluated as excellent. Accuracy was comparable among all three imaging modalities, and no statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05). Conclusions: While imaging modalities are valuable tools for evaluating abdominal spread in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), they have demonstrated limited success in detecting miliary disease. The risk of false negatives for miliary tumors on PET/CT may be mitigated by combining it with other imaging modalities such as MRI or CT. Further investigations are necessary to identify more accurate imaging techniques for this challenging clinical scenario.\n## Introduction\nApproximately 90% of ovarian cancers arise from the coelomic epithelium or modified mesothelium [1]. Surface epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer [2]. Epithelial ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers have been recognized as one neoplastic entity because a lot of evidence points to a common M\u00fcllerian epithelium derivation and similar management of these three neoplasms [3,4]. \n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage (75%), often due to its asymptomatic nature [5]. It remains the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, accounting for 43% of deaths [6]. \n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy following primary cytoreductive surgery forms the cornerstone of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [7]. Evidence suggests that optimal cytoreduction is the most important prognostic factor of survival [8,9]. \n\nCytoreductive surgery is more feasible in patients with early-stage disease; however, individuals with advanced-stage EOC frequently present with extensive metastatic disease. This makes primary cytoreductive surgery an aggressive procedure with potentially high perioperative morbidity and mortality. \n\nPatients with advanced-stage disease, extensive tumor burden, older age, poor performance status or medical comorbidities may benefit from neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) [10,11]. \n\nImaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 18-Florodeoksiglukoz positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide valuable information regarding the extent of the disease, the location of peritoneal metastases, and the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery. This critical information aids gynecologic oncologists in determining the most appropriate therapeutic strategy [12]. \n\nAlthough CT is most commonly used to stage ovarian cancer patients, MRI and PET/CT are increasingly used in specialized centers. \n\nThis study aims to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for EOC.",

Surgery is a fundamental treatment option used to prevent, diagnose and cure cancer [40]. Additionally, surgery is used for palliative care and cosmesis [40]. Preventive surgery aims to remove tissue that is susceptible to carcinogenesis, while diagnostic techniques are important in determining the appropriate treatment and management of cancer [40]. In the attempt to cure cancer patients, surgery (minor or major) is vital, always needed and greatly effects patient outcomes [40].

In 2030, surgery will be required by approximately 80% of the estimated 21.6 mil new cancer cases [40]. A promising use of Nbs in surgery is imaging-guided surgery [11].

Additionally, the dual-labeled trastuzumab enabled the image-guided resection of tumors [41]. Kijanka et al.

Methods This retrospective study was conducted in Shanghai Ninth People\u2019s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, between August 2019 and August 2021, and consecutively included patients who had undergone computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation for NSCLC.

Kitagawa\n## Abstract\nOver the last 20 years, the sentinel node (SN) concept has been widely applied to the surgical staging of both breast cancer and melanoma. However, the validity of this concept has been controversial for esophageal cancer, because SN mapping for esophageal cancer is not considered to be technically easy because of the complicated multidirectional lymphatic networks of the esophagus and mediastinum. Nevertheless, studies including meta\u2010analyses indicated that SN mapping may be feasible in early esophageal cancer. Transthoracic esophagectomy with three\u2010field lymphadenectomy was developed as a potential curative procedure for thoracic esophageal cancer. However, this highly invasive procedure might increase morbidity and reduce patients\u2019 quality of life (QOL) after esophagectomy. Although further validation based on multicenter trials using the standard protocol of SN mapping for esophageal cancer is required, SN navigation surgery would enable us to carry out personalized and limited lymph node dissection which might reduce morbidity and maintain patients\u2019 QOL.\n## | CONCLUSION\nThe incidence of lymph node metastasis is relatively high even in cN0 early-stage esophageal cancer. Therefore, SN mapping must be accurate for carrying out SN navigation surgery in esophageal cancer. Previous studies suggested that the SN concept appears to be valid and radio-guided SN mapping may be feasible in cT1N0 esophageal cancer. Further accumulation of evidence based on multicenter trials using a standard protocol of SN mapping is needed, but SN navigation surgery will become an ideal less invasive personalized treatment for early-stage esophageal cancer.",

Whereas radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were once the standard practices, breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is now an option for patients with early-stage breast cancer and is also a viable option for women with locally advanced breast cancer who show a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapies [113]. Furthermore, the high rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes raise the question of whether surgery could be safely avoided, especially if the local tumor has been effectively eradicated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy [114]. This could potentially minimize the complications related to surgery and anesthesia, thereby enhancing cosmetic outcomes and improving patients' quality of life. However, it remains uncertain how to accurately identify patients who have no residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who can safely forgo surgical intervention [115]. Therefore, clinical research in the last 10 years has been mainly focused on imaging and minimally invasive biopsies to exclude residual cancer.

Surgery or radiation therapy (RT) as the sole treatment modality is recommended for approximately 30%-40% of patients with early stage disease. Both treatment approaches result in similar survival for various head and neck cancers. Additionally, around 60% of patients with locally or regionally advanced disease at diagnosis will require combined therapy. 1 Therefore, it is important to evaluate methods to improve treatment efficacy in the RT treatment chain. This review evaluates the influence of metabolic imaging in target volume delineation and its impact in RT planning.\n\nOne of the primary stages in the RT pathway, regardless of treatment site, is the delineation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). In head and neck cancer primary and nodal target volumes are routinely delineated. The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as \"the gross palpable or visible/demonstrable extent and location of the malignant growth.\" 2 This volume can consist of the primary tumor (GTV primary), metastatic lymphadenopathy (GTV nodal), or another metastasis. 2 In this review, both GTV primary and GTV nodal will be evaluated due to their importance in RT planning in this cohort of patients. Other target volumes will also be appraised where described. Dosimetrically, the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) are of extreme importance. The CTV can be defined as the GTV with a margin including surrounding volumes of local subclinical involvement, edited for bone and air cavities. After the definition of the CTV planning margins are added to this volume to achieve the PTV. The PTV accounts for disparities in tumor position, size, and shape, as well as for discrepancies in patient position and beam geometries, both during and between fractions. This volume is used for the reporting of treatment doses and is considered to be representative of its respective CTV. 2 In current practice, the delineation of volumes for head and neck cancer cases is completed using images from the planning computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or in combination with other imaging modalities.\n\nWith the development of",

Leech\n## Abstract\nTarget volume delineation is performed with anatomical imaging for head and neck cancer. Molecular imaging allows the recognition of specific tumor regions. Its inclusion in the pathway could lead to changes in delineation and resultant treatment plans.\n## | INTRODUCTION\nSite and stage of the disease in addition to pathologic findings are used to establish treatment options in head and neck cancer. Surgery or radiation therapy (RT) as the sole treatment modality is recommended for approximately 30%-40% of patients with early stage disease. Both treatment approaches result in similar survival for various head and neck cancers. Additionally, around 60% of patients with locally or regionally advanced disease at diagnosis will require combined therapy. 1 Therefore, it is important to evaluate methods to improve treatment efficacy in the RT treatment chain. This review evaluates the influence of metabolic imaging in target volume delineation and its impact in RT planning.\n\nOne of the primary stages in the RT pathway, regardless of treatment site, is the delineation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). In head and neck cancer primary and nodal target volumes are routinely delineated. The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as \"the gross palpable or visible/demonstrable extent and location of the malignant growth.\" 2 This volume can consist of the primary tumor (GTV primary), metastatic lymphadenopathy (GTV nodal), or another metastasis. 2 In this review, both GTV primary and GTV nodal will be evaluated due to their importance in RT planning in this cohort of patients. Other target volumes will also be appraised where described. Dosimetrically, the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) are of extreme importance. The CTV can be defined as the GTV with a margin including surrounding volumes of local subclinical involvement, edited for bone and air cavities. After the definition of the CTV planning margins are added to this volume to achieve the PTV. The PTV accounts for disparities in tumor position, size, and shape, as well as for discrepancies in patient position and beam geometries, both during and between fractions. This volume is used for the reporting of treatment doses and is considered to be representative of its respective CTV. 2 In current practice, the delineation of volumes for head and neck cancer cases is completed using images from the planning computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or in combination with other imaging modalities.\n\nWith the development of",

Fields, E. Weiss\n## Abstract\nCervical cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. Staging and management of cervical cancer has for many years been based on clinical exam and basic imaging such as intravenous pyelogram and x-ray. Unfortunately, despite advances in radiotherapy and the inclusion of chemotherapy in the standard plan for locally advanced disease, local control has been unsatisfactory. This situation has changed only recently with the increasing implementation of magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided brachytherapy. The purpose of this article is therefore to provide an overview of the benefits of MRI in the evaluation and management of cervical cancer for both external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy and to provide a practical approach if access to MRI is limited.\n## Introduction\nCervical cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide [1]. The primary treatment of very early stage disease (IA1-IB1) is surgery and for more advanced disease (larger IB1-IVA) radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy [2][3][4][5][6]. Clinical staging based on physical exam combined with multimodality imaging is of utmost importance as it determines whether a woman is eligible for surgery and also describes the extent of the cancer for women who are not surgical candidates. \n\nDefinitive radiation therapy of cervical cancer is one of the most challenging treatment situations in radiation oncology requiring application of high radiation doses to achieve tumor control. However, the geometrical distribution of target volumes in the pelvis with a central tumor positioned directly between radiosensitive organs (bladder, rectum, sigmoid and small bowel) and involved or at risk lymph nodes neighboring small bowel are challenging for external beam therapy. High radiation doses can therefore typically not be delivered by external beam radiotherapy alone and necessitate an additional brachytherapy boost. \n\nTraditionally, the brachytherapy boost has been delivered with tandem-based applicators using 2D x-ray planning with a pear-shaped dose distribution prescribed to Point A. However, comparisons of point-based 2D planning with volumetric-based 3D planning show poor correlation between point doses and both coverage of clinical target volumes as well as doses to organs at risk (OARs), indicating a clear need for improved image guidance and soft tissue-based information to guide the planning process [7]. \n\nWith its excellent soft tissue imaging characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now plays an important role in many aspects of tumor staging, planning and delivery of radiotherapy, post treatment response assessment and surveillance [8][9][10]. MRI is well known to have superior soft tissue imaging characteristics and shows excellent results in determining local disease extent compared to physical exam and other 3D imaging techniques [11,12]. For women who are managed with primary radiotherapy, MRI also provides clear visualization of the cervical tumor in multiple planes allowing for a reliable volumetric definition of the target volume both for external beam and brachytherapy treatment planning [9].",

            "text": "Surgery has long been a cornerstone of cancer treatment in many types of cancer. Traditionally, intraoperative assessment of the resection margin is largely dependent on visual inspection and palpation of tumors, with the aid of frozen section analysis. Although preoperative imaging can provide gross anatomical information, in situ translation of these images to the operation field is challenging. With the advancement of molecular imaging technology and its clinical application, the gap between preoperative radiologic images and surgical findings has been reduced through image-guided surgery. However, the imaging probes for intraoperative visualization of tumors are not individual tumor-specific. As conventional oncology has moved toward precision oncology with genomic and biological information specific to each tumor, image-guided surgery should also shift toward tumor biology-based image-guided surgery, so-called precision surgery for cancer. In precision cancer surgery, tumors should be analyzed molecularly and genetically to select the optimal imaging probes for individual tumors before surgical resection, beyond the use of predetermined imaging probes for certain types of cancer. This will raise the likelihood of meeting the surgical goals of cancer treatment. In summary, precision cancer surgery can be defined as individual tumor biology-based image-guided surgery.",

Considering the clinical stages, patients with HCC and ICCA may be assigned to similar clinical managements [6]. However, HCC and ICCA are considered as completely different two types of liver cancer because of their distinct pathogenesis, pathological features, prognosis, and responses to adjuvant therapies [7]. Therefore, early discrimination of these two types of liver cancer contributes to designing personalized treatment strategies.\n\nComputed tomography (CT), as a common type of imaging tool, plays a major part in diagnosis, staging, treatment, and follow-up of oncologic patients. During routine preoperative evaluation in a clinical setting, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CT images helps formulate more reasonable surgical planning [8]. The contrast-enhanced CT provides higher resolution images and defines the nature of the lesion [9,10]. However, the diagnostic accuracy is dependent on variations in radiologists' level of experience, resulting in frequent misdiagnosis [11]. Despite the development of modern imaging techniques, qualitative analysis of image is not enough to make a discrimination of liver cancer, especially early-stage HCC or ICCA, which have puzzled researchers for several years.\n\nRadiomics, as a novel image processing technology, can automatically provide a large number of quantitative image features from medical images, which may be impossible for naked eyes to recognize [12,13] These image features can also be combined with machine learning algorithms to make a prediction for diagnosis.

            "text": "Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common malignant tumour worldwide [1]. The major histological type of this cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [2]. At present, oesophagectomy is still the greatest curative treatment for patients with early-stage cancer (Stage T1 and T2). Patients with advanced oesophageal SCC (Stage T3 and T4a) may undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before surgical resection. However, not all patients benefit from oesophagectomy. Patients with T4b-stage cancer or with distant metastases are regarded as having incurable disease, and these patients cannot undergo surgery but chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [3,4]. Like other malignant diseases, the option of the most suitable treatment has a remarkable effect on the prognosis of patients with oesophageal SCC. Therefore, it is crucial to determine resectability of oesophageal SCC for treatment decision making. \n\nComputed tomography (CT) is commonly used in all stages of oesophageal SCC management including diagnosis, treatment guidance, and etc. [5]. The main role of CT at initial staging is to describe structural features of primary tumour, lymph node status and identification of metastasis. As reported, the accuracy of T staging and N staging with CT was 68 and 78%, respectively [5,6]. However, the limitation of CT is to evaluate the intratumour heterogeneity of oesophageal SCC. In recent years, the attention of radiomics is increasing [7]. Its meaning is that high-through put extraction of large amount of information from images such as CT and magnetic resonance imaging enables tumour segmentation, feature extraction, and model establishment. With the help of exploration, prediction and analysis of massive image data information, physicians are assisted in making the most accurate assessment.",

Furthermore, it would be an acceptable option for reducing surgical morbidity by avoiding combined therapy.\n\nAmong the risk factors that require additional therapy after surgery, tumor size is the only risk factor that could be precisely measured by clinical imaging studies before surgery without a pathologic report, while the other factors are determined pathologically after radical hysterectomy. Thus, we selected tumor size for predicting adjuvant treatment status. Among the diagnostic imaging tools, MRI has 90% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and up to 95% accuracy for stage IB or higher with primary tumors over 1 cm in size. [21][22][23] Other imaging studies including ultrasound, CT, and positron emission tomography based on local resources provide comparable information but have limitations, especially in the detection of the primary tumor and parametrial involvement. 24 25 There are several strengths of this study. First, we regrouped all patients based on the new 2018 FIGO system. Second, it enhances counseling when suggesting treatment options of primary surgery or chemoradiation based on their tumor size for stage IB2 cervical cancer patients, as there is no high-certainty evidence between treatment options. Finally, we measured the tumor size in most patients using MRI which has high accuracy. Ideally, with the availability of non-invasive diagnostic imaging tools, it may be possible to recommend appropriate treatment options avoiding combination therapies. Limitations of the current study include its retrospective nature, the lack of data on toxicities associated with adjuvant radiotherapy, and the small number of patients. Further randomized trials are required to explore the survival impact and local control rate of different treatment modalities based on the revised stage 1B2 cervical cancer.\n\nStage IB2 cervical cancer can be treated successfully in most patients with",

Surgery or radiation therapy (RT) as the sole treatment modality is recommended for approximately 30%-40% of patients with early stage disease. Both treatment approaches result in similar survival for various head and neck cancers. Additionally, around 60% of patients with locally or regionally advanced disease at diagnosis will require combined therapy. 1 Therefore, it is important to evaluate methods to improve treatment efficacy in the RT treatment chain. This review evaluates the influence of metabolic imaging in target volume delineation and its impact in RT planning.\n\nOne of the primary stages in the RT pathway, regardless of treatment site, is the delineation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). In head and neck cancer primary and nodal target volumes are routinely delineated. The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as \"the gross palpable or visible/demonstrable extent and location of the malignant growth.\" 2 This volume can consist of the primary tumor (GTV primary), metastatic lymphadenopathy (GTV nodal), or another metastasis. 2 In this review, both GTV primary and GTV nodal will be evaluated due to their importance in RT planning in this cohort of patients. Other target volumes will also be appraised where described. Dosimetrically, the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) are of extreme importance. The CTV can be defined as the GTV with a margin including surrounding volumes of local subclinical involvement, edited for bone and air cavities. After the definition of the CTV planning margins are added to this volume to achieve the PTV. The PTV accounts for disparities in tumor position, size, and shape, as well as for discrepancies in patient position and beam geometries, both during and between fractions. This volume is used for the reporting of treatment doses and is considered to be representative of its respective CTV. 2 In current practice, the delineation of volumes for head and neck cancer cases is completed using images from the planning computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or in combination with other imaging modalities.\n\nWith the development of",

For the treatment of patients with early T stage cancers, such as stages Tis, T1a and T1b, endoscopic resection and endoscopic ablation are preferred. Patients with stage T2 or T3 stages may have a chance of undergoing radical surgery or need neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before surgery. Most stage T4a patients need preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy, while stage T4b patients should receive only palliative treatment. Therefore, accurate screening of lesions below stage T1 and above stage T4 has a decisive significance for determining the treatment plan of patients [4]. \n\nFor patients with a T stage \u2265 T4, our study shows that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, overestimation, and underestimation of HR MRI were 93.5, 94.3, 88.9, 4.8 and 1.6%, respectively. However, no significant differences were observed between high-resolution and conventional MRI techniques in these parameters. For patients with a T stage of \u2264 T1, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and overestimation of high-definition MRI were 98.4, 90, 100, 1.6 and 1.6%, respectively. The accuracy, specificity and underestimation rate of HR MRI were superior to those of conventional MRI; the sensitivity and overestimation rates were slightly different between these two techniques, and there were no significant differences in each parameter. One study reported no significant differences in the T staging of patients with \u2264 T1 or \u2265 T4 when using conventional multicontrast MRI protocols [25]. Another study reported that no significant differences were observed in the T stages of patients with \u2265 T4 among conventional MRI without DWI, conventional MRI with DWI, and MDCT techniques [29]. In the present study, there were no significant differences in the T staging results between the two imaging techniques, which may have been due to an insufficient number of patients.

Current staging paradigms focus primarily on a detailed delineation of the primary tumor in order to determine its resection capacity, and subsequently on assessing the presence of metastatic spread that would alter the surgical approach, or the mandate of non-surgical therapy. This approach is based on the assumption that the best, and sometimes the only, way to cure a cancer patient is surgical resection. Unfortunately, not all non-invasive techniques have the perfect ability to identify those primary tumors that are capable of being completely excised, nor the degree of their metastatic dissemination. However, due to relatively low costs and widespread availability, CT is the preferred scanning methodology for identifying tumors, local metastases, and spreading them remotely [10]. \n\nThis technique is often complemented by other examinations that have improved their performance in staging areas. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography, or ultrasound can be used as complementary T-stage examinations; surgical sampling of lymph nodes -for N-stage; bone scanning, MRI or ultrasound examination -for Mstage. Consequently, many patients undergoing a set of investigations are incorrectly organized based on the results obtained. Even for those who have resorted to surgery, only loco-regional metastases can be identified in resection specimens without the ability to detect distant metastases. As a result, many patients undergo unnecessary operations for pathologies that could never have been cured by surgery. In the case of restadialization, the situation is even more complicated. The sequelae of previous treatment can be difficult to differentiate from a residual cancer and the likelihood of patient rescue therapy is decreasing. \n\nThe definition of the malignant involvement degree is the foundation on which current oncological practice is based. This information defines applicable therapeutic strategies and provides a guide to the patient's prognosis. Diagnostic imaging methods, especially CT, are the primary techniques that are used to detect the cancer stage . These ways play a key role in cancer management. \n\nEach of the different methodologies used to determine the cancer stage has inaccuracies.",

Hazard ratio of patients who received surgery was more than patients who received chemotherapy. For patients with stage IV disease, the cancer has spread to other organs of the body. In stage IV breast cancer, the main treatment plan will be made up of Systemic therapy including chemotherapy, hormone therapy or combination of both.

Certain breast cancer treatments were associated with improved survival, but treatments were given to a patient based on the severity of their disease, comorbid conditions, personal preferences and other factors.

The different molecular subtypes of breast cancer could have different initial symptoms and metastatic spread and respond differently to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (15). These findings suggest that diagnostic tests, treatment strategies, and surveillance may better guide the collection of information from each patient's specific molecular subtype of breast cancer. Our study provides an additional step in that direction by identifying clinical findings between different molecular subtypes, which may help guide the preoperative use of breast MR imaging.\n\nThe cancer subtype has been shown to be a key condition to determine the correct treatment. As of today, though, the existence of axillary lymph node metastasis still determines the treatment sequence (preoperative vs. postoperative), the type of therapy (endocrine, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy), and the drugs and cycle used (16,17). Lymph node status is also helpful to estimate the prognosis and the consequent benefits of systemic therapies. The clinical approaches to the assessment and treatment of axillary breast cancer in the early stage are evolving and are guided by studies supporting less aggressive surgery (18) and more aggressive radiotherapy for lymph node-positive disease (19). However, the relationship between tumor subtypes and axillary lymph node status is A 50-year-old woman with a solitary hyperintensity in T2 lesion, with rim enhancement in Vibrant and a type II kinetic curve (plateau). A 53-year-old woman diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the luminal B subtype. The T2-weighted image shows a strong hyperintense signal inside the mass without enhancement on subtracted images, representing necrosis. The Vibrant technology shows an irregular mass with an irregular margin and a heterogeneous enhancement. Kinetic curves generated from two regions of the enhanced ring demonstrate a plateau appearance (type II curve).\n\ncurrently unclear. Previous studies have had conflicting results on the incidence of lymph node metastasis in TNBC, with no clear evidence of increase in axillary lymph node metastasis in more aggressive tumors (20,21).

            "text": "Ovarian cancer (OC) occupies a significant position among female malignancies, representing an important challenge in the public health field due to its high mortality rate and the complexity of diagnosis and treatment.the overall five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is between 30% to 40% [1].However, since ovarian cancer usually shows no symptoms in its early stages, the survival rate for stage 4 ovarian cancer drops to as low as 3% [2], reflecting the high lethality of ovarian cancer.Due to the high heterogeneity of ovarian cancer, encompassing various histological subtypes such as high-grade serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma, accurate preoperative subtype determination is crucial for guiding treatment choices and predicting treatment efficacy [3].For example, clear cell carcinoma in ovarian cancer, which has an indolent course and is predominantly platinum-resistant, leads clinicians to prefer a \"surgery-first, chemotherapy-second\" approach; whereas high-grade serous carcinoma, known for its aggressiveness and sensitivity to chemotherapy, leads to a \"chemotherapy-first, surgery-second\" preference.However, traditional subtype identification relies mainly on invasive intraoperative pathological biopsy procedures [4], which not only carry a certain risk of iatrogenic tumor dissemination but also face limitations due to tumor location or patient conditions making biopsy unfeasible.The development of imaging technology, especially multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), provides a new means for the non-invasive assessment of ovarian cancer typing.mpMRI can detail the morphological features and tissue structure of tumors [5][6][7][8][9][10][11].However, the accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer typing by MRI requires extensive expertise and is subject to the subjective influence of the doctor's experience [12][13][14][15][16].",

Conversely, the proportion of fat around the tumor is positively associated with the axillary lymph node involvement demonstrated in patients with early-stage (T1 and T2) breast cancer [19]. Aside from methodological differences, the differences between studies may also reflect obesity's complex role in cancer risk. Anyhow, cancer initiation and progression are influenced more by the tumor microenvironment [15]. To date, there has been a lack of clinical studies to explore the cut-off intervals of fat-related parameters obtained via CT images that are non-linearly related to the T stage of ccRCC. \n\nAlthough accurately determining the T stage of ccRCC before surgery is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes, the existing research results are inconsistent [16][17][18][19], possibly due to the non-linear relationship between preoperative predictive indicators and T stage. This study aims to identify and establish the specific correlated intervals of clinical and imaging indicators that exhibit a non-linear association with ccRCC pathological T stage. Through these findings, the study provides valuable insights for clinicians to accurately stratify preoperative risks and develop precise, individualized treatment plans for ccRCC patients.",

            "text": "Definition of the extent of malignant involvement is the foundation on which current oncology practice is based. This information defines applicable therapeutic strategies and provides a guide to the patient's prognosis. Diagnostic imaging modalities, particularly CT, are the primary techniques that are used to detect and stage cancer. As such, these modalities play a fundamental role in cancer management. Traditionally, stage groupings from I to IV have been used to divide patients into groups of decreasing suitability for treatment with curative intent and, consequently, worsening prognostic outlook. Recognising the limitations of previous diseasespecific staging systems, there has been a recent move towards standardising stage based on characteristics of the primary tumour (T), draining lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M) that have been determined to be of management or prognostic importance. For each tumour site category, an alphanumeric value is assigned reflecting the burden, or prognostic significance of the S54 Keynote lecture disease identified, with a higher value representing more advanced disease, or a worse prognosis. The 'T-stage' is of great relevance to the surgical oncologist, because it defines the local growth and invasion pattern of the primary lesion. Generally, the size of the lesion and its relationship to key anatomical landmarks determine the T-stage assignment. A higher T-stage is associated with larger tumours, or for those that have crossed tissue planes that would normally restrict the radial growth of tumour. For most cancers, T-stage reflects the likelihood that the primary lesion can be successfully, and safely, resected en bloc. At some stage in their evolution many malignancies develop the ability to metastasize. This can occur to regional lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels draining the primary tumour, and generally proceeds in a hierarchical manner from proximal to distal nodal sites. The extent of nodal spread is designated by the 'N-stage'. Higher nodal stage is reflective of spread to more distant nodal echelons, by larger nodal size, or both. The presence and extent of nodal involvement is critical to decisions regarding suitability for treatment with loco-regional therapies such as surgery and radiotherapy.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is among the most frequent cancers to affect women, exhibiting an average lifetime risk of 1 in 8 [1]. It is a complex disease that is of particular concern for aging women and those with family history of cancer. To combat breast cancer, and due to the availability of medical imaging technology, routine breast cancer screening is now a relatively standard practice in the developed world [2]. Most women over the age of 50, or younger at-risk individuals, are encouraged to undertake standardized annual mammograms as well as any appropriate follow-up procedures [3,4]. In cases that lead to a cancer diagnosis, medical imaging is used to evaluate, or stage, the cancer [5]. For example, due to their small size, the ideal treatment of stage I and most stage II cancers involves Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) [6]. One of the goals of BCS is to remove the whole tumor while sparing the neighboring healthy tissue. This is often accomplished by use of various medical imaging systems which permit the surgeon to localize the suspect lesion with better accuracy than physical examination alone [7]. \n\nBy monitoring neoadjuvant therapy, medical imaging continues to play a vital role in the treatment of stage III and higher breast cancers, as well as tumors which are inoperable due to location or extent [8]. The aim of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the cancer extent, or tumor size, and potentially down-stage the cancer. In responding patients this treatment course may open up new surgical options such as BCS versus radical mastectomy, or even facilitate a surgical option when there was none before. Indeed, the size of the tumor in primary breast cancer is the single most important factor determining the cancer stage [9]. As a result, the accuracy of tumor measurement can have a significant effect on selecting an appropriate follow-up action, as reflected in the widely adopted revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1, released 2009) originally prepared by the International Working Group [10]. Amongst other changes, the updated definition of \"tumor progression\" now includes an absolute increase of the largest tumor diameter by a minimum of 5 mm.",

            "text": "Patients with FIGO stage III and IV are 2.3 and 6 times at high risk of mortality compared to those with FIGO stage I.As the stage increases, the possibility of distant tumor metastasis will also increase, which results in a dramatic decrease in the life expectancy of patients.Patients with early stages (stage I and stage II) have a longer life expectancy than the diseased people with advanced stages (stage III and IV).If cervical cancer is diagnosed at the early stages it can be treated and has a higher survival rate.This result is consistent with other findings (Razak et al., 2013;Gurmu, 2018;Khalkhali et al., 2019).It should also be emphasized that there is 36.4% of patients with unknown FIGO stages in this study.The 3-year survival rate in patients with unknown stage is 56% which is slightly lower than those in stages II and III.Incomplete FIGO cancer staging may be associated with the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, which may reflect a high proportion of patients with advanced stage at diagnosis.\n\nIn this study, treatment has been classified as surgery only, radiation and/or chemotherapy, surgery combined RT and/or CT, and Palliative treatment.The results show that treatment types other than surgery only are independently associated with shortened survival and low 5-year survival rates as compared to patients who underwent surgery only.The treatment of cervical cancer depends on many factors including the type, stage of cancer, and possible side effects.Surgery may generally be given alone for the early stages of cervical cancer.The combination of radiation and/or chemotherapy and surgery combined RT and/or CT are recommended for more advanced disease (Sadalla et al., 2015;Wu et al., 2017).When patients with cervical cancer have distant metastatic disease, treatments options are often limited to either chemo-radiation or palliative treatment.The results of the study also suggest that patients with surgery only have a prolonged survival time compared to patients with other treatment types.Our analysis shows a significant association between certain types of treatment and survival in cervical cancer.It is not correct to infer a causal relationship from out data, and this association may be based on causality.",

For stages 0 and I NSCLC, surgical resection of the tumor is firstline therapy although radiation may be used instead or as adjuvant therapy if cancer is detected in the tumor margins. Chemotherapy may be provided after surgery for stage IB (having local invasion into visceral pleura) NSCLC. For stage II, extended pulmonary resection or chest wall resection may be recommended. Radiation alone or as an adjuvant may be an option, and other therapies (e.g., chemotherapy or possibly targeted anti-EGFR therapy or immunotherapy) often follow the initial therapy to lower the risk of recurrence. First-line treatment for stage III NSCLC is chemoradiation; surgery, possibly quite extensive and involving induction therapy with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, may be an option for stage IIIa tumors, whereas additional therapies for stages IIIb and c are combinations of chemotherapy and/ or therapies targeting tumor mutations (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) therapy) or immunotherapies. Stage IV NSCLC is difficult to treat; treatment options are limited to chemotherapy, targeted therapies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors), and/or immunotherapies (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors). Radiation therapy may be offered if chemotherapy is not possible or to alleviate symptoms caused by the cancer. Surgery at stage IV NSCLC may be used to treat metastases to other organs but is not curative. Treatment advances have likely helped improve cancer survival over the past two decades. In Canada, age-standardized 5-year net survival increased by 4.5 percentage points (i.e., 14.5 to 19% survival) between 2002-2004 and 2012-2014 [24]; upwards of 10 percentage points in survival have been seen in Finland and Sweden between 2000-2004 and 2015-2019 [25].",

In the present study, we classified this ratio into two categories, less than 0.16 and 0.16 or higher. \n\nCRC treatment varies based on the tumor site. This study also looked at the relation between different treatments on survival among both rectum and colon cancer patients. Adjuvant therapy showed better survival rates in colon cancer patients, while the type of treatment was not significantly related to survival in rectum cancer patients. Moghimi-Dehkordi\u201a showed that, survival rates were improved among patients who primarily underwent surgery. However, unlike findings in this study, surgery was not significant in multivariate analysis (Moghimi-Dehkordi et al., 2008). Akhoond et al. (2010) in Tehran\u201a Iran\u201a stated that, there were no significant relationships between primary treatment and CRC survival; however, primary treatment had a significant relationship with rectum cancer survival rate (Akhoond et al., 2010). Mehrabani et al. (2012) in Tehran\u201a Iran\u201a proposed that, treatment is an independent factor in survival and a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can produce remarkable results which increase the survival of patients in comparison to single therapy (Mehrabani et al., 2012). The findings of this study suggest that, surgery as the primary mode of treatment before chemotherapy and radiotherapy will lead to higher survival rates among CRC patients. \n\nFindings of this study suggest that, factors such as; age of diagnosis, site\u201a stage of tumor and lymphovascular invasion are most likely to have an effect on the survival rates of CRCs. Furthermore, adjuvant therapy in colon cancer patients increased the overall survival rate among these individuals and earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment might help increase survival.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer ranks as the third most common cancer type in men and the second in women. 1 Radical surgery stands as the sole curative treatment option. However, even when undergoing radical resection, the prognosis for locally advanced colon cancer remains unfavorable. The integration of surgery with other treatment modalities may improve outcomes. Several advanced gastrointestinal malignancies, such as rectal cancer, exhibit favorable responses to preoperative (neoadjuvant) treatment. Initial studies on locally advanced colon cancer have also indicated positive outcomes with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 2,3 The onset of lymph node metastases characterizes locally advanced colon cancer, underscoring the significance of accurate staging. Utilizing computed tomography (CT), one can assess the entire chest, pelvis, and abdomen in a single examination, facilitating the evaluation of both distant metastases and local staging. \n\nResearch has revealed that lymph nodes with a short axis measurement exceeding 8 mm are highly indicative of metastatic lymph nodes. 4,5 Conversely, numerous metastatic lymph nodes possess a diameter of less than 5 mm, and some benign lymph nodes exceed 5 mm in diameter. 6,7 Consequently, size alone does not serve as an optimal criterion to distinguish between benign and metastatic lymph nodes. \n\nIn contemporary clinical practice, radiological images are procured digitally. Texture analysis within a digital image pertains to the distribution of gray level values among pixels. Computed tomography texture analysis (CTTA) is a quantitative analytical method that provides more detailed data on the region of interest (ROI) than can be obtained through visual inspection alone. Microscopic biological changes can lead to tissue heterogeneity, and texture analysis can assess this tumor heterogeneity. Tumor heterogeneity is associated with necrosis, high cell density, and bleeding. The histogram is among the commonly used texture parameters. 8 A gray-level intensity histogram, utilizing all pixel values, provides first-order statistical information about an image. This information included the standard deviation of the histogram, mean gray level intensity, minimum, median, and maximum intensity values, percentile values of the histogram, variance, range, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, and uniformity values. 9",

Our analysis included three cancer types (i.e., lung, breast, and brain malignancies); and two imaging modalities (i.e., CT and MRI). All patients had a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of primary malignancy, and had received standard therapies including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy. We collected their pre-treatment radiological scans and, if available, tumor molecular profiles, clinicopathological and outcome data (Supplementary Tables 2-4). To rigorously assess reproducibility of our findings, we divided the 12 primary cohorts into discovery and independent validation sets as stratified by cancer types and imaging modalities. Further, we assessed the clinical relevance of the imaging subtypes in a separate cohort of 102 advanced lung cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (Supplementary Table 5).",

A total of 726 of these were pathologically confirmed with early-stage breast cancer (pathologic T stage I and II) after surgery. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those with distant metastasis were excluded. We thus retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 701 patients; 10 of these patients had bilateral breast cancer and underwent bilateral BCS, giving a total of 711 cases of BCS. This study was approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB No. B-1203/148-112). \n\nAge, body mass index (BMI), clinical T and N stage, and palpability were recorded and analyzed. Clinical stage was evaluated by physical examination and radiologic findings were obtained from electronic medical records. We classified mammographic findings into 4 categories: no visualization, mass, microcalcification, and mass with microcalcification. We identified the presence of daughter nodules by ultrasonography (USG) and non-mass-like enhancement (NMLE) by breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). From pathologic reports, we obtained the pathologic stage, histologic type and nuclear grade, pathologic multifocality, hormone receptor status, presence of DCIS and LVI, tumor border type, and resection margin width in 4 directions (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral). Breast cancer staging was based on the seventh staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/ International Union against Cancer [15]. \n\nAll operations were performed under general anesthesia by one specialized breast cancer surgeon. Palpable tumors were excised with the acceptable margin width of more than 1 cm by intraoperative palpation. Non-palpable tumors were marked by USG-guided or MMG-guided needle localization before surgery. In some cases with non-palpable tumors, specimen mammography was performed to confirm the adequate resection. The intraoperative frozen section for resection margin evaluation was not performed routinely.

            "text": "NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancer, which remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world [1,2]. In recent years, with the wide application of high-resolution spiral computed tomography (CT) screening technology, the detection rate of early lung cancer has increased significantly [3]. Surgery treatment is the first choice for patients diagnosed with early NSCLC, including stage I, stage II, and partial stage III cases. [4] e current treatment options for NSCLC mainly depend on the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging. However, patients' survival rate varies greatly at the same stage [5][6][7]. e 5-year survival rates range from 60% of stage I to about 30% of stage IIIA [8,9]. And patients with the same stage showed different rates of survival. It is of great significance in guiding clinical treatment to find independent prognostic factors. Previous studies [5][6][7] have reported that some factors may significantly promote the survival prediction of patients, such as age, race, sex, stage, and histology. \n\nNomogram is a convenient tool to predict and quantify risk for patients' prognosis by incorporating and validating some relevant factors. In some other types of tumors, nomograms that calculate numerical probability of clinical events, such as cancer-specific survival (CSS) and OS, have shown more precise prediction than the traditional TNM staging systems. At present, AJCC TNM staging is the main criterion to guide the treatment and prognosis of NSCLC patients. However, the staging could not be good to predict the survival for these patients. Other variables including age, sex, and histology may be significant independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients. \n\nerefore, the combination of AJCC staging and these variables may be better to predict the outcomes and it would be better in clinical guidance. \n\nerefore, in the present study, we built and validated the nomogram combined with several clinical variables to predict prognosis for patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery.",

            "text": "In this study, enhanced CT images labeled by senior radiologists were used to train the T stage diagnostic platform for advanced gastric cancer, and the results were verified using clinical pathological section results. The diagnosis based on continuous venous phase images of gastric cancer was consistent with the T staging based on the postoperative pathological results. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnostic platform was 0.93, and the accuracy rates for T2, T3, and T4 gastric cancer were 90, 93, and 95%, respectively, which were close to the diagnostic levels of the senior radiologists. The results of this experiment can be explained as follows. T4 tumors are relatively larger than T2 and T3 tumors and infiltrate the serosal layer; therefore, they are easily identified in CT images. In contrast, T2 and T3 tumor invasion affects the submucosa and muscles of the stomach wall, respectively, and these two layers together constitute a low-density striped layer under enhanced CT. Given that gastric cancer, infiltration is accompanied by changes in inflammation and edema, the accurate identification of the gastric cancer T stage is challenging, leading to ambiguous conclusions. There were more images of T4 tumors, and the parameters for the diagnostic platform were optimized better. There were fewer images of T2 and T3 gastric tumors than there were of T4 gastric tumors, and the optimization of the relevant parameters of the diagnostic platform was relatively poorer. The final T stage determinations made by the diagnostic platform based on continuous venous phase images were completely consistent with the postoperative pathological T stage diagnosis. These results suggest that the diagnostic platform has high feasibility, accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency. It is expected that the developed platform   will assist radiologists during screening and reduce their workload. Furthermore, the platform will help guide clinicians in determining diagnoses and developing treatment plans and enable patients with gastric cancer to receive more precise and personalized treatment. \n\nThe limitations of this study are as follows. This study was a single-center trial with limited data. The artificial intelligence platform constructed in this study can reliably determine T stages, but the T stage evaluation accuracy for single images is not ideal. Increased data volume and algorithm optimization are needed to improve the diagnostic performance.",

Methods: This retrospective analysis included 57 patients admitted to the Department of Thoracic Surgery of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between January 2015 and December 2016. Postoperative pathological results were used as the reference to verify the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating tumor T and N staging, pathological stage, and tumor length. The correlation between tumor lengths\u2014measured using magnetic resonance imaging and the surgical specimen measurements\u2014was evaluated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 64.6 \u00b1 7.2 years, with a range of 47 to 77 years. The overall accuracy rate of magnetic resonance imaging in T staging of esophageal cancer was 63.2%; magnetic resonance imaging was generally consistent in the N staging of esophageal cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging and surgical evaluation of tumor length were in excellent agreement (\u03ba = .82, P < .001), while that of gastroscopy and postoperative pathology was moderate (\u03ba = .63, P < .001). Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging is highly accurate in determining the preoperative T and N staging, pathologic stage, and tumor length in patients with esophageal cancer, which is important in deciding the choice of preoperative treatment and the surgical approach.",

In this context, the expertise of the radiologist plays an important role, especially in more difficult restaging. We expressly encourage everyone to include 3D volumetry in the standard protocol, because this new technique is already playing an increasingly important role in precise, preoperative surgery planning. \n\nDue to the multitude of therapeutic options available for the treatment of rectal cancer today, it has become an international standard to discuss each patient's findings pre-therapeutically in a tumor board comprising a multidisciplinary team (MDTmeetings).

            "text": "necessitated careful evaluation for BCS. In this study, tumor regression patterns are categorized into 2 types based on clinical interest. Type 1 regression contains pCR and unifocal regression, for which BCS is the more favored surgical plan. Type 2 regression is composed of multiple residual foci, main residual disease with satellite foci, stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD), which are appropriate candidates for mastectomy. In addition to patients' willingness and contraindications to radiation therapy [11], the tumor regression pattern is crucial for determining whether BCS is feasible for an individual patient. Accordingly, the early prediction of the tumor regression pattern is of great value and needs to be studied. The baseline prediction of tumor regression patterns identifies BCS candidates at an early phase. This enables the early modification of treatment strategies for those predicted to have a type 2 regression with great possibility after NAC. In specific molecular subtypes, e.g., TNBC, a more vigorous platinum-based chemotherapy may be adopted in non-BCS candidates to obtain a better chemotherapy response [12].\n\nRadiomics has become a novel tool for noninvasively obtaining anatomical tumor information by extracting and analyzing quantitative imaging features [13]. Dedicated MRI imaging assists oncologists in providing higher quality medical services, including more precise diagnoses [14,15], improved predictions of lymph node metastasis [16] and more accurate treatment response assessments [17,18]. Previously, Liu [19] and Xiong [20] explored the possibility of multiparametric MRI in predicting the treatment response after NAC, focusing on pCR or Miller-Payne grade. Few studies have concentrated on predicting tumor regression patterns that are closely related to surgical options. In this original article, we tried to reveal the correlations between a radiomic signature plus clinicopathological factors and tumor regression patterns.",

Presentations for which the author(s) have submitted additional material and images to EPOS TM are marked with the ! icon. Imaging plays a central role in staging cancer providing information which guides treatment decisions. This information is becoming increasingly complex due to the development of functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and to the highly sophisticated morphological and functional information derived from CT and MR imaging. Such advances together with the relentless increase in incidence of cancer and improved survival rates have led to rising demands for imaging studies. The goal of cancer imaging is to improve patient outcomes by providing a high quality service in which information derived is accurate, concise and relevant to patient management. Thus strategies in cancer imaging need to be developed, agreed and continually updated. Factors which influence strategies include trends in incidence and mortality, technological advance, the outcome of clinical and imaging research and multidisciplinary team working. The radiologist is a key member of the multidisciplinary team and should develop guidelines and protocols for individual tumours and have knowledge of patterns of tumour spread, the major staging classifications and current treatment options. The radiologist should advise on the choice of imaging modality and provide appropriate protocols for imaging studies. The cancer staging report is of critical importance and should contain a description of imaging findings and a clear, concise statement regarding tumour stage. In this presentation these issues will be addressed using examples in different tumour types to provide an introduction and overview to the Cancer Staging Categorical Course. Learning Objectives:\n\n1. To understand the impact of trends in cancer and the need for development in imaging services. 2. To review the evolving role of different imaging modalities in the multidisciplinary management of cancer. 3. To identify the need for a standardised imaging approach to staging.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries [1] . Nearly 30% of these cancers arise in the rectum [2] . It is essential to determine prognostic factors in a patient before primary therapy is instituted. If examination has been delayed, it might be too late to influence the survival of a patient because of the lost opportunity to downstage the tumor before surgery. Primary surgery is no longer the only treatment due to recent advances in oncology and availability of therapeutic options. The potential advantages of preoperative treatment are to shrink the tumor size and thereby enhance the resectability rate and facilitate sphincter-saving surgery, to reduce local recurrences, and possibly to improve long-term survival [3] . The prognosis of rectal cancer is closely related to several factors, including depth of tumoral invasion, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and involvement of the circumferential margin. Assessment of the cancer invasion through the bowel wall (T stage) remains the primary and most important factor in treatment of patients with rectal cancer [1][2][3][4] . \n\nThe TNM system for staging cancer of the colon and rectum to guide treatment and prognosis corresponds with the Dukes system: Stage \u2160, Dukes A; stage \u2161, Dukes B; and stage \u2162, Dukes C. Stage \u2163 corresponds to the presence of distant metastases [5] . Survival rates differ between T stages, and identifying poor prognostic groups within each stage has been the object of research. Early rectal cancers (T0) have a high, five-year survival rate of 95%. T3N0M0 and T4N0M0 lesions are stage \u2161. Invasion of one or two lymph nodes but no distant metastasis (T1-4N1-2M0) with any T level represents stage \u2162 disease. Stage \u2163 disease is the most severe, with distal metastasis (T1-4N1-2M1). The five-year survival rate for stage \u2163 disease is poor (Table 1). There is a marked improvement in survival with early disease.",

            "text": "Tumor location may not be important in early-stage disease but may be important in advanced disease because of its potential to invade adjacent organs. In our study, the tumor location was the fundus in 19 (57.6%) patients, the corpus in 10 (30.3%) patients, and in the corpus and neck in four patients, but no significant difference was found. \n\nChen et al. stated that tumor differentiation affected prognosis in their study [12]. In our study, it was observed that grade affected mortality. The relationship between tumor grade and the prognosis appears to be a very important factor in the prognosis of tumor histopathology, as in other cancers. \n\nIn patients with GBC who undergo radical cholecystectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection surgery, although direct invasion is not detected in the pathology specimen, GBC continues to spread by perineural and lymphatic routes. Perineural invasion has been reported to be a prognostic factor in GBC [13,14]. The presence of lymphovascular invasion is a poor prognostic factor in a wide range of tumor types [15]. In our study, the presence of lymphovascular invasion was also associated with poor prognosis. \n\nThe surgical margin was positive in three patients, all of whom died. All these patients needed a second surgery. Whipple's procedure was performed in one patient, bile duct resection + choledochenterostomy was performed in one patient, and hepatic segment 4b-5 resection + lymphadenectomy was performed in one patient. Although all surgeons performing cancer surgery state that the positivity of surgical margins is a poor prognostic factor in patients with cancer, the degree of radicality required to achieve negative margins for early-stage tumors is not clear [16]. Although all three patients with positive margins died in our study, no significant correlation was found between surgical margin positivity and mortality. More studies with more patients are needed to determine the effect of surgical margin positivity on prognosis. \n\nTNM is a frequently used staging system for patients with cancer, but the T stage is more commonly used to choose treatment for patients with GBC [17,18].",

            "text": "The discrepancy in the mortality rates highlights the importance of appropriate patient selection, preoperative risk stratification, and refinement of postoperative care. \n\nUndoubtedly, some might argue that 1-year postoperative mortality links with tumor factors and patients' factors; thus it should distinguish 1-year relapse-free mortality from cancer-specific mortality. According to our data, tumor staging accounted for the most influencing component among our nine independent variables, up to 10-point score for advanced stage in our scoring system. Advanced tumor stage always indicate more aggressive surgical extent and more devastating loss of functional reservoir, as well higher probability of early cancer recurrence. Taken together, our 1-year postoperative mortality would be relevant to either sequel of surgical complications or early cancer recurrence or both. In many circumstances, the cause of death was not easily elucidated. Nevertheless, from practical point of view, overall postoperative mortality at 1 year represents our major concern rather than relapse-free mortality. Regarding to this perspective, our integrated risk model provided a much better power (c-statistic, 0.80) to predict 1-year postoperative mortality, compared with that by either tumor factor (tumor stage, c-statistic, 0.68) or patients' factor (CCI, c-statistic, 0.59) alone. \n\nLastly but not least importantly, our risk stratification model additionally conferred good discrimination and accuracy of long-term survival of four-tier risk groups irrespective of their original cancer types and staging, even though our initial proof-of-concept was not designed for this purpose. Similar to that of 1-year postoperative mortality, long-term survivals of cancer patients after definite treatment are in large extent determined by the cancer types, tumor stage, and patients' factors such as age, nutrition, comorbidity, and frailty, which have been incorporated into our risk stratification model. Notwithstanding, the high-or very high-risk group cancer patients usually underwent less intensively radical surgery than those of standard patients, and less frequently receive adjuvant chemotherapy, as well more often discontinued treatment before completion [30].",

            "text": "Accurate imaging of the tumor and lymph nodes is essential to determine the staging of rectal cancer. In addition to clinical examination, endoscopy, and screening for distant metastases, the treatment strategy is based on pretherapeutic imaging and is currently guided by assessment of the risk of local recurrence based on European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. 5,12 In the ESMO guidelines, pretherapeutic local imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for staging. In terms of T category, using high-quality MRI helps accurately evaluate the tumor extent. For example, based on the mesorectal depth of invasion beyond the muscularis propria, cT3 rectal cancer can be further classified into subgroups (T3a, <1 mm;\n\nT3b, 1-5 mm; T3c, 5-15 mm; and T3d, >15 mm). Herein, the recommended treatment options are strictly determined according to the risk category. MRI also allows precise assessment of the status of mesorectal fascia (MRF) such as distance from a tumor to the MRF (circumferential margin: CRM) and the presence of extramural vascular invasion (EMVI). For a comprehensive evaluation of the risk category in rectal cancer without metastasis, besides T and N stages, EMVI, MRF involvement, patient characteristics, and patient preferences are considered. In rectal cancers classified as intermediate risk,\n\nwhich is \"cT3a/b very low, levators clear, MRF clear, cT3a/b in mid or high rectum, cN1-2 (not extranodal), no EVMI\", giving a short-course of nRT or nCRT can maintain the TME plane in surgery. In surgical procedures, the TME plane must be maintained. The majority of local recurrences historically reflect inadequate TME. 13 Chen et al showed a lower risk of a positive CRM and higher quality TME in patients undergoing nCRT. 14 In conclusion, nCRT can guarantee the quality of surgery.",

Accurate staging based on assessment of the extent of anatomic spread of cancer at the time of diagnosis helps to determine prognosis based on correlated survival rates. Staging also helps to guide the planning of treatment, facilitates communication between providers working in different disciplines, and serves as the basis for identifying patients who may be eligible for enrollment in clinical trials [2]. \n\nCriteria for stage assignments have been established for 47 different types of cancers. Determination of a patient's stage is based on the classification of three principal components that may be assessed at the point of diagnosis to determine a clinical stage, or after definitive surgery to determine a pathologic stage. Assignment of a tumor (T) classification ranging from T0-T4(a-d) is based on assessment of the size and extent of contiguous spread of the primary tumor. Assignment of a node (N) classification ranging from N0-N3(a-c) is based on assessment of the extent of spread of tumor to regional draining lymph nodes. Assignment of a metastasis (M) classification ranging from M0-M1(a-b) is based on assessment of the presence or absence of distant metastases (Table 1). \n\nAdditional prognostic factors that have proven to be significant in the staging of specific types of cancers include tumor grade, tumor location, mitotic rate, risk factors, histologic scores, and biochemical tumor marker levels. Compiled groupings of T, N, M, and prognostic factor classifications are sorted into tabular arrays that are stratified to define stages characterized as anatomic stages or prognostic groups ranging from 0-IV(A-C) in order of declining prognosis (Table 2).",

With an incidence of 35-78%, nodal metastases occur frequently, particularly in advanced-stage ovarian tumors (stages III-IV) (2,3). \n\nPrimary debulking surgery (PDS) is the current standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, followed by post-surgical chemotherapy (4). An improved prognosis may be expected in cases where optimal debulking (residual disease, <1 cm) can be achieved (5). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been recognized as an alternative treatment to PDS for patients with a poor performance status or apparently unresectable bulky tumors (6). NAC is expected to become a standard treatment or one of the effective treatment options for advanced ovarian cancer (7) as other phase III studies (8,9) begin to produce similar positive results. Radiotherapy may be an effective treatment modality, even in the setting of otherwise chemotherapy refractory disease (10). Tactics for the consolidation of a complete response following chemotherapy remain of great interest, but future studies are required to determine which consolidation treatment is optimal for advanced ovarian cancer (11). \n\nA previous study has indicated that the majority of females with advanced ovarian cancer, in whom tumor control was achieved, will go on to develop recurrent disease (12). Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is particularly useful for differentiating between ovarian cancer and benign disease, and for locating distant metastases. Borderline tumors may be interpreted as benign on PET/CT (13). In the present study, PET/CT technology was used to guide the use of the radiotherapy.

The tumour anatomical topography was not statistically different among the groups. Half of the tumours were proximal (52% and 50% in the ICI and control groups, respectively). The performed surgery was a lobectomy in 60% of the patients and a pneumonectomy in 25% of the patients. A minimally invasive approach was planned in 17/25 (80.0%) and 20/34 (58.8%) of the patients in the ICI and control groups, respectively. Indications for surgical intervention varied widely between groups (p < 0.001). In the control group, 20 (58.8%) patients were referred for surgery after a neoadjuvant treatment for resectable stage II-III disease, 5 (14.7%) underwent lung resection following the downstaging of initially unresectable stage III disease, 8 (23.5%) received surgery as part of the multimodal management of oligometastatic disease, and 1 (2.9%) had non-oligometastatic stage IV disease at diagnostic and underwent surgery for residual tumour ablation. In the ICI group, patients underwent surgery in the setting of a diffuse stage IV disease after prolonged partial response to ICIs (n = 8, 32.0%): three underwent surgery due to the suspicion of local disease oligoprogression, and five underwent surgery for residual tumor ablation. In seven patients (28.0%), surgery was performed after a neoadjuvant ICI treatment for resectable stage II-III disease; in six patients (24.0%), surgery was performed following the downstaging of previously unresectable disease; and four patients (16.0%) underwent surgery for the management of oligometastatic disease. \n\nWhen considering the size of the target lesion, pre-operative systemic treatment allowed for a similar reduction, with a median of 33.3% [9.0-42.8] and 26.3% [10.7-40.6] in the ICI and control groups, respectively (p = 0.56).",

Non-small-cell lung cancer is staged according to the TNM system as initially suggested by Mountain (Mountain, 1986(Mountain, , 1997 and recently revised by the International Association of Lung Cancer (Detterbeck et al., 2009). Staging is used to predict survival and to guide the patient towards the most appropriate treatment regimen or clinical trial. The most significant division is between those patients who are candidates for surgery and those who may benefit from chemotherapy, radiation therapy or both. Only patients with localized disease (TNM stage I-IIb evt. IIIA) will be candidates for primary curative surgery. For most patients with advanced disease (stage IV), palliative treatment with chemotherapy will be the only option. Thus, to allocate the patient to the correct treatment, accurate description of (i) distant metastases and (ii) mediastinal spread (N) is mandatory, whereas the T-stage will substantially influence the treatment choice only in the case of tumour invasion making resection impossible.\n\nIntegrated positron emission tomography and CT with 18",

            "text": "Surgery is the most effective strategy for treating early esophageal cancer (20). However, the rate of local recurrence with surgical treatment alone remains high (7). Accurate identification of patients prone to relapse is important for individualized treatment options. CT is a widely accepted clinical imaging modality and occupies an important position in the diagnosis, staging, and response evaluation of esophageal cancer (21). In this study, we used enhanced CT images before surgical treatment to establish a radio-clinical model to predict recurrence in patients with esophageal cancer. CT images are useful in predicting the prognosis of esophageal cancer after surgical treatment, yet poor in revealing potential tumor heterogeneity. Radiomics based on medical images is an emerging method for predicting cancer treatment response and long-term survival. To date, numerous studies have demonstrated the significant value of radiomics in clinical practice. Gillies et al. reported the great potential of radiomics to distinguish between benign and malignant diseases and predict the prognosis of tumor patients (11). Moreover, Ganeshan et al. confirmed that CT texture analysis can evaluate the heterogeneity of esophageal cancers (22). \n\nThe radiomics model in our study was established using five radiomics features and achieved a moderate result in predicting  recurrence of esophageal cancer after surgery in both the training and validation sets. Two features were wavelet-based features, similar to that reported by few other studies (23)(24)(25). Wavelet transform is a new analysis technique developed from the boundedness of the short-time Fourier transform; however, it made up for its deficiencies (e.g., it can provide a change with the frequency of the \"time-frequency\" window) and is the best solution for analyzing and processing signal time-frequency (26). The \"radscore\" integrated multiple radiomics features into a biomarker using multivariate logistic regression models. Our study suggested that the rad-score is an independent predictor of recurrence in ESCC patients after surgical treatment. In contrast to the \"N stage,\" radiomics features were the dominant factor in our radiomics nomogram (27).",

            "text": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a slow-growing skin cancer that represents the most common malignancy in the United States today, with an incidence that is steadily rising [1].Histologic subtypes of BCC can be separated into low-risk (superficial, nodular, and pigmented) and high-risk (morpheaform, infiltrative, micronodular, and basosquamous) [1].While a variety of modalities exist for the treatment of BCC, Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) is often selected for lesions that are large, histologically aggressive, recurrent, or located in high-risk body locations (Figure 1).The American College of Mohs Surgery (ACMS) has recently supported the tracking of the mean number of MMS stages per surgery as a quality improvement metric for Mohs surgeons.The goal of this initiative includes both exploring the distribution of practice patterns among Mohs surgeons and potentially identifying patterns of excessive MMS stage usage that could lead to suboptimal patient outcomes or increasing healthcare costs.While the mean number of MMS stages has previously been shown not to vary between surgeons at different stages in their careers [2], it was recently demonstrated that surgeon-specific variation does exist for mean MMS stages in general.This recent study also highlighted that surgeons in solo practice were more likely to display practice patterns with a higher number of MMS stages [3], but a notable limitation of the aforementioned study was the absence of any analysis of patient characteristics, lesion location, or histologic subtypes.",

            "text": "Localized PCa is a malignant neoplasm for which different treatment options can be selected, including active surveillance, surgery, and radiation therapy, depending on the risk classification [4,15,16]. Although it is crucial to identify the location and T stage of PCa and its grading by GG using MRI and PBx before treatment, it is currently difficult to diagnose the exact location of the tumor, as it is well recognized that PCa is a multifocal disease [16][17][18]. Among patients with clinical T1c PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy, 76% had multifocal disease [17]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine GG discrepancies between TB and pTB. Additionally, we examined the correlation between PI-RADS scores and the rate of cancer positivity in TB and pTB. In the present study, we found that 29.1% of the pTB specimens had a GG upgrade compared to the TB specimens from patients with cancer that was detected in both TB and pTB. The percentage of cases with cancer positivity in both TB and pTB was significantly higher among patients with PI-RADS scores of 4 and 5 than those with a PI-RADS score of 3. These results may indicate a higher actual tumor volume in patients with PCa who had a higher PI-RADS score, and pTB may help to solve these problems. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the size, extent, and distribution of tumors prior to treatment using current examination methods. \n\nAdditionally, the PBx specimens showed a significantly greater cancer length and tumor volume in the multifocal PCa group than in the unifocal PCa group (both p < 0.05) [17]. In 486 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, the mean volume of the largest tumor was 4.16 mL, while an average of 2.92 separate tumors were detected, with a mean tumor volume of 0.63 mL [18]. In our previous study, 372 patients underwent histopathological diagnosis and tumor volume assessment of prostatectomy specimens [19].",

            "text": "Early and accurate diagnosis of lung metastasis is a pressing clinical need. Lung cancer is prevalent and, in many cases, difficult to detect or to stage with accuracy by conventional imaging. Failing to accurately establish the existing stage of the disease severely impacts the quality of diagnosis, as the actual threshold guides the therapeutic strategy from potentially curative to palliative. Important limitations of the imaging techniques, such as at determining the presence of lymph nodes and mediastinal This could also be useful to evaluate the responses to treatment and, once validated, even be helpful for early diagnosis. \n\nTo date, the main goal of conventional LBs is identifying the relationship between the number of CTCs and the patient prognostics by either measuring progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). 28 In this way, it had been possible to determine thresholds for the CTC content from which prognostics is clearly (at least for colon, breast and prostate cancer). 16 Conversely, the correlation between the clinically defined tumor burden and extension, and the number of CTCs has never been established. Further, available LBs 29 intrinsically underestimate the number of CTCs in blood due to their antigenbased approach, which limits the count of positive events to the sole recognition of cells with epithelial receptors in their membrane (i.e., EpCAM), 22 while mesenchymal, tumor stem cells or fluctuating phenotypic CTCs 30,31 are completely disregarded. This represents a major issue. For example, a recent study conducted in patients with lung cancer undergoing radical surgery (early stages) showed that the highest preoperative clinical staging was related to the increased presence of mesenchymal CTCs, but not with epithelial cells. 32 In addition, a comparative enumeration of CTCs of the same sample obtained by using EpCAM with CellSearch\u00ae (the only FDA approved LB) and cytometry showed that the former technique only accounts for a third of CTCs events yielded by cytometry. 33",

The descriptive statistics, presented in Table 1, reveal most of the orders pertained to patients living in urban areas. The percentage of orders pertaining to females ranged from 48.6% in 2019 to 53.3% in 2021. Most of the patients included in the analysis were between 70 and 79 years of age and came from ZIP codes with median incomes between $40,000 and $80,000 per year. The percentage of orders that were for surgery ranged from a low of 11.1% in 2021 to a high of 12.6% in 2019. \n\nUnivariable Findings. No association was found between the year of the RT order and whether the order was for a patient with stage I or II versus stage III or IV lung cancer (p \u00bc 0.562). Nevertheless, there was a highly significant relationship between year and cancer stage at the time of surgery orders (p < 0.001). As found in Figure 4, the percentage of surgery orders pertaining to patients with advanced lung cancer was 47.2% in 2019, 61.7% in 2020, and 58.7% in 2021. When the two sets of orders were pooled, the relationship between year and stage was not significant (p \u00bc 0.753). \n\nMultivariable logistic regressions were run to determine the factors associated with whether a patient receiving an initial order for treatment had advanced lung cancer. The analysis was performed by pooling RT and surgery orders, and then controlling for order type, and by evaluating RT and surgery orders separately. As shown in Table 2, the pooled analysis found no association between year and the stage of cancer indicated on the order. Nevertheless, patients living in rural areas (p < 0.01) and male (p < 0.001) patients were significantly more likely to have advanced cancer at the time of their initial treatment order. Patients aged 70 to 79 years (p < 0.05) and 80 to 89 years (p < 0.001) were significantly less likely to have advanced cancer at the time of their initial treatment order than were patients aged 18 to 64 years.",

            "text": "In recent decades, there has been a significant shift towards less invasive treatment options for patients with breast cancer. Whereas radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were once the standard practices, breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is now an option for patients with early-stage breast cancer and is also a viable option for women with locally advanced breast cancer who show a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapies [113]. Furthermore, the high rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes raise the question of whether surgery could be safely avoided, especially if the local tumor has been effectively eradicated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy [114]. This could potentially minimize the complications related to surgery and anesthesia, thereby enhancing cosmetic outcomes and improving patients' quality of life. However, it remains uncertain how to accurately identify patients who have no residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who can safely forgo surgical intervention [115]. Therefore, clinical research in the last 10 years has been mainly focused on imaging and minimally invasive biopsies to exclude residual cancer. While imaging can offer an assessment of the general response to NACT, it may not be sufficient to conclusively rule out or confirm residual disease after NACT [116,117]. Several studies [118,119] that investigated the use of image-guided, minimally invasive biopsies to exclude residual cancer showed high false negative rates, with the MICRA trial presenting a false negative rate of 37% [119]. Recent studies using AI have demonstrated promising outcomes in identifying patients eligible for de-escalated locoregional treatment. \n\nAI has also been used to assess post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response, primarily centered on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Numerous studies [73,118] have employed radiomics to predict pCR after NACT. Pesapane et al. [73] evaluated the accuracy of extracted radiomics features from highly homogenous breast MRI images and demonstrated that MRI-based radiomic features improved pretreatment prediction of pCR to NACT in addition to biological characteristics (AUC 0.83 (0.73-0.92)).",

            "text": "Breast cancer is one of the leading malignancies causing death in women and accounted for 30% of new cancer cases in women in 2021 with an increase of still 0.5% per year [1]. It is called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) because of the absence of the expression of the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor. TNBC accounts for about 15-20% of all breast cancer cases [2,3]. Compared to other subtypes, TNBC occurs at a relatively low age while at the same time being highly aggressive. Patients are prone to metastasis and recurrence and have a poor prognosis [4][5][6]. The intervention of surgical and cytotoxic treatment enhances the survival rate of patients [7], data has shown that the 5-year survival rate after surgery for early-stage patients can be as high as 91% while the overall survival of patients who have metastatic TNBC is only about 18 months [8][9][10]. Therefore, the early diagnosis and timely treatment are significant with regard to a better prognosis and survival rate of this patient group. \n\nChemotherapy holds an invaluable role in controlling the progression of breast cancer. While surgery is the preferred option for most patients with early-stage TNBC, preperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in reduced tumor size, less difficult surgery and significantly lower postoperative recurrence rates which is correlated to disease-free survival and overall survival time [11]. Alternatively, chemotherapy provides the main treatment strategy for patients in advanced stages [12]. There is a rapid development of drug research for the treatment of TNBC during recent, however, the benefit of one particular treatment regimen varies from individuals due to the heterogeneity of tumor cells and expressed tumor markers [13]. Hence, real-time and accurate assessment of the treatment response would result in a more reliable judgement of chemotherapy efficiency and is therefore vital to guide further cancer treatment decisions. The most commonly used imaging tools to assess the dynamic changes of breast cancer are MRI and CT [14].",

Biopsy of omental cake, peritoneal or adnexal mass is possible. \n \nAfter surgery for ovarian cancer CT is widely used for monitoring chemotherapy, but this stems more from its use in clinical trials as a reproducible modality than from any evidence base. Another situation in which indeterminate lesions cause clinical concern is when the baseline post-surgical pre-chemotherapy examination reveals a pelvic mass but the surgeon reports complete resection. Here, resolution of uncertainty should be in the forum of a specialist multidisciplinary team meeting. Imaging has a role when management options would be altered by clarifying the nature of the mass. The distinction to be made is between residual cancer and a treatment complication[7]. The main imaging options for further assessment are MR imaging to distinguish haematoma from solid tumour and transvaginal US, which allows aspiration if infection is a clinical concern.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common type of malignant cancers and it accounts for 55% of global cancer incidence, together with lung, stomach, and breast cancer [1]. The global incidence of PC in 2012 is 1.1 million per year and accounts for approximately 7% of deaths in men [2]. PC incidence has increased to 95-116 per 10,000 persons and the incidence of death related to PC is 2 per 10,000 per person years since the introduction of prostate-specific-antigen (PSA)-screening [3]. \n\nMost patients with BC of PC are diagnosed at an early tumor stage with local disease. The primary treatment of choice for localized PC is radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). In recent years, several alternative treatment options have been approved, especially for the therapy of aggressive PC and/or metastatic spread [4,5]. BC occurs in about 30% of the patients treated, in spite of radical therapy [5,6]. BC is defined as a PSA is > 0.2 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy (RP) or > 2 ng/mL above the nadir following radiotherapy (RT) [7]. The shorter the time between primary treatment and BC is, the greater the risk for metastatic recurrence and clinical progression will be. In comparison, the longer the timeline, the higher the association of localized recurrence [4]. In this setting, PSA and PSA kinetics (i.e., PSA doubling time (PSAdt)-\"which measures the exponential increase in serum PSA over time\" [8] and PSA velocity (PSAvel)-an indication of the \"absolute annual increase in serum PSA (ng/mL/year)\" [8]) are valuable for the forecast of recurrent PC [4,9]. However the PSA alone does not indicate the localization of malignant lesions. Cornford et al. shows imaging guidelines and salvage therapy protocols after primary treatment [7]. In patients with presumptive cancer after initial curative treatment, diagnostic imaging is challenging in the evaluation of patients with recurrent PC and/or distant metastases.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers and has become the third leading cause of cancer death (Siegel et al., 2020). Stratification of CRC patients is quite essential to design more accurate and personalized treatment according to their clinical characteristics (Sorbye et al., 2007). Though the current tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system has been used for guiding treatment decisions of CRC patients for over 50 years (Nagtegaal et al., 2011), it is still inadequate for accurately assessing the prognosis of some colorectal patients, especially for patients in clinical stage II and III (Joachim et al., 2019). Even with the same clinical stage, patients may be suitable to different treatment options before and after surgery as heterogeneity of CRC (Molinari et al., 2018). Thus, prognostic analysis of CRC patients and evaluation of their preoperative and postoperative interventional treatment options are recent research hotspots. \n\nPrevious studies on the molecular basis of cancer and the discovery of cancer associated genes, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes indicates that cancer is a genetic disease (Pierotti, 2017), which determines a natural advantage for cancer survival analysis with genomics data (Walther et al., 2009;Yu et al., 2015). However, the expensive cost and long detection time severely limit its mass adoption. Radiomics is a high-throughput analysis of quantitative tumor characteristics from standard-of-care medical imaging, like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By further modeling with machine learning, radiomics can provide better clinical-decision support systems for the clinicians, like tumor diagnosis and prognosis prediction (Lambin et al., 2017). Compared with genetic detection, radiographic testing is noninvasive and does little harm to the weak patients. Especially, comparing with MRI, CT is much cheaper, and its examination results can be available faster. As a preoperative routine test for CRC patients to locate the tumor before resection surgery, CT imaging analysis can provide timely guidance on surgical procedures and postoperative treatment.",

            "text": "Other reasons why WHC participants in Idaho have an increased likelihood of late-stage breast cancer may be differences in tumor biology, delayed diagnosis, and higher rates of over-diagnosis among nonparticipants (23). \n\nOther studies have shown that information on type of surgery in cancer registries is nearly complete, whereas data on chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be incomplete (24). The surgical treatment data in this study were nearly complete and were comparable to data from the SEER program (25). In SEER registries, the percentage of female breast cancers with no surgery coded or unknown surgery codes was less than 4% for in situ and localized stage and less than 3% for regional stage. Among Idaho breast and cervical cancers in this study, less than 5% of in situ and regional breast cancers and less than 3% of localized cancers had no surgery coded or unknown surgery codes. \n\nWomen diagnosed with early-stage invasive breast cancer in the United States typically have either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery in combination with radiation therapy. Both options are equally effective in terms of survival (26). In this study, we found a significant difference in 5-year cause-specific survival from breast cancer between WHC-linked cancers and nonlinked cancers but not when stratified by stage at diagnosis. The overall difference in survival may be related to potential lead-time bias among the nonlinked cases. There may have been an increase in the time from diagnosis to survival outcome because the preclinical detection time was included in survival calculations, but there may be no change in the type or date of the outcome. The stagespecific survival results suggest that outcomes were similar for WHC-linked and nonlinked cases after diagnosis. As with our cause-specific survival results stratified by stage, Bhuyan et al used logistic regression in Nebraska to model all-cause deaths at 1 and 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis and found the adjusted odds of death did not differ significantly between NBCCEDP cancers and non-NBCCEDP cancers (12). \n\nOur results indicate that women with WHC-linked breast cancer appeared to receive the same level of care as those with nonlinked cancers.",

            "text": "Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers arise from the coelomic epithelium or modified mesothelium [1]. Surface epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian cancer [2]. Epithelial ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers have been recognized as one neoplastic entity because a lot of evidence points to a common M\u00fcllerian epithelium derivation and similar management of these three neoplasms [3,4]. \n\nEpithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage (75%), often due to its asymptomatic nature [5]. It remains the leading cause of gynecological cancer mortality, accounting for 43% of deaths [6]. \n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy following primary cytoreductive surgery forms the cornerstone of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [7]. Evidence suggests that optimal cytoreduction is the most important prognostic factor of survival [8,9]. \n\nCytoreductive surgery is more feasible in patients with early-stage disease; however, individuals with advanced-stage EOC frequently present with extensive metastatic disease. This makes primary cytoreductive surgery an aggressive procedure with potentially high perioperative morbidity and mortality. \n\nPatients with advanced-stage disease, extensive tumor burden, older age, poor performance status or medical comorbidities may benefit from neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NACT) [10,11]. \n\nImaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 18-Florodeoksiglukoz positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may provide valuable information regarding the extent of the disease, the location of peritoneal metastases, and the feasibility of complete cytoreductive surgery. This critical information aids gynecologic oncologists in determining the most appropriate therapeutic strategy [12]. \n\nAlthough CT is most commonly used to stage ovarian cancer patients, MRI and PET/CT are increasingly used in specialized centers. \n\nThis study aims to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for EOC.",

            "text": "Breast cancer stands as the most prevalent malignancy worldwide. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 2.3 million people were diagnosed with breast cancer globally [1]. It is assumed that the incidence will continue to rise and that around 3 million people will be diagnosed per year by 2040 [1]. For this reason, physicians and scientists are continually working to optimize prophylaxis, diagnostics, and therapy strategies. \n\nCrucial factors guiding therapy decisions include tumor size, grading, the proliferation marker Ki67, patient age, genetic risk factors, results of gene expression tests, and any prior medical conditions that could impact treatment choices [2]. However, the clinical tumor size (T) of invasive breast carcinoma, alongside regional lymph node involvement (N) considered within the TNM staging system, remains one of the most critical factors influencing prognosis and subsequent therapy decisions [3]. For this reason, accurate determination of tumor size and lymph node involvement preoperatively is of high importance. Moreover, the tumor subtype plays a crucial role. Especially patients with HER2 positive or triple negative tumors are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy dependent on clinical tumor size [4]. \n\nRadiologic tumor staging prior to surgery may consist of ultrasound, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography [4]. The gold standard imaging techniques for preoperative assessment are mammography and ultrasound, as they provide a high correlation with postoperatively pathological tumor size [5]. However, biological tumor features and clinical tumor size might affect the accuracy [5]. Since ultrasound is readily available, cost-effective, and minimally invasive, it is commonly employed as the initial diagnostic method for distinguishing between malignant and benign masses [6]. Moreover, the utilization of color Doppler can be beneficial in the diagnostic process [6]. \n\nHowever, all imaging methods frequently struggle to accurately differentiate between the extent of invasive carcinoma and the presence of associated in situ carcinoma or related inflammatory processes [7,8]. Consequently, they may either overestimate or underestimate the clinical tumor stage [7].",

            "text": "Cancer patients exhibit highly individual variations in treatment outcome and tumor invasiveness, the cause of which are poorly understood [1]. These variations complicate effective personalized treatment planning, which in turn is important for ensuring successful treatment outcomes. Surgical resection of tumors is often considered the most effective treatment option for patients with in situ or minimally invasive disease, but should be avoided in patients with more widely disseminated disease [1]. Patients with Stage 2 cancer where local invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissues is associated with an increased risk of tumor dissemination to the lymph nodes, can be considered either for direct surgery [1] or for neoadjuvant (i.e. pre-surgical) chemotherapy. The aim of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to down-stage/ shrink the tumor prior to surgery and eradicate small, undetectable micro-metastatic lesions, thereby increasing the chances of durable remission [2]. As such, medical treatment planning depends on an understanding of the extent of tumor dissemination. \n\nCurrently, diagnostic principles for determining invasiveness and dissemination of tumors rely on the tumornode-metastasis (TNM) staging principle. The N or M parameters, e.g. the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes or metastasis to distal organs, can however only be determined from medical imaging which require lesions of one centimeter in diameter or larger [3,4]. These techniques therefore only diagnose late-stage (node positive or metastatic) disease rather than early-stage tumor dissemination that often lead to recurrence and progression after surgery. The gold-standard for determining invasiveness is to stage the tumor itself (e.g. the \"T\" in the TNM principle) by evaluating its size and local invasiveness from medical imaging and/or examination of biopsies [5]. In addition, tumor biopsies can be evaluated for expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, leading to assessment of an EMT-score [6] and the differentiation status of the tumor cells.",

            "text": "Cancer patients exhibit highly individual variations in treatment outcome and tumor invasiveness, the cause of which are poorly understood [1]. These variations complicate effective personalized treatment planning, which in turn is important for ensuring successful treatment outcomes. Surgical resection of tumors is often considered the most effective treatment option for patients with in situ or minimally invasive disease, but should be avoided in patients with more widely disseminated disease [1]. Patients with Stage 2 cancer where local invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissues is associated with an increased risk of tumor dissemination to the lymph nodes, can be considered either for direct surgery [1] or for neoadjuvant (i.e. pre-surgical) chemotherapy. The aim of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to down-stage/ shrink the tumor prior to surgery and eradicate small, undetectable micro-metastatic lesions, thereby increasing the chances of durable remission [2]. As such, medical treatment planning depends on an understanding of the extent of tumor dissemination. \n\nCurrently, diagnostic principles for determining invasiveness and dissemination of tumors rely on the tumornode-metastasis (TNM) staging principle. The N or M parameters, e.g. the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes or metastasis to distal organs, can however only be determined from medical imaging which require lesions of one centimeter in diameter or larger [3,4]. These techniques therefore only diagnose late-stage (node positive or metastatic) disease rather than early-stage tumor dissemination that often lead to recurrence and progression after surgery. The gold-standard for determining invasiveness is to stage the tumor itself (e.g. the \"T\" in the TNM principle) by evaluating its size and local invasiveness from medical imaging and/or examination of biopsies [5]. In addition, tumor biopsies can be evaluated for expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, leading to assessment of an EMT-score [6] and the differentiation status of the tumor cells.",

            "text": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) accounts for 3% of cancers worldwide (1). The majority of HNCs are head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (2, 3). Most patients present with locally advanced disease where standard treatment is concurrent radio-chemotherapy with or without surgery first (4). Pre-treatment imaging is routinely done using computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET)/CT can be superior at identifying locoregional nodal involvement or distant metastasis and cancer recurrence at follow-up (5). \n\nMajor risk factors for HNSCC include smoking and heavy alcohol consumption particularly for oral cavity, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers, as well as oropharyngeal cancers not related to human papillomavirus (HPV) (5,6). HPV is associated with an estimated 60%-70% of oropharyngeal cancers. The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-nodemetastasis staging system (TNM8) defines HPV-related and HPV-unrelated oropharyngeal cancer as distinct entities with different tumor characteristics and treatment outcomes (6). Staging is strongly associated with treatment outcome as are other clinical factors such as comorbidity status, tobacco use, gender, and age (5). Image-based parameters such as the FDG PET maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max ) (7) of the primary tumor (8) or texture-related parameters (9) characterizing tumor heterogeneity (10) may provide additional information aiding in HNC outcome prediction. \n\nImage-based parameters can be obtained using radiomics where medical images are mined for information not readily apparent to the human eye that can improve and guide diagnostics and medical decision-making (9,(11)(12)(13)(14).",

In the United States although it accounts for only 3% of all new cancer diagnoses, it causes 8% of cancer-related deaths and is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both males and females [1] . The poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is mostly caused by an aggressive tumor biology, characterized by early development of distant metastases [2] ; resistance to chemotherapy [3] , radiotherapy [4] , and immunotherapy [5] , and rarity of actionable gene mutations [6] . \n\nDespite this grim situation, multimodality treatment can result in the long-term survival of select patients [7] . PDAC may have a predominantly localized growth pattern in about one-third of patients [8] . When there is no evidence of distance metastasis, tumor markers are low or significantly decreased, and a patient's conditions are excellent after a period of oncological treatment, surgery may become an option based on the new concept of prognosis-based resectability [9] . However, in clinical practice, relevant anatomic tumor features, such as arterial involvement, are often considered and can independently lead to the judgement of unresectability. Dealing with arterial resections makes surgery more complex and risky; however, in this modern chemotherapy and chemo-radiation era, no sound evidence supports the association between radiologic arterial involvement and worse prognosis [9] . \n\nUnfortunately, information about pancreatectomy with artery resection (PAR) is sparse and low in quality. According to the IDEAL framework for the evaluation of surgical innovation [10] , PAR is graded as stage 1 (idea) or stage 2a (development). Therefore, oncologic outcomes (IDEAL stage 3; assessment) that are key to justifying such extended procedures cannot be fully addressed at the present time. Practically, the feasibility and safety of PAR are still being determined. \n\nOur group pioneered pancreatectomy with vascular resection, with the first procedures performed in the early 1980s. After experience with vein resections, arteries were also resected [11][12][13][14][15] .",

Our result can be regarded as a kind of noninvasive risk-stratified strategies prior to surgery for nephroblastoma patients using radiomics technique, which goes beyond the ability of the human eye to identify the completely localized status in CT images. Unlike previous surveys that concerned of all stages of nephroblastoma, our current study highlighted on the detection of nephroblastoma patients at a very early stage without involvement of renal capsule, sinus vessels, and lymph nodes. These patients can not only undergo complete tumor resection, but also have the potential to perform nephron sparing nephrectomy. Therefore, we developed a new method to divide patients into localized group and non-localized group noninvasively before operation, so as to guide the personalized treatment of nephroblastoma. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between radiomic features and the involvement of renal capsule, sinus vessels, and lymph nodes of nephroblastoma has not been evaluated previously. \n\nAt present, lots of studies have shown that radiomic technology has the power to predict metastasis of different diseases. For example, one of our previous studies showed that radiomic features could effectively predict preoperative lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer (13). In that study, tumor radiomics and LN radiomics were integrated to build an effective non-invasive tool to guide treatment decision-making in gastric cancer, which was notably useful in patients with T2-stage, diffuse subtype, and moderately/well differentiated gastric cancer.",

The increasing role of radiologists in the multidisciplinary management team of patients with rectal cancer is recognised and the role of MR imaging for stratifying these patients into a differentiated treatment is consolidated. Nowadays, with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), advanced rectal cancer shows phenomenal response with downstaging to small tumours (ypT0-2) confined to the wall. In 15-20%, no residual tumour is found in the resection specimen (complete response, ypT0N0). The paradigm shift in treatment has been further tailoring the treatment for the good responders after CRT, aiming at organ saving treatment options with less morbidity, such as local excision. Although still controversial, a wait-and-see policy (omission of surgery under close monitoring) is being advocated for the complete responders. This shift in treatment has consequences for radiologists.\n\nOur major challenge will be to provide tools that can help in precise selection of these patients. The challenge will not only be restricted to an accurate evaluation Fusion imaging is not new. However when combined with volume imaging and navigation, it becomes a very strong tool broadening ultrasound as well as CT clinical applications for both diagnostic and interventional practices and in particular in guiding therapy without or reduced ionising radiation. Currently available systems have been shown to be useful in a) the US tracking of liver and renal lesions for detection, characterisation of difficult/occult lesions and follow-up following therapy, b) in the guidance of biopsy and ablation of occult liver or renal tumours as well as c) a much needed training tool for interventional clinicians. A practical work-flow through various fusion and navigation systems for the clinical applications as well as their current benefits, limitations and future developments will be reviewed. Preoperative staging of rectal cancer implies detailed recognition of tumour extent, providing the basis for multidisciplinary team (MDT) treatment planning. The role of diagnostic imaging continues to increase in this setting. There are technological advances",

            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Recent data from GLOBOCAN reveal that lung cancer ranks third in terms of age-standardized incidence rates among all cancers and is the leading cause of cancer-related death [1]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases [2]. The clinical staging of NSCLC guides treatment selection, and surgical resection is widely utilized as a traditional therapy. Surgical resection is considered the optimal treatment approach for patients with clinical stage I and II disease [3]. For those with clinical stage III disease, surgical intervention also demonstrates broad applicability [4,5], particularly in stage IIIA cases [6]. However, surgical treatment is generally not recommended for patients with clinical stage IV disease due to the presence of distant metastases [7]. Therefore, extensive preoperative evaluations should be conducted to identify distant metastases and accurately determine the clinical stage prior to considering surgical intervention [8]. \n\nPleural metastasis in NSCLC is classified as distant metastasis, and it is classified as M1a according to the 8th edition of the TNM Classification. It is characterized by pleural enhancement and thickening on preoperative imaging, making it challenging to differentiate from benign pleural diseases [9]. Consequently, the identification of pleural metastasis is often delayed until surgical intervention. The incidental discovery of pleural metastasis intraoperatively poses considerable challenges in devising and implementing appropriate surgical strategies. Surgeons are confronted with decisions regarding whether to resect the main tumor, perform only a pleural biopsy, conduct systematic lymph node dissection, or resect the pleural metastatic lesions. These complex clinical dilemmas necessitate further research and evidencebased investigation to inform optimal management approaches. \n\nThis study is a retrospective study designed to collect comprehensive clinical data from patients with pleural metastasis detected intraoperatively. The primary objective was to analyze the potential relationship between prognosis and various indicators in this specific patient cohort while aiming to propose an optimal surgical strategy.",

For local disease, the standard treatment is surgical resection; however, at least 20% of patients are unable to have surgery due to medical comorbidities. Current practice for non operable, early stage, non-small cell lung cancer involves external beam radiotherapy. A significant number of patients who undergo radiotherapy develop tumour recurrence and have relatively low 5 yr survival rates of 10-30%. Traditionally, patients who had tumour recurrence had limited treatment options consisting of chemotherapy or other methods of palliation. The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate survival, local tumour regression and complication rates for percutaneous CT guided thermal ablation (radiofrequency or microwave ablation) performed on patients for tumour recurrence post external beam radiotherapy at a tertiary cancer hospital.",

Since stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) does not have any lymph nodes or distant metastasis, the individual difference is mainly in T stage, that is, the maximum diameter and the location of tumor (the visceral pleura infiltration). However, as UyBico et al [1] and Adebonojo et al [2] reported, tumor and patient specific factors vary even within the same disease stage, creating a heterogeneous population of patients, each with an individual prognosis that requires consideration of patient-and tumor-specific factors for best estimation. Owing to the high heterogeneity, there is a quite limitation in treatment planning and prognosis predicting only based upon TNM stage and pathological type. It has been reported that the patients with resectable disease and poor prognostic variables might benefit from adjuvant therapy. [3] The latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [4] define patients at high risk for poorly differentiated cancer, vascular invasion, visceral pleural invasion, tumor size >4 cm, wedge resection, and incomplete lymph node sampling.

Surgery and radiation therapy are curative treatments for localized disease, offer potential cure for biochemically recurrent disease (i.e., salvage radiotherapy or salvage prostatectomy), and can offer durable control in the oligometastatic disease setting. To the extent PSMA imaging can identify micrometastatic disease and reclassify clinical stage, patient selection for local therapies can be expected to improve. Further, the success of radiation largely centers on accurate identification and encompassing of disease within a radiation field in the setting of localized or salvage radiation, or to precisely target disease with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Conventional imaging has low sensitivity and low specificity for detection of prostate cancer spread. Thus, PSMA imaging is being explored to determine its role in early stage disease, including for accurate assessment of intraprostatic tumor burden, with higher PSMA uptake previously shown to be associated with histological identification of focal lesions (39,43,44). This can guide focal SABR escalation at these sites (45,46).",

            "text": "A significant decrease in tumor size post-therapy is often a positive indicator, suggesting that the cancer is responsive to the treatment [9]. This responsiveness can lead to less extensive surgical interventions. \n\nmrTRG offers critical insights into the probability of achieving a complete cancer resection with clear margins, a key factor in determining local recurrence and overall patient survival. Despite its value, the concordance between mrTRG and pTRG (pathological TRG) remains limited. Consequently, mrTRG cannot substitute for pTRG. There is a growing need for further research to enhance mrTRG's effectiveness in identifying patients eligible for non-surgical treatment options and complementing pTRG for more nuanced postoperative risk stratification [10]. Additionally, the volume reduction rate might influence the surgery timing. Patients who show rapid response to treatment may undergo surgery sooner, whereas those with slower response rates may benefit from extended cycles of chemotherapy or radiation before undergoing surgery. \n\nFrom a predictive standpoint, both the tumor volume reduction rate and mrTRG can guide the surgeon in discussing long-term outcomes with the patient. Data suggest that patients whose tumors significantly reduce in volume may have a better prognosis, which can be vital to post-operative care and surveillance strategies [11]. \n\nThis nuanced understanding of tumor biology requires sophisticated imaging and analytical techniques, with modalities such as MRI playing pivotal roles in volumetric analysis [12]. Moreover, integrating these measurements into predictive models and treatment algorithms can customize therapeutic strategies, optimizing the balance between efficacy and toxicity for each patient. \n\nThe adoption of tumor VRR and mrTRG as standard prognostic tools in rectal cancer care faces several challenges. These include variability in measurement techniques, timing of assessments, and differences in interpretation among observers, which can affect the accuracy and consistency of these metrics. The underlying biological reasons why some tumors respond better to treatment while others resist it are not fully understood. Considering these challenges, our study aimed to explore the relationship between tumor volumetrics and tumor regression grade, as assessed by MRI, in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.",

Not all stage N1c patients should receive chemotherapy, which is recommended for positive LN patients. Patients aged < 70 years, those of black race, and those with Vol:.( 1234567890 stage T1-2 showed similar curative prognoses when receiving surgical treatments alone, as when receiving a combination of surgery and chemotherapy (all p > 0.05). Thus, patients without other high-risk factors may be able to forgo chemotherapy in clinical practice. Using the results of multivariable analysis and VIMP values obtained through RF, factors that have a significant impact on OS were selected to establish a nomogram model for predicting one-, three-, and five-year OS rates. The new model had better discrimination than the AJCC's TNM model (C-index: 0.728 versus 0.667, respectively, p < 0.001; IDI = 0.074, p < 0.001), as well as good consistency and higher clinical benefit. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network's guidelines suggest that TDs are related to the N stage. However, some studies have suggested that patients with stage N1c can be incorporated into stage N1b or stage N2a groups, in terms of their survival 20,21 . Some studies also show that the N stage can be further subdivided Nevertheless, the exact effect and mechanism of TDs in prognosis remain unclear. Ueno find that the most prominent feature of TDs is undifferentiated cancer cell microscopic clusters in adipose tissue, which is similar to tumor budding at the invasive front of the main tumor 23 . Numerous studies have shown that tumor budding may be the early stage of invasion and related to LN infiltration and poor prognosis 24,25 . Therefore, TDs may also indicate that a tumor is more invasive.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Radical hysterectomy and lymph node dissection are extensive procedures with severe post-operative morbidities and should be avoided on patients with low risk of recurrence. Still, due to lack of good prognostic tools, radical surgery is performed on most patients with early stage cervical cancer, leading to overtreatment and unnecessary morbidities. The recent International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system accepts the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to physical examination. Currently, 3 Tesla (3T) MRI is available widely and, due to its high soft tissue contrast, can provide more useful information on precise estimation of tumor size and metastasis than can physical examination in patients with cervical cancer. Therefore, this imaging modality can help gynecologic oncologists to determine whether minimally invasive surgery is necessary and can be used for early detection of small recurrent cancers. Abstract According to the recent International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, Stage III cervical cancer indicates pelvic or paraaortic lymph node metastasis. Accordingly, the new FIGO stage accepts imaging modalities, such as MRI, as part of the FIGO 2018 updated staging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging modality to estimate the size or volume of uterine cancer because of its excellent soft tissue contrast. As a result, MRI is being used increasingly to determine treatment options and follow-up for cervical cancer patients. Increasing availability of cancer screening and vaccination have improved early detection of cervical cancer. However, the incidence of early cervical cancers has increased compared to that of advanced cervical cancer. A few studies have investigated if MRI findings are useful in management of early cervical cancer. MRI can precisely predict tumor burden, allowing conization, trachelectomy, and simple hysterectomy to be considered as minimally invasive treatment options for early cervical cancer. This imaging modality also can be used to determine whether there is recurrent cancer following minimally invasive treatments. The purpose of this review is to highlight useful MRI features for managing women with early cervical cancer.",

            "text": "The proposed combined model, which merges the HCR and DLR features, can noninvasively and robustly characterize intratumoral heterogeneity from medical images at different levels [25,26] , which helps improve the performance of the model. Moreover, combining high-dimensional features can provide further details regarding cancer, making the model more sensitive for disease diagnosis and prediction [13,27,28] . Furthermore, the clinical and radiological features can provide a more comprehensive description of tumor characteristics. The present study achieved a better diagnostic performance by combining DLR features with clinical-radiological features that complemented the image features with more information and made the model more robust by limiting the features extracted from the image [29] . This combination took realworld clinical practice into account and could provide meaningful guidance for clinicians who can benefit patients. \n\nAlthough the accuracy of diagnostic imaging in determining the stage of PDAC has been improved, OPM that were not detected preoperatively can still be observed intraoperatively [30,31] . Surgery is not a first-line treatment option for these patients, and both postoperative complications and delayed chemotherapy may worsen prognosis [6] . In addition, diagnostic staging laparoscopy, the recommended examination for the diagnosis of peritoneal metastasis, is invasive and should be used selectively [8] . Furthermore, the application of neoadjuvant therapy eliminates preoperatively undetected micro-metastases, prevents recurrence, prolongs progression-free survival and overall survival, and currently plays an important role in the treatment of PDAC [32] . All in all, pretreatment noninvasive prediction of OPM can avoid unnecessary surgery and allow for a more individualized diagnostic and treatment plan, but it is still a challenge [6,33] . The present study attempted to construct a DLR-combined model to predict OPM in patients with PDAC. Our DLR model can noninvasively detect OPM in patients with PDAC prior to treatment, therefore, not only avoiding inappropriate surgery, but also screening more patients suitable for diagnostic staging laparoscopy and neoadjuvant therapy treatment.",

            "text": "Liver cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer globally in 2018, with about 841.000 new cases and 782.000 deaths annually (1). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death (2). Liver metastases, which are secondary liver cancer, may occur in the early stages of gastrointestinal malignancy because of hematogenous spread through the portal venous system (3,4). The morbidity and mortality of these populations with liver cancer increase significantly. \n\nGiven the complexity of liver cancer and many potentially useful treatments, the most appropriate treatment option should be selected for each patient at each tumor stage. Energy-based tumor ablation has become a widely accepted treatment option for patients with early-stage liver cancer in recent years. Several energy-based ablation technologies are currently available, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), laser ablation, and cryoablation. Before and after energy-based ablation, cross-sectional imaging is necessary to plan the ablation and to assess treatment response. The most used modality for follow-up is multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) due to its broad availability, robustness, and high reproducibility (5). RFA and MWA aim to achieve irreversible cellular injury and cellular death, leading to eradicating the target tumor (6). During the ablation treatment, the segmentation is a crucial first step that provides a series of quantitative measurements, including volume, shape, localization, and the proportion for liver or lesion. \n\nHowever, precise segmentation of liver tumors or the ablation zone is still challenging in planning ablation before the procedure and assessing treatment response after the procedure. Some studies have assessed the ablation treatment by subjective estimations and manual segmentation (7)(8)(9). This kind of method is time-consuming and suffers from low consistency and reproducibility. It heavily depends upon prior human knowledge, and it requires people with high-level of skills to accomplish such tasks.",

This approach is of the aim to improve the breast cancer prediction through microscopy procedure. \n\nA remarkable number of breast cancer research has taken advantage of the predictive performance in decision tree to determine the best pathway of treatment for patients. Generally, patients with early-stage breast cancer require two different types of treatment which are local treatment (direct treatment to the affected breast) and systemic treatment (whole-body treatment). Local treatment includes radiotherapy and surgery. For surgical option, the patients might opt for either mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) or lumpectomy (removal of the cancer area along with the margin of normal tissue around it). After the surgical procedure, systemic adjuvant therapy will be given which involve either endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy or radiation therapy [74]. These treatment options are to eliminate the remaining tumor cells that might be responsible for breast cancer recurrence. Despite having the same aim, the treatment options must be considered thoroughly to tailor the best treatment that fits the patients' needs. This is in light of the fact that each treatment pathways has a different mechanism of action, risk and side effects to each breast cancer patients. This is when decision tree can be implemented in assisting physician to select for the best treatment plan. To guide the choice, decision tree can be employed by using the data based on previous study and literature to build decision models that compare the considered treatment plan. Hence, the best treatment option could be indicated from the model that provide the best treatment outcomes based on patients' need. Similarly, a document portrayed a systematic review of the use of decision tree in treatment guidelines for radiotherapy in lung cancer [75]. \n\nConsidering the use of decision tree in deciding the best treatment plan, the extensive use of the algorithm can be observed in cost-effectiveness analysis of breast cancer treatment. This is in the point of fact that decision tree is a method that assists in providing good options, ultimately for decisions that consist of high risks and costs [76].",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer diagnosis and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. A few years ago, the majority of lung cancers were discovered in advanced stages, where surgery could not determine any indication and patients were referred to a chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy program with a dismal prognosis. However, the recent introduction of the Lung Cancer Screening Program and the improvement of radiological items with the spread of Low-dose Computed Tomography machines are making possible the diagnosis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in its early stages. Unless lung cancer treatment is extremely varied, surgical resection remains the mainstay for early stage and even for locally advanced disease [1,2]. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) has radically changed the world of thoracic surgery; it has achieved optimal results compared to open approaches [3]. In fact, it ensures less post-operative pain, and it is associated with a reduction in chest tube duration and length of hospital stay (LOS), thus reducing patient morbidity and mortality. For a long time, lobectomy has represented the gold standard for the treatment of all potentially resectable Medicina 2023, 59, 2079 2 of 9 lung tumors, while segmentectomy was considered a lung-sparing option in cases where lobectomy was not feasible because of the patient's fragility. Nowadays, pulmonary lobectomy and segmentectomy still represent the two main types of anatomical resections for primitive tumors. In particular, segmentectomy has recently been demonstrated to be a valuable alternative to lobectomy, not only in unfit patients. In fact, it has achieved great results in terms of local disease control and disease-free survival for tumors less than 20 mm in diameter [4][5][6]. Moreover, it has demonstrated an acceptable intra and post-operative complications rate. However, it is well-accepted that anatomical segmentectomy is a more challenging procedure compared with lobectomy, because the anatomy of lung segments is more complex. Indeed, it requires a careful assessment of each patient's anatomy, which may have numerous variations and anomalies in bronchovascular structures.",

The median follow-up time was 905 days. \n\nAll participating patients had IP as an underlying disease, and 101 (84%) of these patients had an idiopathic etiology. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) alone was used for 116 patients (97%); the other four patients underwent open surgery combined with VATS. Lobectomy was performed in 83 patients, segmentectomy in 23 patients and wedge resection in 14 patients, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the pathological staging of the lung cancer; 46 (38%) of the patients were at stage IA. The undetermined pathological staging was mainly because of wedge resection. Table 2 summarizes the histological types and mutation status of the 128 lung cancers. The most common histological type was squamous cell carcinoma, accounting for 67 (52%) of the cancers. Activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were detected in four patients among 111 tested cancers. \n\nTable 3 compares characteristics between the patients who experienced AE of IP and those who did not. Eight patients (7%) experienced postoperative AE of IP. The median time from surgery to the AE was 16.5 days, and the median survival time after surgery of these patients was 176 days. Compared to the other patients, the patients who developed AE of IP tended to have undergone lobectomy (100% vs. 67%, p = 0.047) and to have lower percent predicted vital capacity (%VC; 88.0% vs. 100%, p = 0.044). \n\nPostoperative lung cancer recurrence was experienced by 29 (24%) of the patients. Best supportive care was the most frequently chosen option for these patients (used for 17 patients, 59%), followed by chemotherapy (10, 34%), and other options (2, 7%).

            "text": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the primary screening method for early detection of lung cancer and can reduce mortality in certain high-risk populations (1,2). To standardize the image reporting of pulmonary nodules and management of pulmonary nodule patients, the American College of Radiology developed the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) based on the characteristics of pulmonary nodules (such as size, attenuation, and growth pattern) to stratify the risk of lesions (3). Category 4X is a special category of lesions that exhibit additional features and imaging findings and represents the highest risk of malignant tumours, with a malignancy rate greater than 15% (4,5). In addition, most of the lung cancer detected by screening belong to pulmonary nodules with a Lung-RADS score of 4X, which makes these nodules highly clinically significant (6). \n\nAmong Lung-RADS 4X pulmonary nodules, the most common pathological type of benign pulmonary nodule is tuberculous granuloma, which is challenging to distinguish due to its similar imaging features to lung cancer (7). Accurate identification of the two can guide clinicians to make reasonable and effective treatment and prevent patients from receiving overtreatment or losing the optimal treatment time due to delayed treatment (8). Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common pathological type of peripheral lung cancer, and visceral pleural invasion (VPI) is an important prognostic factor and staging index (9). For patients with early-stage peripheral lung adenocarcinoma, the five-year survival rate is 86% for patients without VPI, compared with 57-70% for patients with VPI (10). In addition, in the presence of VPI, extensive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy can significantly improve patient survival outcomes (11)(12)(13). Therefore, accurate differentiation of pathological types and VPI of Lung-RADS 4X peripheral pulmonary nodules before treatment can aid in stratification, and maximize the guarantee that patients receive reasonable and accurate treatment. \n\nSeveral previous studies have reported that the relationship between peripheral lung cancer and the pleura plays an important role in further risk stratification of lesions (9,14).",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death [1]. Rectal cancer, which makes up nearly one-third of colorectal cancer cases [2], is often difficult to treat and carries a much higher risk of local recurrence. \n\nBecause of this high risk, radiotherapy is often added to the standard treatment for rectal cancer, surgery. By the early 1990s, on the basis of evidence from the Research Paper www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy had become widely used in the US [3][4][5]. More recently, the availability of endorectal ultrasonography and new magnetic resonance imaging technologies has improved preoperative staging, making neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) the current standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer [6][7][8]. However, many patients with locally advanced rectal cancers still do not receive NCRT because their disease is understaged on preoperative imaging studies. \n\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (ART) can reduce the risk of local recurrence by about 37% compared to surgery alone [9] and is therefore recommended for patients with T3, T4, or N+ rectal cancer [10][11][12][13][14]. However, it is not yet clear whether this translates into increased survival durations. The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NRT) and ART on diseasespecific survival (DSS) in patients with rectal cancer in a large population-based retrospective data set from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. We also sought to determine whether tumor stage affected the relationship between NRT or ART and DSS.",

            "text": "With rising incidence rates, AEG is gradually gaining recognition [1,3]. The Japanese gastric cancer guide regards 4 cm as the threshold for the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) tumors to suffice direct surgical treatment, mainly based on the relationship between TS and LNM. This is the fact that when TS is larger than 4 cm, the EGJ line is unrecognizable. The larger TS had a greater the probability of LNM. This relationship has been confirmed in early-stage AEG [18]. However, for T1-T3 stages, the relationship between TS and LNM in Siewert type II AEG was unknown. To our knowledge, this study is to define the relationship between the TS and LNM in T1-T3 stage Siewert type II AEG, based on SEER data. \n\nTS is a risk factor that has clearly been shown to greatly affect the prognosis and recurrence of liver cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and others [19][20][21][22][23]. In gastric cancer, TS was not only related to prognosis, but also LNM and the depth of invasion, which provides a reference to guide and narrow down treatment options [16,17]. This indicates that TS is of great significance when guiding clinical diagnoses and treatments in various cancers, however, regrettably, there are a limited number of studies that have illustrated the relationship between the TS and LNM, prognosis, and treatment methods, in AEG. Fang et al. [24] retrospectively analyzed the pathological data of 180 Siewert type II and III patients with AEG. Their results found that TS was an independent risk factor, and they believed that larger TS worsened prognosis due to the greater likelihood of a deeper tumor invasion. In the study, TS was grouped as 5 cm without explanation, and thus the basis for this grouping was ambiguous. Hoshino et al [25] retrospectively analyzed 48 patients with Siewert type II EGJ cancers and found that the EGJ line could not be clearly distinguished with a TS greater than 4 cm.",

            "text": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, 1,2 with an estimated 572,000 new cases and 509,000 deaths in 2018, 2 causing serious impacts on human health and quality of life. 3 CT scans are crucial for the examination of EC, and accurate segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and 3D morphological quantification of EC on CT images are crucial for the accurate T and N stage diagnosis of EC, the choice of a treatment strategy, and the prognostic assessment of treatment. 4,5 Esophagoscopy is the gold standard for EC diagnosis 6 and can confirm the diagnosis of EC. However, it is invasive and expensive, and it cannot be used to T and N stages diagnose EC, and it cannot show the 3D shape and spatial relationship between cancer and adjacent structures. EC can also metastasize in a multidirectional way via lymph nodes in the para-esophageal, neck, abdominal cavity, and mediastinum, 7 so for the diagnosis of EC, metastasis of lymph nodes also needs to be identified. \n\nMultirow CT or CTA images have recently been discovered to increase the precision of EC TNM stage diagnosis. 8,9 We are committed to developing automatic segmentation models for EC to lessen the workload of doctors and increase effectiveness because manual segmentation of EC is hard and time-consuming work and prone to segmentation errors. \n\nCurrently, tumor volume measurement is mostly used to predict T-stage in colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, which helps in accurate diagnosis and prognostic assessment, but it is less used to predict T-stage in EC. [10][11][12] In our previous study, based on CTA 3D reconstruction of EC, we can clearly observe EC's location, 3D shape and spatial relationship. We also found that EC's volume, major and minor axis are significantly predictable factors to the T-stage diagnosis of the tumor before surgery. 13,14 In traditional acknowledge, N stage diagnosis is determined by metastatic lymph node's number.",

            "text": "Reportedly, 3D CT planning is superior to the conventional 2D planning as the latter overestimates the tumor dosages but underestimates the OAR dosages [10,11]. Recently, 3D MRIguided BT planning for cancer of the cervix has been developed, which has the potential to optimize the primary tumor dosimetry and reduce the dosages to critical normal tissues [2,7,12]. For primary tumors and adjacent soft tissues in the pelvis, MRI appears to be better than CT for more accurate estimation of tumor coverage [13,14]. Therefore, 3D MRI-guided BT is recently more recommended in the cervical cancer treatment. \n\nUntil now, although the 2D and 3D BT planning for cervical cancer has been compared, such analysis still needs to be further verified in detail (e.g. based on the tumor size, morphology characters, invasion into the adjacent organs). The purpose of this study was to comprehensively compare the tumor dose coverage and dosages to adjacent OARs between the 3D MRI-and 2D point A-based BT planning for patients with cervical cancer as well as determine the potential benefits of 3D image-guided plan optimization. This study showed that compared with 2D point A-based BT planning, 3D MRI-based planning generally significantly increased dose coverage in big tumors, eccentric tumors and tumors invading adjacent tissues, while diversely affected the dosages to OARs. The difference in the target dose coverage and dosages to OARs between small and big cervical tumors was different in 2D and 3D BT planning. This study indicates that 3D MRI image-guided BT planning exhibits advantage over 2D point Abased planning in a complex way, generally showing advantages in the treatment of cervical cancer except small tumors.",

            "text": "Using HBCR data, we identified all patients with cancer who started their cancer therapy at the same hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2017 because health services utilization data were available for the hospitals who diagnosed cancer. We then identified the patients with lung (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition [ICD-O-3] morphology code C34), breast (C50), colorectal (C18-20), stomach (C16), head and neck (H&N) (C00-C14), or cervical (C53) cancer based on the topography codes of the ICD-O-3.1. We chose five cancers (lung, breast, colorectal, stomach, and cervical) with the highest incidence in Japan [7] and excluded male breast cancer because their stage distribution often differs from that of female breast cancer [8,9]. We also included H&N cancer because the diagnostic delay for this type of cancer is known to be associated with higher mortality [1]. Prostate cancer also has a high incidence; however, we did not target prostate cancer for our analysis because active surveillance is sometimes chosen as a treatment option; in which, TTI is not problematic. Patients with stomach and colorectal cancers who underwent endoscopic resection as their first treatment were not included because the date of diagnosis and resection can often coincide, making it difficult to determine the TTI, and this treatment modality is unique to gastrointestinal cancer. We excluded patients registered for multiple cancers and those who did not undergo chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy, given that the TTI for respective cancer types is difficult to determine for such patients. To target the patients who underwent curative-intent treatment, we excluded those patients with stage IV disease from the study. However, patients with stage IV(M0) H&N cancer were included because they are often indicated for curative-intent treatment. Patients who started their first treatment on the day they were diagnosed, as well as those who waited more than 180 days before the start of their first treatment were excluded from the study. For stage information, we used the pathological stage from the Union for International Cancer Control unless this information was unavailable, in which case we used the clinical stage instead.",

            "text": "While in vitro studies aim to uncover the mechanisms of disease progression, ultimately these findings should improve clinical practices. Currently, reliable methods to track ovarian cancer progression are limited. CA125 is not always indicative of recurrent disease and is increasingly coupled with additional imaging and clinical exams. Fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG)/PET/CT scans have emerged as a particularly advantageous tool. These scans detect glucose metabolism, an indicator of the Warburg effect often associated with advanced and metastatic stages of cancer. We have recently shown that adaptation to harsh microenvironmental conditions in early cancer stages selects for the Warburg phenotype. 97 In addition to tracking disease progression, another critical aspect of ovarian cancer management is determining the most appropriate surgical approach. Currently, there are no standards for identifying which patients are candidates for primary debulking surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery. However, the Fagotti scoring system has been proposed to guide providers in decision making. This model calculates a predictive index value based on tumour distribution seen on diagnostic laparoscopy. A score greater than eight has little to no chance of complete surgical resection with primary debulking surgery. 98 hanges in the Fagotti score after neoadjuvant treatment correlates strongly with resection status, PFS and OS. 99 ence, incorporating FDG/PET/CT scans with the Fagotti scoring system and CA125 monitoring can provide a more comprehensive approach to managing ovarian cancer. These tools should be implemented early to identify resistant disease or aggressive nodes, select the optimal course of treatment, and monitor for effective management. \n\nCurrent clinical practices are limited in their ability to treat heterogeneous ovarian cancers. They often fail to eliminate cell populations that do not respond to therapy or have the capacity to evolve and escape treatment. These populations, known as minimally residual disease, consist of cancer cells that survive initial treatments and later expand, leading to relapse. 95 This is particularly concerning because they often fail to respond to previously used therapies. Over a decade ago, cancer therapy designs were based on oncogene addiction, an idea where tumours rely on key oncogenes for survival.",

            "text": "Background: Non-image-guided forms of radiotherapy (external radiation therapy [XRT], including superficial radiation therapy [SRT]), have been used to treat non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) for over a century. More recently, image-guided superficial radiation therapy (IGSRT), which allows visualization of tumor configuration and depth throughout treatment, is being used to treat NMSC with high local control (LC) rate. Methods: Two recent studies report the results of IGSRT. Further, the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has published a comprehensive review of studies examining XRT/SRT outcomes of which four high-quality, recent, evidence-based, large (with more than 100 cases), United States (U.S.) based studies exist. Using information from these six studies, we employ logistic regression to compare basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) treatment outcomes between IGSRT and XRT/SRT. Findings: IGSRT local control (LC) was statistically superior to each of the four large non-image-guided radiotherapy studies individually, collectively, and stratified by histologic subtype. Interpretation: IGSRT LC is superior to non-image guided radiotherapy LC for the treatment of early-stage epithelial cancers. We propose that because lower recurrence rates result in less economic, social, and psychological burden on patients, IGSRT could be considered the preferred standard for the non-surgical radiotherapeutic treatment of early-stage NMSC with LC comparable to Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).",

            "text": "The detection of low-risk prostate cancer (PCA) has increased as cancer screening programs and detection mechanisms have improved. 1 Since the number of patients diagnosed with low-risk PCA has increased in recent times, the ability to precisely localize tumor foci within the prostate has become an important goal. Accurately identifying the positions of PCA tumors would increase staging accuracy, improve patient selection for active surveillance (AS), and facilitate treatment planning. 2 A growing body of evidence indicates that AS is the most suitable approach for a select group of men with low-risk PCA. 3 However, pretreatment diagnosis of low-risk PCA is often difficult since PCA is a multifocal, heterogeneous disease. 4 Moreover, the current criteria used to define low-risk PCA cannot reliably determine whether AS is the best treatment option for each patient. Some studies have reported that even low-risk PCA may demonstrate disease upgrading or upstaging. 5,6 Even known indicators of the severity of PCA, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics or initial biopsy results at the time of PCA diagnosis, do not reliably predict adverse pathology when men are monitored by AS. 7 Therefore, imaging techniques have played an increasingly important role in the management of localized PCA. However, no imaging modality presently available is able to measure the actual cancer volume. 8 Moreover, no current criteria for AS reliably includes clinical staging based on the imaging modality. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could help predict the diagnosis of low-risk PCA. Focusing on nonvisible tumors on multiparametric MRI of clinical stage T1c, we assessed the clinicopathological relationships between the biopsy and pathological results.",

            "text": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases [1], is one of the most common and fatal cancer types worldwide [2]. While the most common treatment strategy for NSCLC patients is surgery, a high probability of tumor recurrence following surgical resection typically results in a bleak prognosis [3]. In fact, early-stage NSCLC patients (Stage I, II, IIIA) who underwent resection surgery have recurrence rates of 40% (stage I), 66% (stage II) and 75% (stage IIIA) [4][5][6]. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict NSCLC relapse is extremely critical considering that, as cancer progresses, the five-year survival rates decrease sharply, from 40% of stage I patients to only 1% of stage IV patients [7,8]. Thus, the ability to identify patients with a high risk for recurrence following surgical resection is critically important because it allows clinicians to determine which patients may benefit from adjuvant therapies [9], and thus create more effective personalized treatments. \n\nHowever, for patients with NSCLC, crafting treatment strategies that include adjuvant therapies is difficult [10,11]. Of the several common factors known to be associated with NSCLC relapse in early NSCLC, such as tumor size (T-stage), nodule involvement (N-stage) and smoking history [12][13][14], the tumor node (TN) staging system is traditionally used as a postoperative prognostic factor [15,16]. The TN staging system provides medical professionals with a framework for understanding the prognosis, treatment options, and value of new interventions allowing for the best possible care for lung cancer patients [17]. However, because tumor size is determined qualitatively, accurate TN staging can be limited due to human error [18]. The TN staging system is further limited in predicting clinical outcomes due to the lack of a clear rank order by stage [19].",

Other statistically significant differences within the Aboriginal cohort compared to non-Aboriginal included less surgery among older cases, more reports of radiotherapy among distant/unstageable cases and increased reports of no treatment among Aboriginal males and those living in areas of most disadvantage or geographic remoteness. Female breast cancers in both cohorts were relatively more likely to receive surgery and systemic and radiotherapy.\n\nThe relationships between receiving treatment and the concurrent effects of stage at diagnosis and Indigenous status are summarised in Table 3. Localised/not localised stage at diagnosis did not predict receipt of any of the treatment modes. However, being Aboriginal was associated with lower likelihood of receiving each treatment mode. Indeed, Aboriginal cases had twice the odds of receiving none of the three treatment types compared to      Table 4 summarises the risk of cancer death using subhazard ratios (SHR). Using cases among Aboriginal people in non-remote settings as the reference group, Baseline Model 1 indicates those cases experienced a lower risk of cancer death than Aboriginal cases from geographically remote areas, but significantly greater risk than non-Indigenous cases from non-remote areas. Cancer stage was highly predictive of the risk of cancer death, as was the presence of 4 or more comorbid conditions [10].\n\nWith minor variations in SHRs, Indigenous status by remoteness and 4 or more comorbidities contributed in a similar manner to each of the subsequent models derived. Stage at diagnosis also contributed a main effect within each model. We found no further interactions between Indigenous status and stage at diagnosis or treatment mode on the risk of cancer death.\n\nHowever, interactions were found between stage at diagnosis and the relevant treatment mode. For example, in Model 2 cases with localised disease at diagnosis had significantly lower risk of cancer death than those in the reference category with more advanced stage of disease and who also received surgery, SHR = 0.34; 95%CI = 0.25-0.47. In turn, cases who had more advanced disease but did not receive surgery experienced twice the risk of cancer death, SHR = 2.05; 95%CI = 1.48-2.85 compared to those in the reference category. Similar effects were observed in Model 3 (systemic therapy) with lower risk of cancer death among cases with localised disease compared to the reference",

In the era of precision medicine, it is of great signi cance to determine the risk factors for postoperative recurrence or death in stage IA invasive lung adenocarcinoma (IADC) for guiding clinical practice and designing clinical trials for high-risk patients. It can also guide the selection of adjuvant treatment for high-risk patients with early-stage lung cancer after surgery. \n\nThe International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) proposed a new classi cation of lung adenocarcinoma in 2011 [5] , which was also adopted in the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) classi cation of lung tumors [6] . The main pathological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma include lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary and solid types [5,6] . So far, there have been studies showing the effects of the new classi cation on postoperative survival. Micropapillary and solid predominant subtypes indicate the poor postoperative outcomes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma [7] . However, it is di cult to re ect the factors in uencing the prognosis of p-stage IA IADC.",

            "text": "The lack of real-time intra-operative disease identification to allow a complete resection, detection of involved LNs, and eradication of micrometastases is the leading cause of incomplete tumour removal and subsequent regrowth [18]. Current pre-operative imaging modalities lack the sensitivity to detect small lesions [19,20]. There is an unmet clinical need to enhance intra-operative cancer detection and improve the rates of complete cancer resection in PDAC. \n\nA solution would be to personalise surgery by stratifying the resection's radicality to the stage. Given the limits of the available imaging modalities, several researchers are concentrating on cutting-edge methods for intra-operative cancer detection. This provides various benefits and the option of minimising resection while achieving negative resection margins [21]. Firstly, intra-operative cancer detection could help identify patients with LN micro-metastases undetected by standard imaging techniques [22]. Secondly, it could eliminate the difficulties faced when distinguishing tumour tissue associated with the increased adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Thirdly, it would be helpful in specific clinical situations, such as staging laparoscopy, to identify peritoneal metastases, liver metastases, and extra-pancreatic LNs. \n\nThis review examines the limits of current imaging techniques in PDAC staging and addresses novel and emerging technologies for intra-operative tumour localisation. Additionally, the benefits and downsides of these techniques are evaluated, and their possible translation to clinical practice is discussed.",

            "text": "According to the lung cancer registry at our institution, 359 patients underwent complete surgical resection (R0) between January 2013 and December 2013. Inclusion criteria were (a) no separate tumor nodules in the same lobe; (b) follow-up exceeding 6 months after tumor resection; and (c) standard preoperative contrast-enhanced CT obtained with one dedicated CT scanner, with both 1-mm and 5-mm thickness images. To perform a per-patient basis analysis of the tumor, patients who had separate tumor nodules were excluded. After excluding patients with CT obtained with a different scanner (n = 81), prior surgery for lung cancer (n = 14), stage III or IV (n = 61), separate tumor nodules (n = 7), and insufficient follow-up period (n = 2), 194 patients (81 males and 113 females) with pathologic stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma were selected (Fig 1). The final pathologic stages were graded based on the 7 th edition of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [19,20]. In the present work, we analyzed quantitative CT features using a dedicated CT scanner to avoid potential variability from the use of different CT scanning parameters. Standardized preoperative staging work-up using chest CT, bronchoscopy or CT/fluoroscopic guided biopsy, and PET/CT were performed in all patients. Tumor recurrence, quantitative CT characteristics, maximum standardized uptake value on PET/CT, and pathologic data were carefully reviewed. In addition, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings were analyzed and compared in patients with and without tumor recurrence.",

For non-locally advanced stage III rectal cancer, short-course radiotherapy (SCRT), consisting of neoadjuvant therapy (5.0 Gy x 5 fractions)) is a valid option. Both these approaches are typically followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery [4][5][6]. \n\nFor radiotherapy treatment planning, the superior softtissue contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to computed tomography (CT) images [7] provides excellent visualization of both the tumor target and organs at risk, improving the simulation and treatment technique [8,9]. This enables the safer delivery of higher doses to the target and better sparing of organs at risk (OARs), namely the rectum and bladder. However, the modifications or displacements of target volumes and OARs, relative to the radiation beam frequently occur because of patient positioning and different filling and pressure effects from OARs [10]; these can result in significant dosimetric changes because of the sharp dose gradients between the target and normal tissue. Unfortunately, such anatomical modifications may cause underdosing of target organs and/or over-dosing of OARs. \n\nImage-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) is commonly used to reduce setup errors in patient positioning and in the inter-fraction organ motion [11]. Typically, the correction parameter involves moving the treatment table to re-position the shifted target point to the isocenter of the treatment device.",

Intra-operative frozen sections were used to assist in clear margins. \n\nThe Surgical Pathology Specimens (SPS) were postoperatively evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic examination. All three dimensions of tumor were applied to the ellipsoid formula to determine its volume. 30 The primary tumor measurements in the SPS were considered the gold standard for the study. The tumor pathological stage (pTNM) was defined based on SPS analyses, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria (AJCC). 31 he 3DS images were obtained only in a second period of the study (stage 2) to meet the requirements of the local Ethics Committee. The 3DS images were obtained from MPR images using the InVesalius software 3.0 version, according to recommended procedures (https://www.cti.gov.br/invesalius). Segmentation and contouring of the tumors were performed manually (Fig. 2B). The images of the skeleton were performed automatically by selecting the proper thresholds (Fig. 2C) to obtain 3D images of the tumor along with bone structures (Fig. 2D). The computer software magnified and rotated images with bone transparency adjustment (Fig. 2E) to highlight tumor topography (Fig. 2F).",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men worldwide, with almost one million new cases each year. However, the exact definition of high-risk prostate cancer remains unclear. A consensus on a clear definition is still needed, which currently translates into a lack of specific patient counseling and clear treatment management (Bastian et al. 2012). The actual risk stratification of prostate cancer is based on the probability of recurrence after local treatment. Some pre-treatment parameters have been analyzed as potential prognostic factors. PSA and Gleason score are considered as pretreatment parameters that, when combined with clinical stage, are used to provide a more accurate prognosis of the results in these patients. \n\nProstate cancer is currently classified as stages T1 and T2 in located PCa and locally advanced prostate cancer is classified into stages T3-T4. Today, according to the EAU (European Association of Urology) and AUA (American Urology Association) guidelines, radical prostatectomy is a reasonable treatment option for selected PCa patients with cT3a disease, Gleason Score 8-10, or PSA > 20 (Bastian et al. 2012). However, a better knowledge of the natural history of the disease and developments in treatment options have resulted in more sophisticated risk stratification systems (Marciscano et al. 2012). It is clinically important to identify patients with high-risk PCa early on because they will benefit the most from curative therapy (Bastian et al. 2012). Currently, systemic therapy has a limited role in the treatment of localized prostate cancer, although adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has yielded significant improvement in disease-free survival for men with high-risk features treated with definitive radiation and a significant overall survival advantage for men with Gleason scores of 8 or higher (Dorff et al. 2011). \n\nThere are two primary types of treatment: watchful waiting and radiotherapy. However, neither carries 100% accuracy. Furthermore, no randomized studies have compared more intensive treatments, such as radiotherapy or surgery, with watchful treatment.",

            "text": "The global cancer statistics 2020 reported that breast cancer has become the first cause of cancer worldwide, with over 2.26 million new cases (1). With the number of patients with breast cancer increasing annually, comprehensive breast cancer treatment has become increasingly crucial. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer is a systemic chemotherapy conducted before surgery or radiotherapy and is an essential component of the overall treatment for breast cancer. Its main purpose is to decrease tumor load before surgery, reduce tumor stage, and convert inoperable tumors into operable ones. As a result, female patients with breast cancer who require total mastectomy may manage to preserve their breasts and improve their overall treatment outcomes and their quality of life (2). Furthermore, studies have shown a strong association between pathological complete response (pCR), overall survival, and disease-free survival (3). Therefore, early prediction of pCR has become the focus of clinical attention.\n\nNumerous studies have proposed various methods, including mammography, digital breast tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to assess the response to NAC in patients with breast cancer. MRI is effective in predicting pCR after the completion of NAC (4), and the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) technology is more reliable than other methods. In addition, a growing body of research has shown that DCE-MRI can reflect tumor microvascular perfusion and vascular permeability, providing the possibility of quantitative evaluation and is thus helpful in predicting the final outcome after completion of NAC for breast cancer (5,6).\n\nRadiomics was first proposed by Lambin (7) and involves extracting massive features from segmented medical images. By transforming medical images into mineable data for quantitative and qualitative analyses of tumor heterogeneity, radiomics is widely used to provide effective references for the management of various oncological diseases, particularly in differential diagnosis, subtype analysis, treatment option selection, prognosis evaluation, and efficacy assessment (8)(9)(10). Moreover, radiomics can be combined with clinical information, histopathological and molecular features, and multiple imaging features to provide more comprehensive information. Previous studies have shown that radiomic features obtained using DCE-MRI have good predictive ability for pCR after",

Local treatments mean surgery for colon cancer, and this is usually used for stages 0 and I. This surgery sometimes involves colonoscopy and sometimes by cutting the loop that has the cancer cell to remove all the affected area, and this is called a hemicolectomy, partial colectomy, or segmental resection. If the whole colon is removed [5] (ACSMECT, 2020), in some patients, the surgeon might reattach the healthy portion of the colon to the rectum. This procedure is called colostomy, and it needs to open in the abdominal wall the remove the waste [7]. However, new robotic techniques or enhanced visualization help improve the high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the surgical field, enabling surgeons to perceive fine details more clearly. This increased visibility makes it easier to spot important structures, cut them precisely, and inflict minimal damage to healthy tissues.",

            "text": "L ung cancer is the leading cause of death by malignancy worldwide. The current TNM staging system as proposed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classifies the disease invasion status by components including tumor characteristics, status of involved lymph nodes, and distant metastasis conditions. 2][3][4] Therefore, the TNM system can only provide predictive information about disease-free and overall survival for different stages but is considered the most important prognostic factor in surgically resected patients. 5 any prognostic factors have been identified in previous literature. From the view of tumor cell metabolic capacity, high standard uptake value (SUV max) of the tumor area may be related to poor survival among stage I to III disease. 6,7 Among patients who received anatomic resection and were identified as pathologic stage IIIA, pathologic tumor classification and mediastinal lymph node involvement have been identified as independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival. 8 In addition, patients without lymph node involvement or with lower metastatic lymph node ratio have been correlated to better survival. 9,10 From the view of microscopic presentation, actual tumor size, [11][12][13][14] visceral pleura, [15][16][17][18][19] and angiolymphatic invasion status [20][21][22] have been correlated to patient's survival. However, these studies have only identified the prognostic factors that correlated to survival for specific stages without further analysis of disease relapse. In addition, the effect of postoperative treatments was not included for analysis. We have had no ideal survival prediction model that could be utilized as survival prediction and reference for selection of follow-up imaging tools. ][25] In this study, we summarize all clinico-pathologic factors, including patho-histologic characteristics of cell type, lymph node involvement, and postoperative treatment, and analyze the effects on disease and overall survival. We also attempt to further analyze the relationship between predictive survival model and disease relapse.",

Metastasis can also occur via the blood, either secondarily from lymphatics such as the thoracic duct, or directly through invasion of vessels by the primary tumour. These metastases to distant tissues generally develop in a haphazard manner, although many tumours display characteristic patterns of spread. For example, prostate cancer spreads primarily to bone, whereas colorectal cancer most often spreads to the liver. The presence of remote metastases and, sometimes, the extent of this spread, are designated by the 'M-stage'. \n\nAlthough most tumours are simply rated as M0 or M1, some tumours have sub-classification of the M1 grouping to reflect disease burden, thereby differentiating between patients with limited and, perhaps, locally treatable metastases from those with widespread dissemination requiring systemic therapy or palliation alone. In a few tumours, such as oesophageal cancer, remote lymph node disease is also designated as M1, reflecting the inability to cure this disease by local therapies alone, and the poor associated prognosis. \n\nIs TNM stage based on CT a valid basis on which to select patient management? \n\nThe utility of TNM status at presentation as a guide to management planning has been primarily validated by its ability to stratify survival of subgroups of patients with a given type of cancer. However, it needs to be recognised that prognostic implications of a given TNM stage are related to the accuracy of staging methods used, the actual therapies employed at the differing stages of disease, and the effectiveness of those therapies. Of these factors, the accuracy of the staging method has a compounding effect, since stage generally determines the selection and delivery of therapies of significantly differing efficacy. TNM stage is usually determined from a composite of clinical examination findings, the results of various investigations including imaging, and pathology, when it is available. Each of the various methodologies used for determining cancer stage has inherent inaccuracies.",

Current modalities to track cancer evolution or response to therapy include procedure-based, imaging-based, and biopsy-based technologies. Procedure-based biomarkers, such as screening colonoscopy for colon cancer or endoscopy for esophageal cancer, are effective in cancer detection but are resource-intensive, require specialized staff and equipment, and are not widely accessible [2][3][4]. Imaging-based biomarkers, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography (PET) are non-invasive, repeatable tools that can be readily employed for the screening, surveillance, and assessment of therapeutic response. However, the performance of imaging devices considerably varies and protocols are not standardized [5]. Furthermore, imaging is dependent on the expertise of the interpreting radiologist: secondary interpretation of imaging-based biomarkers by sub-specialized diagnostic radiologists has been shown to uncover management-changing discrepancies in 18.6% of cases [6]. Additionally, many imaging modalities are expensive and not widely accessible in resource poor environments, thus limiting their utility as a universal approach to guiding clinical cancer care [7]. Tissue biopsy is currently the gold standard biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating tumor genetic, proteomic, or transcriptomic data; however, it is invasive, painful, carries potential adverse side effects, and is subject to false-negatives from sampling or pathologic interpretation [8]. Thus, the development of biomarkers of evolving tumors that can overcome these barriers represents a critical need in the monitoring and management of cancer [9]. \n\nThe ideal biomarker is easily acquirable, non-invasive, operator-independent, and broadly relevant across a variety of diseases and treatment stages.",

            "text": "They observed that pT and pN stages and other factors, such as age, primary site, radicality, type of surgery, preoperative radiotherapy, number of examined lymph nodes and adjuvant chemotherapy, were associated with mPC risk [33]. The model was externally validated and modified in a subsequent study by the same study group [12]. In another study of 1720 patients, Nagata et al. presented a prediction model combining T category, N category, lymph node count, CEA, obstruction and anastomotic leak after surgery [30]. \n\nCompared with the previously established prediction models, an advantage of our model is that it can efficiently select high-risk patients among those with pT4 colonic cancer with five simple common clinical-pathological variables (pT4a/b, pN, histological type, CEA level and tumor location), which can be easily obtained within one week of the operation (right after the pathology report on the resected primary tumor; the timing depends on the institution). The physician can use the results of the model to discuss treatment strategies with patients before administering adjuvant chemotherapy or other treatment. We also validated the performance of Segelman's and Nagata's models based on our data; Harrell's C-index scores were 0.548 and 0.535, respectively. This poor performance did not surprise us because those authors included more patients with pT1-pT3 colonic cancer in their studies. This indicates that the factors for mPC might be different between pT1-pT3 patients and pT4 patients; therefore, a prediction model for the pT4 colonic patients is essential. On the other hand, we considered various models for model selection to optimize discrimination ability. We estimated the baseline hazard by cubic splines to smooth mPC recurrence-free survival. The benefit of curve smoothing includes noise elimination, which contributes to reducing the Brier score, enhancing predictive accuracy. We also applied a data-splitting method to avoid overfitting. Furthermore, we developed mPC risk calculator based on the final Cox model, but the risk scores are not convenient for medical decision-making. We used classification and regression trees to classify into high-risk and low-risk groups.",

            "text": "The peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was introduced by Paul Sugarbaker to describe peritoneal carcinomatosis, initially for colorectal cancer and mesothelioma. PCI illustrates the distribution and the volume of carcinomatosis. In colorectal cancer, PCI shows a linear relationship with overall survival and affects postoperative quality of life. It is not generally recommended to operate on patients with colorectal carcinomatosis with PCI over 20. Previous studies on PCI in ovarian cancer are few and heterogeneous, suggesting cutoffs for surgery from 10 to 25, and since many of the studies were conducted, surgery has become more extensive. However, in most studies (both prospective and retrospective) on ovarian cancer, the FIGO stage is used to categorize the spread of the disease. The FIGO stage is quite a blunt tool with the majority of cases in stage IIIC, including patients with carcinomatosis ranging from a single peritoneal implant C 2 cm in the upper abdomen to massive carcinomatosis. The assessment of PCI gives a more specific measurement and can be used both in preoperative imaging for deciding primary treatment (surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and in studies to compare populations.

            "text": "During the past 2 decades, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the most accurate staging modality for locally advanced rectal cancer. Dual phased-array, thin-section MRI has been shown to be the gold standard for rectal cancer staging, with sensitivities of 7191% and specificities of 78100% in detecting depth of penetration and lymph node metastasis [1215] . MRI addresses many of the limitations of CT, such as definition of depth of invasion through the rectal wall into local structures, and extension into presacral space and mesorectal circumference, which are high-risk areas for recurrence (Fig. 2). MRI-defined tumor volumes for radiotherapy planning of rectal cancer could result in smaller, shorter, more accurate tumor contours, lying further from the anal sphincter [16,17] . This would facilitate dose sparing to the normal tissues and escalation to the target. \n\nONeill et al. [18] reviewed imaging and planning data for 10 patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer. Tumor volume and location were compared for sagittal pretreatment MRI and planning CT. CT consistently overestimated all tumor radiologic parameters. Estimates of tumor volume, tumor length, and height of proximal tumor from the anal verge were larger on planning CT than on MRI. Tumor volumes defined on MRI are smaller, shorter, and more distal from the anal sphincter than CT-based volumes. Tan et al. [19] compared the volumetric and spatial relationships of gross tumor volume (GTV) derived from CT (CT-GTV) and GTV derived from MRI (MR-GTV) to determine the utility of multimodality imaging for radiotherapy treatment planning in rectal cancer. Fifteen patients with T3-stage rectal cancer were accrued in this study. All patients underwent a diagnostic MRI and CT and MRI simulation. Data sets were coregistered. Tumor volumes were analyzed for 3 anatomical subregions (sigmoid, rectal, and anal). The mean CT-GTV/MR-GTV ratio was 1.2. The tumor volume ratios for the rectal subregion were well correlated.",

A diet high in saturated fat may also play a role. \n\nMeasurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in blood and digital rectal examination (DRE) are offered for early detection of the disease for men at average risk beginning at age 50 years and for men at high risk beginning at age 45 years. \n\nTreatment options for prostate cancer vary depending on age, disease stage, potential side effects of the treatment, and other medical conditions of the patient. Surgery, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy can be used for treatment of early-stage prostate cancer. Hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these can be used to treat metastatic disease or as supplemental therapies in early-stage disease. Watchful waiting without immediate treatment can be offered in some older patients who have limited life expectancy or less-aggressive tumors. Follow-up after radical prostatectomy Follow-up after radiation therapy -Summary -Acknowledgments -References Today, more than 90% of prostate cancers are diagnosed during early stages. Over the past 20 years, the 5-year survival rate for all stages increased from 67% to 100% [1]. This improvement in 5-year survival rate is mainly due to early diagnosis. \n\nThis article reviews the role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), which can be used to guide biopsy, is the most frequently used imaging technique in cancer detection. For determining the extent of disease, CT and MR imaging are the most commonly used modalities; bone scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET) have roles only in advanced disease. Currently, the role of imaging in prostate cancer is evolving to improve disease detection and staging, to determine the aggressiveness of disease, and to predict outcomes in different patient populations.",

            "text": "The role for surgery in the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is nicely discussed in the manuscript by Gemenetzis et al. published in the Annals of Surgery (1). As the authors acknowledge, therapeutic selection, sequencing and surgical resection were based on expert consensus in their multidisciplinary clinic. The excellent results achieved by these authors reflect their experience and expertise; both qualities which may be hard to replicate in smaller volume programs. The challenge in treating patients with LAPC is demonstrated by the inability of most clinicians and radiologists to develop an objective working definition of LAPC. Even professional societies and consensus panels struggle to agree on a computed tomography-(CT) or magnetic resonance image (MRI)-based definition of LAPC (2)(3)(4). In the absence of an objective, reproducible clinical staging system for localized pancreatic cancer (PC), it becomes very hard for the individual medical or surgical oncologist to translate published treatment results to the newly diagnosed patient. \n\nIn an effort to add objectivity to the staging of localized PC, we have published a CT-based system utilizing critically important tumor vessel relationships (5)(6)(7). We defined two anatomically distinct disease patterns summarized in Table 1. In general, patients with LAPC type A have greater than 180 degrees of tumor-vessel contact but less than 270 degrees, which allows for dissection (with tumorartery separation) or resection of the celiac and/or common hepatic artery (CHA), or dissection of the perineurium from the adventitia of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). If the patient with localized, non-metastatic PC is deemed acceptable for surgery (based on performance status, medical co-morbidities, social support), the clinical disease stage determined by cross-sectional imaging at diagnosis will accurately predict the likelihood of completing all intended neoadjuvant therapy and surgery (7)(8)(9)(10). To the extent that surgery is necessary (even if not sufficient) for long term survival, this information is invaluable for patients, their family, and their treating physicians.",

            "text": "Cancer is the leading cause of premature death in Europe and the USA and one of the most important public health issues worldwide [1,2]. Depending on the tumour type and stage, different treatment options are available. Surgery is the main treatment modality for most solid tumours, often integrated in a more extensive (neo-)adjuvant treatment strategy. Surgical resection is generally aimed at complete macroscopic and microscopic removal of the cancer. However, inadequate resection of the tumour (i.e. presence of cancer cells at the margin or < 5 mm from the resection surface) frequently occurs. The worldwide extent of this problem is illustrated in Table 1, showing the percentage of positive surgical margins for the most common cancer types. Although a clear surgical margin may not be pivotal in all cancer types (e.g. during debulking procedures for brain tumours [3]), it is the main prognostic factor for survival in most types of cancer. Moreover, inadequate surgical tumour resection most often warrants adjuvant treatment, which is associated with increased morbidity and costs. During the operation, an oncologic surgeon takes into account all relevant clinical information that is available, including cancer type, tumour differentiation, and preoperative imaging reports. However, the actual surgical cut is based on subjective tactile and visual assessment of the tissue to determine which tissue needs to be excised. Although the primary aim is to completely excise the tumour, precise margin delineation is imperative in many delicate areas where wider resections inevitably lead to increased morbidity and loss of functionality.\n\nOver the past two decades, important advances have been made to improve assessment of surgical margins by the introduction of intraoperative imaging techniques. Besides frozen section analysis, several optical methods have been studied to perform intraoperative margin assessment in surgical oncology, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) [36], photoacoustic tomography, terahertz imaging, second harmonic generation, confocal microscopy, fluorescence (lifetime) imaging, autofluorescence imaging (AFI), narrow-band imaging, hyper-spectral imaging, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy (RS) [37][38][39][40]",

            "text": "This study is the first to report the relationship between preoperative MRI and additional assessment and primary surgical treatment in subgroups defined by breast cancer mode of detection (interval versus screen-detected). Previous studies have examined MRI use and outcomes in women with occult disease (29), however, these studies have not reported findings for the clinically distinct interval cancer cases. Women with an interval cancer diagnosis were more likely to receive MRI. Although all women receiving MRI were more likely to receive additional imaging and biopsy, we found that a higher proportion of women with an interval cancer had a mastectomy than women with screen-detected cancers, regardless of MRI use (21% versus 13%). Even after adjusting for patient and cancer characteristics, women with interval cancer were over 60%, more likely to have a mastectomy compared to women with a screen-detected cancer. Many previous studies have accounted for cancer histology, stage, grade, tumor size, and other prognostic cancer characteristics when assessing utilization of imaging, biopsy, and surgical management for breast cancer in relation to preoperative MRI. However, our results indicate that even after adjustment for these key prognostic factors, women with interval cancers were different from those with screen-detected cancers in relation to preoperative MRI and surgical treatment. Women with an interval cancer were more likely to have a mastectomy regardless of whether or not they had a preoperative MRI, suggesting there may be other factors related to interval cancer that impact surgical management. For example, the anxiety level for a woman with an interval cancer may be higher than a woman with a screen-detected cancer because her cancer was missed on a previous mammogram. Hence, although these women have more advanced disease and surgical options may be limited, women with interval cancer that do have surgical options may opt for a more extensive surgery to relieve her anxiety about risk of recurrence.\n\nInterval breast cancers represent a challenging subgroup to study, given the relatively small numbers represented in existing population-based data. However, given the poorer prognosis among these women, this subpopulation is important to consider when evaluating the utilization and outcomes of breast imaging modalities such as MRI. Published literature on preoperative MRI has reported the conundrum of a preoperative modality that is optimal for detecting subclinical cancer foci",

            "text": "Esophageal cancer is a malignant tumor that still has a poor prognosis. There are two distinct histological types, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, which predominate in East Asia and Western countries, respectively. For patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC), neoadjuvant treatment including neoadjuvant chemotherapy [1] or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) [2,3] has been shown to improve survival compared to surgery alone. Therefore, preoperative treatment followed by surgery has been the worldwide standard of care. However, the superiority of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or NCRT has not been determined at this time. On the other hand, definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been positioned as a treatment option for patients who wish to receive organ-preserving treatment or who are medically inoperable, because the results of definitive CRT to date have been somewhat inferior to those of surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [4]. However, the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) 0909 study recently reported that definitive CRT combined with salvage endoscopic resection or salvage surgery showed favorable overall survival and esophagectomy-free survival [5]. Thus, organ-preserving treatment will be a promising option for patients with resectable LA-ESCC in the future. However, the choice between surgery-based and organ-preserving definitive CRT-based treatment strategies is still difficult for patients. \n\nIn recent years, the introduction of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine has become a major topic of discussion. Radiomics is the study of systematically handling large amounts of imaging information in radiology [6]. The aim of radiomics is generally to extract quantitative, and ideally reproducible, information from diagnostic images, including complex patterns that are difficult to recognize or quantify by the human eye [7,8]. By combining radiomics and AI, attempts are being made to perform diagnostic imaging and to predict treatment outcomes [9][10][11][12][13].",

            "text": "Currently, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification is the most commonly used method to determine the clinical stage of cervical cancer. The FIGO staging guidelines were most recently updated in 2009 by the FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology [1]. Stage 0 is no longer included in the FIGO 2009 staging [1]. The clinical FIGO classification is exclusively used because cancer staging is a generally accepted universal stratification system for communication purposes among institutions. Despite continuous studies for the accurate staging of cervical cancer, the reality is that no entirely accurate method exists at present. Regarding the limitations of the clinical FIGO classification as the most commonly used method, the overall error rate of clinical staging for cervical cancer compared with surgical staging is between 20 and 66%. Clinical staging has revealed more inaccurate diagnoses, especially in advanced stages [2][3][4][5][6]. Furthermore, when distinguishing between stages IB and IIB, tumor invasion of the parametrium is one of the most important considerations. This determination completely depends on the attending gynecologist's findings via manual palpation, which is intrinsically subjective [7]. As complementary measures, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggests the use of imaging methods such as CT, MRI, and combined PET-CT in guiding treatment options and individual treatment design, but this practice guideline is not generally accepted for formal and 2 International Journal of Surgical Oncology official staging purposes. Accurate staging of cervical cancer is essential when making the therapeutic decision between radiation and surgery [8,9]. For early-stage disease, such as stage I and selected IIA, surgery or radiation therapy can be applied as treatment options [8,9]. There are various treatments for voluminous stage IB according to the location and size of the tumor. For advanced stages (stage IIB and greater), radiation therapy is typically chosen [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Thus, various methods for the accurate prognostic detection of parametrial invasion have been proposed [14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. However, more information is required to formulate accurate decisions regarding treatment for individual patients. With",

            "text": "O ver the last decades, imaging technologies have made significant developments, resulting in their current perpetual role in clinical oncology. The field has expanded greatly and now comprises various modalities, including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon-emission computed tomography. Because each modality has its specific advantages and disadvantages, the combination of different techniques has become standard practice for tumor detection, staging, and treatment evaluation [1]. \n\nHowever, when surgery is required, translation of these images to the operation field remains a major challenge for the surgeon. Visual appearance and palpation is the only way to discriminate between tumor and normal tissue and consequently determine an adequate tumor-free margin during surgery. This is a critical aspect of oncologic surgery because, apart from tumor characteristics (i.e., stage, differentiation grade), complete surgical removal is pivotal for the prognosis of the patient. \n\nReal-time imaging technologies could offer the possibility to put the images right under the hands of the surgeon, warranting intra-operative image-guided surgery. In order to detect malignant cells or tissues, the various hallmarks of cancer can be used as a target for imaging strategies: increased growth and growth factor signaling receptors, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and increased proteolytic activity resulting in tissue invasion and metastasis (Fig. 1) [2]. \n\nThe characteristic of increased metabolism is exploited in PET technology, using the glucose-mimetic 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F] fluoro-D-glucose. Tumor cells most frequently use glycol-ysis for energy generation, resulting in an increased glucose metabolism and the overexpression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) [3]. 2-Deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose is taken up by metabolically active cells, making it applicable in a wide range of tumors [4]. For intra-operative evaluation of tumor localization and margin status in breast cancer surgery, a hand-held PET probe to detect the high-energy gamma rays during surgery has been developed [5].",

            "text": "Surgical resection remains the most promising treatment strategy for many forms of cancer. Augmenting the efficacy of surgical intervention in cancer treatment through technologies aiming to improve contrast, such as image-guided surgery, can improve the prognosis and outcome of cancer treatment [1][2][3]. Residual cancerous tissue after surgery contributes to tumor recurrence and is a limitation of surgical efficacy, reducing the chances for long-term survival. Because surgeons are limited by what they can see and feel [4], tumor recurrence resulting from positive margins and metastases presents an opportunity to increase survival [2]. Thus, complete removal of cancerous tissue during the initial surgical intervention is critical to improved prognosis.\n\nGuidance during surgery for the detection of surgical margins and regional metastases is not easily accomplished using conventional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) due to the necessity of large or not easily modularized instrumentation [4]. Fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for intraoperative guidance. Contrast between malignant and healthy tissue requires higher signal in the tumor than the surrounding, healthy, or benign tissue. As reported by us [1,5,6] and others [3,7], the use of near infrared fluorescence contrast agents, both FDA-approved (i.e., indocyanine green (ICG)) and experimental, can guide surgeons in real-time, delineating tumor boundaries and improving outcome [2,3]. Integrating a preoperative imaging technique such as MRI or CT with FIGS could potentially improve surgical resection efficacy even more by defining margins for preoperative planning or further guiding surgeons to regional metastases [8]. Contrast agents must have suitable pharmacokinetic parameters, limited toxicity, and high sensitivity. To further improve the efficacy of FIGS, nanoparticle formulations are often used to specifically target or achieve higher uptake in cancerous tissue [9][10][11]. Nanoparticulate imaging agents have demonstrated superiority over combinations of small molecules [12] and are also more versatile, allowing for the incorporation of targeting moieties, drugs, and",

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic cancers [1]. More than 70% of patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage III or IV), and the 5-year survival rate is less than 30% [2]. To improve the survival of advanced ovarian cancer patients, optimal cytoreductive surgery (e.g., maximum diameter of 1 cm or less for the largest residual tumor mass) followed by postoperative platinum/taxane combination chemotherapy are the cornerstones of treatment [3,4]. The success rate for achievement of optimal cytoreduction varies widely, from 15 to 85%, in the literature [5]. However, if patients fail to achieve optimal cytoreduction, they may experience major morbidity without any survival benefit [6]. Therefore, a significant proportion of women with advanced ovarian cancer may undergo a debulking operation and experience the associated morbidity without any survival gains. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is an alternative treatment option to overcome situations in which it is difficult to achieve primary optimal cytoreduction [7]. Therefore, precise pretreatment discrimination of patients who are not amenable to optimal cytoreduction may be one of the principal determinants to reduce surgical morbidity. \n\nIn order to identify the patients who are less likely to benefit from primary cytoreductive surgery, several attempts have been made to determine specific predictors of cytoreductive outcome, including imaging modalities, tumor markers, and laparoscopic scores [8][9][10]. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) may be helpful in validating the selection and management of recurrent ovarian cancer patients by identification of extra-abdominal disease and may allow adequate planning of surgical debulking at retroperitoneal, hepatic, or splenic sites [11,12]. However, the role of FDG PET/CT in predicting the outcome of primary optimal cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer has not been reported.",

            "text": "Although it is usually possible to clinically estimate the size of a lesion in a patient with stage IIA disease, it may be cumbersome and possibly inaccurate and, therefore, many clinicians rely on imaging for accurate tumour size determination. It is especially the vertical tumour size that is frequently underestimated clinically. The reproducibility and comparability of imaging modalities for this purpose remains uncertain. FIGO has maintained that, since such modalities may not be available in lowresource settings, the staging is a clinical one. \n\nThe practicality of the new staging is partly determined by the usefulness of this division for treatment decisions. The separation of stage IIA could in uence primary treatment decisions, or could be used to determine the need for adjuvant therapy. As far as primary treatment is concerned, stage IIA1 has a good prognosis and may be treated with surgery or chemo-radiotherapy. Choices of treatment are often determined by available resources, but most Southern African centres will o er primary radical surgery with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection as an option to these patients. Larger tumours have a more guarded prognosis and are more di cult to remove radically with surgery. The choices for primary treatment of stage IIA2 cervical cancer include primary chemoradiation, primary radical hysterectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Since these tumours are bulky, adjuvant radiation is more likely to be necessary. Lymph node spread is also more common with bulky tumours and will necessitate referral for adjuvant chemoradiation. \n\nMost centres previously used tumour size and, thus, FIGO sub-stage to decide on modality of primary therapy in stage I. Similarly, tumour size was used intuitively in stage IIA before the changed staging. With the new formal division, it is hoped that even more patients will receive individualised therapy according to their unique tumour characteristics. It is anticipated that the new staging can also improve comparability of reported treatment outcomes, as strati cation is improved. \n\nChange is a fact of life.",

            "text": "Sigmoid colon cancer is routinely treated with upfront surgery, including colectomy with en bloc resection of lymph nodes. In comparison, rectal cancer is associated with a much higher risk of local recurrence than colon cancer. The extraperitoneal or non-peritonealized portion of the rectum largely accounts for this higher rate of local recurrence. With higher rates of recurrence, rectal cancer is treated with risk-adapted treatments. Depending upon whether the rectal cancer is staged as locally invasive, this frequently includes chemoradiation followed by post-treatment surgical evaluation for operative candidacy. New treatment regimens, such as TNT, deliver the neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in combination with either short or long course radiation therapy prior to surgical consideration. Some patients (15%-25%) will experience a successful response to preoperative treatment, and they may elect for nonoperative management such as \"Watch and Wait\" with continued endoscopic and imaging surveillance [ 2 ,5 ,6 ]. \n\nPreoperative imaging has assumed an important role in the management of rectal cancer [ 7 ]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the gold standard for preoperative evaluation of local disease site, including adjacent organ involvement and the nodal staging [ 8 ]. This imaging approach relies heavily on small field of view T2w imaging with high in-plane resolution coupled with functional imaging such as low and high b value diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with generated apparent diffusion (ADC) maps [ 9 ]. \n\nMRI can serve an important role in providing anatomic localization of colon cancer [ 10 ]. MRI is particularly useful when distinguishing sigmoid, rectosigmoid, and upper rectal tumors. This information provides critical direction regarding potential treatment options. As earlier described, the treatment for sigmoid colon cancer includes en bloc resection. For those patients with rectosigmoid tumors or high upper rectal tumors, the literature questions the benefits of chemoradiation. In 1998 Lopez-Kostner concluded that the surgical outcomes of upper rectal tumors mirrored those of sigmoid cancers with no statistically significant difference in local recurrence, distant recurrence, or death [ 11 ].",

Despite this, surgeons should also be aware of grasp the indications for NSCLC surgery as some patients fail to improve after surgery and other therapies should be considered.\n\nWith regard to non-surgical treatment, subgroup analysis indicated that surgery significantly decreased the cancer recurrence rate compared with radiotherapy and radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. However, compared with chemotherapy, the differences were insignificant. This might be because the sample size in the chemotherapy group was small compared with the surgical group.\n\nHowever, surgery was not significantly associated with a decreased regional recurrence rate and distant recurrence rate of NSCLC, when compared with non-surgical treatment. Distant metastasis after radical surgery is caused by tumor cells flowing into the pulmonary vein with blood flow (31). The presence of DTCs, CTCs or LDNs may increase the risk of distant NSCLC recurrence. This meta-analysis was a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the relationship between surgery and the risk of NSCLC recurrence had some advantages. Firstly, a large number of participants and cases ensured the reliability of the statistical data and conclusions. Secondly, this meta-analysis included case-control and cohort studies to determine the relationship between surgery and NSCLC recurrence. Thirdly, as our results showed that surgery decreased the risk of NSCLC recurrence in stage I-IV patients, surgery is a favorable treatment for curing NSCLC compared with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\nHowever, there are several limitations related to this article. Firstly, most of the included studies were from the USA and Europe. Therefore, our results might not be applicable to other groups of people. Secondly, the number of NSCLC patients with stage III\u2212IV disease included in the meta-analysis was small; thus, the data may not be sufficient to achieve reliable conclusions in stage III\u2212 IV NSCLC patients treated with surgery. Thirdly, our meta-analysis determined heterogeneity and observed that heterogeneity was partly caused by geographic area, statistical methods, NSCLC stage, sample size, etc. In order to determine the source of heterogeneity in this metaanalysis, subgroup analyses were conducted. The results of the subgroup analyses showed that surgery significantly decreased the risk of NS",

Therefore, there is a need to develop clinical prognostic models that can predict patient outcomes to potentially aid in developing comprehensive and patient-centered treatment regimens. \n\nAccording to the study, we performed a PSM analysis to minimize the effect of between-group differences. After PSM, patients who received therapy had better outcomes than those who did not. These data suggest that the survival benefit of RT can be complex, especially with modern techniques and doses. For pancreatic cancer patients who require surgery, individualized treatment plans and accurate assessment of patient survival and prognosis are particularly important. Therefore, we developed a reliable system to accurately predict patient survival time, taking into account multiple prognostic factors. \n\nWe identified and modeled independent prognostic factors associated with survival by COX analysis. Our study shows that T stage, N stage, grade, stage and histological type are important risk factors. Radiation and chemotherapy are vital protective factors. Previous studies have attempted to model the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients based on clinical features [26][27][28] . It has been evidenced that higher T and N stage, poor differentiation, stage and ductal adenocarcinoma are related to the worse prognosis. TNM staging evaluates patient prognosis by tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis 29 . However, disease progression is much more complex than the classical form. It is worth noting that, overall, the contribution of T or N staging to the survival of surgical patients mainly was no more significant than that of differentiation 30 .Our study also produced the same result. This means survival varies widely among pancreatic cancer surgery patients, even for the same TNM stage. Among other factors, the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer may be related to histological subtypes, particularly differences in survival rates for different histological types 31 . Ductal adenocarcinoma is a factor in poor survival in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer compared to other histological types 32 . The response of different histological exocrine pancreatic subtypes to tumor chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains unclear.",

            "text": "Although limited in size, this subset was chosen to be representative in terms of the number of identified lesions for patients with low, medium,  and high tumor burden, respectively. Moreover, the fact that the proposed data preparation strategy successfully reproduced clinical progression events in assessment (3) gives us strong confidence in the generalizability of our findings. Nonetheless, our pipeline should be validated in large-scale future studies including a larger number of expert-reviewed examinations of multiple cancer types, originating from multiple centers and acquired on multiple imaging platforms. \n\nWe expect the combination of longitudinal lesion tracking and consistency voting to have high potential for automated RWD curation for population-based analyses of cancer treatment outcomes, but the accuracy achievable with current automatic segmentation tools may not suffice for usage in clinical applications. Nevertheless, we believe that automatic longitudinal tracking, in conjunction with improved segmentation tools, will also have applications beyond the population research context, for example, to assist radiologists in follow-up examination assessments or as a monitoring tool that helps oncologists review patient cases on the basis of trends in disease evolution. \n\nAlthough further development is needed, we believe that semi-or fully automated approaches such as the ones presented will ultimately help make RWD more accessible. \n\nBy combining clinical and imaging data, these approaches pave the way for improved patient selection and treatment recommendations in the era of personalized medicine. A recent paper highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence techniques combined with pharmacometrics to guide treatment individualization in the specific context of ICIs. 32 Indeed, our curated tumor evolution data can be analyzed using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation approaches to capture patterns of tumor responses to treatment. 33,34 Furthermore, there is growing interest in medical imaging data to guide therapies via noninvasive image-based biomarkers. Following the segmentation and longitudinal mapping steps, quantitative image descriptors, so-called radiomics features, can be computed straightforwardly for all identified tumors. Such features were shown to be predictive markers of overall survival in several cancer types 35,36 and have the potential to predict early response to ICIs in patients with melanoma. 37",

            "text": "Yuen et al. [21] found that, in patients with tongue carcinoma, increased tumor thickness reduced 5-year disease-free survival and increased the risk of cervical metastasis and local recurrence. \n\nMany recent studies have calculated pretreatment gross tumor volumes (GTVs) from CT scans; GTVs predict the prognoses of patients with nonsurgically treated carcinoma in different cervical subsites. [23] [25] Increases in the GTVs of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and supraglottic carcinomas are associated with progressively reduced probabilities of local control. [23] 5][26] GTV measurements also identify patients who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. In patients at moderate risk of local recurrence after RT alone, the additional morbidity and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy may be objectively justified; the local control rate may be better when an RT/chemotherapy combination is prescribed. [24,25] Advanced-stage large-volume tumors are unlikely to respond to any form of combined nonsurgical therapy. Thus, volumetric data can be used for early identification of patients at high failure risk, triggering surgical intervention. This would limit the morbidity associated with delayed, unsuccessful combined therapy. \n\nYilmaz et al. [22] evaluated the significance of invasion depth in laryngeal cancer. And they found that invasion depth is related to metastasis free disease and long survival rate. In another study, depth of tumor invasion is highly associated with tumor location and diameter in laryngeal cancers. [26] on et al. [27] assessed the success of tumor thickness as a predictive factor in showing recurrence of early glottic cancer in a study. They reported that the consideration of tumoral thickness, which is an important prognostic factor, before surgery is a guide for the extension of the tumor. In our study, however, no significant relationship was found between the depth of invasion and lymph node involvement. We think that the reason that we found such different results from the literature may be due to the presence of interobserver variability among pathologists.",

            "text": "Stage 1 cervical cancer is primarily treated with hysterectomy, although less radical surgical options (cone biopsy, trachelectomy) are considered where fertility preservation is desirable [1e4]. Decisions regarding the type and extent of surgery and the subsequent need for adjuvant therapy depend on tumor resectability and the risk of recurrence. Biomarkers that predict recurrence, therefore, are of paramount importance for selecting the most appropriate treatment options. In tumors >2 cm in longest dimension, preoperative tumor volume is a powerful adverse prognostic factor associated with reduced overall survival [5,6]. Other prognostic factors, such as tumor type, grade, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and depth of stromal invasion are derived from a biopsy [7e10], and therefore may not represent the tumor in its entirety. Prognostic biomarkers derived from imaging would be more representative of the whole tumor and would enable selection of the optimal surgical management at the outset in Stage 1 disease. \n\nMagnetic Resonance imaging is routinely used to detect and stage cervical cancer, where T2-W and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging form the mainstay of diagnostic sequences [11,12]. Derivation of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from the DW images [13] and analysis of first order histogram distribution of ADC values has been shown to predict histological subtype [14,15], staging [16], parametrial invasion [17], LVSI [18] the response to chemo-radiotherapy [19] and to aid surgical decision-making [20]. However, these first-order statistical quantitative imaging data remain limited in their prediction of likely recurrence [21]. It is possible to refine image analysis and convert the T2-W [22] and DW [23] imaging data into a high-dimensional feature space using algorithms to extract a more extensive set of statistical features within the data. This type of analysis, referred to as \"radiomics\", requires that the data have a high signal-to-noise ratio to reduce error in the analysis from image noise; this is achievable in cervical cancer using an endovaginal MRI technique [24].",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among females in the world, with over 1 million new cases every year. [1,2] Effective treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, local radiation, and systemic chemotherapy. Due to its radical nature, surgery has now been reduced to a minimum by the use of breastconserving procedures [3,4] and axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection. [5] Lymph node status is an important prognostic factor for breast cancer. [6] Nodal stage also affects the selection of adjuvant therapeutic modalites. [7] Patients with N2 or greater disease have an increased risk of locoregional recurrence and postmastectomy radiotherapy should be considered for those patients. [8] By contrast, N1 patients have been found to receive few benefits from adjuvant radiotherapy. [9] Therefore, preoperative characterization of nodal stage is of clinical significance in breast cancer treatment decision-making. \n\nSeveral imaging techniques are currently available for preoperative assessment of lymph node status, including mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). [10,11] Axillary ultrasonography is useful in excluding N2 and N3 invasive ductal metastases. [12] However, an axillary ultrasound fails to accurately differentiate between pN1 and pN2-pN3 breast cancer. [13] he aim of this study is to determine the power of combined mammography and ultrasonography in differentiating N0 (negative axillary nodes) and N1 disease from N2 and N3 disease.",

Univariate analysis using Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests was performed to explore associations between type of surgery and patient, surgical, and tumor characteristics. The proportion of patients undergoing PN versus RN was determined for every clinical T stage, and statistical significance of trend over stage was determined using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. We calculated estimates of the probability of RFS and mortality using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. The logrank test was used to compare the oncological outcomes of patients according to surgery type (PN vs. RN). We also used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association of surgery type on RFS and mortality while controlling for pathologic T stage, tumor size, grade, and histology. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated using the Schoenfeld test. Due to imbalances in clinical T stage distribution among the PN versus RN groups, we conducted a subgroup analysis of patients with cT1b specifically, which had an almost equal number of patients who underwent PN or RN. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata (College Station, Texas, USA) version 16.1, and all P values were two-sided with statistical significance set at <0.05.

            "text": "). This finding is worthy of further discussion regarding the oncological outcomes of laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgery in patients with stage IB3 cervical cancer in the NACT group. The considerations described above may account for the differences in the conclusions between previous studies and the present study.\n\nThe present study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, it does not provide the highest level of evidence. Second, the NACT treatment plan may have had an impact on prognosis. The present study did not detail the impact of different plans and different treatment courses on patient prognosis. The present study analyzed only the proportion of patients who received postoperative radiotherapy and did not analyze postoperative complications. Third, all patients with stage IB3 cervical cancer in this study received surgical treatment, although in other countries most of these patients are treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy; this difference may make the conclusions not broadly applicable. However, the latest randomized controlled study (EORTC 55994) confirmed that the efficacy of NACT followed by surgery is similar to that of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage IB2-IIB cervical cancer (FIGO 2009) with no difference in 5-year OS (72% and 76%, respectively, p=0.332) (31). Nama et al. (32) also reported that there is no single randomized controlled trial in which direct surgery for stage IB2 (FIGO 2009) is compared with chemoradiotherapy; thus, this area requires further research. The current results suggest that surgical treatment is an option for stage IB3 cervical cancer. In addition, our analysis of NACT sensitivity excluded patients whose tumor diameters before or after NACT were unknown. The clinical records were not standardized, which may have caused selection bias. Finally, the identification of NACT-sensitive patients before the administration of NACT was also an important prognostic factor.",

In the first domain, we compared the clinical characteristics of the entire cohort of patients between the three age groups. The distribution of symptomology, body mass index (BMI) and pre-treatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were compared. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was determined at the time of initial medical or radiation oncology consultation. Patients cancer stage was established using the framework in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual. Tumour distance from the anal verge (FAV) was measured from the caudal extremity of the rectal mass to the anal opening established through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis pre-treatment.\n\nThe second domain explored treatment approaches looking first and foremost at the proportion of patients who underwent surgery and the type of surgery undertaken. For those that did not undergo surgery, the treatment modality consisting of palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy or no treatment was specified. Patients that underwent curative surgical resections were then analysed for any pathological differences between tumours in each age group. The amount of regional lymph nodes retrieved intraoperatively and involvement of the margin of the resected specimen were used as surrogates for the robustness of surgery. Histological grade, the presence of lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion and tumour size were determined upon evaluation by the treating pathologist. Receipt of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemo-or radiotherapy was then compared. The specific chemoradiotherapy regimens were guided by local protocols and agreed upon by members of the MDT.\n\nFinally, the primary outcomes were examined and included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) measured throughout the follow up period. Analyses of the former two survival measures included the entire cohort of patients, whereas DFS only included patients who underwent curative treatment. OS was defined as the interval from the time of diagnosis to the time of death or censored at the last follow up if the patient was alive. CSS was defined as the interval from the time of diagnosis to the time of cancer-related",

            "text": "Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide [1], showing particularly high incidence in countries with low socioeconomic status. There is wide regional variation in the use of imaging modalities, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in particular, in the work-up of cervical cancer. Accordingly, the FIGO classification [2], which is the internationally recognised staging system for cervical cancer, relies solely on clinical examination in assessing tumour stage. However, the current FIGO classification acknowledges the use of imaging methods as an adjunct for cervical cancer staging, and a number of studies have shown that imaging, especially MRI, is superior to clinical examination alone for correctly evaluating cervical carcinoma stage [3][4][5][6][7]. This is of particular importance in regard to the identification of parametrial invasion and the correct assessment of tumour size, given their important implications for the choice of treatment, i.e. fertility-sparing surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy [8,9].\n\nLymph node status is not part of the FIGO classification system; however, lymph node metastases are an important independent adverse prognostic factor [10]. The depth of stromal tumour invasion is associated with an increased risk for lymph node metastases [11]. Surgical lymph node dissection remains the Bgold standard^for the diagnosis of lymph node metastases, but it may be associated with postoperative complication rates of up to 17% [12] and with unwanted side effects such as lymphoceles and wound infections. Therefore, preoperative assessment of lymph node stage using imaging may have great clinical importance.\n\nHistological subtype and grade of differentiation may also determine the course of the disease, the therapeutic outcome and patient survival [10,13]. Squamous cell carcinomas represent the majority of cervical cancer cases (ca. 69%) compared to adenocarcinomas (ca. 25%) [14,15]. Whether clinical outcome differs between squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas still remains controversial. However, rare tumour subtypes like neuroendocrine tumours have an unfavourable prognosis [16].",

            "text": "Ovarian cancer (OC) a disease that affects women's ovaries, is difficult to diagnose early, and has a high fatality rate [1]. OC has the highest mortality rate and is the leading cause of gynaecological deaths. There are two primary forms of invasive ovarian cancer, often referred to as Type-I and Type-II tumours [2]. Low-grade endometrial carcinomas, Low-grade serous carcinomas, clear-cell carcinomas, mucinous carcinomas, and malignant Brenner (transitional) tumours are examples of early-stage, nonaggressive type-I malignancies [3] [4]. Seventy-five percent of epithelial ovarian malignancies are type II tumours, which include highgrade serous carcinomas, high-grade endometriosis carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and malignant mixed mesodermal tumours. CT scans are routinely used to diagnose ovarian tumours, detect metastases, determine the stage of ovarian cancer, monitor patients following surgery, and evaluate the success of treatment [5]. Some ovarian epithelial tumours do not seem to be malignant when examined in the lab, and they are referred to as borderline epithelial ovarian cancer. Screening tests and exams identify diseases in people with no symptoms, such as cancer [6]. The abdomen and pelvis CT scan is the first-line imaging modality for ovarian cancer staging, therapy options selection and disease response assessment. The imaging surrogate for surgical-pathological FIGO staging is the staging CT, which gives disease distribution and load. This is mostly due to late detection, although OC often recurs after treatment. The remarkable difference in cure between patients with close illness and those with distant disease (15% vs. 25%) eloquently illustrates the need for a non-invasive but feasible diagnostic applicable to a large population expected to be afflicted by OC in its early stages [7].",

            "text": "[3] Adenocarcinoma is currently the most common pathologic type of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). [4] In general, pulmonary lobectomy is regarded as the gold standard therapy for lung cancer. However, in recent years, studies have found that early sublobectomy can be equally as effective as lobectomy and is associated with superior retention of lung function, which is important for patient quality of life. Sublobectomy is performed in patients who do not have lymph node metastasis and in tumors containing \"ground-glass nodules\" in particular. The identification of such patients, who will avoid excessive treatment, is an important component of individualized treatment. Because early lung cancer lesions are small, and preoperative biopsy can cause the dissemination of tumor cells, it is crucial to identify the presence of lymph node metastasis to determine the most appropriate surgical approach. \n\nTNM stage is the most important prognostic indicator for lung cancer, whereas traditional pathologic classification is not related to the treatment or prognosis. [7][8] With the development and popularization of imaging technologies, such as the wide application of low-dose spiral computed tomography, highresolution computed tomography (CT), thin-layer scanning, and 3-dimensional reconstruction technologies, increasing numbers of small lung cancers with tumor diameter 3 cm are being detected in the clinic. However, lymph node metastasis is not easily identified prior to surgery if the primary tumor has a diameter 3 cm, even using thin-layer CT, PET-CT, or other modalities. In addition, it is unclear whether the pathologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma, especially of those tumors with a diameter 3 cm, affects the likelihood of lymph node metastasis. \n\nWe aimed to determine the relationship between pathologic subtype and lymph node metastasis in patients undergoing radical resection of lung adenocarcinomas of 3 cm diameter by retrospective analysis of the cases enrolled at our center and to identify the risk factors affecting the likelihood of metastasis. The findings provide a basis for the likelihood of lymph node metastasis to guide lung cancer surgery.",

            "text": "In an earlier study on the prognosis and clinicopathological features of SDPGCC and MDPGCC, we found that MDPGCC had a better prognosis than SDPGCC, and the proportion of non-advanced gastric and colorectal cancers was significantly higher in patients with MDPGCC [7]. The results of these earlier studies have raised the question as to which offers the best prognosis in MDPGCC, that with GP or CP. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features of GP-and CP-MDPGCC and determine the biological significance of these two types of malignancy in making a prognosis. In this study, the 5-year survival rate in the GP-and CP-MDPGCC groups was 84.7% and 83.3%, respectively. In our earlier study, it was suggested that the better prognosis observed with MDPGCC was due to more frequent detection in patients with early-stage cancer during routine follow-up after surgery for the first primary cancer. In fact, 54.5% of patients with GP-and 50.0% of patients with CP-DPGCC in the current analysis had received gastrointestinal examination before diagnosis of second primary cancer. In this study, death occurred from colorectal cancer as the second primary cancer in 3 cases (75.0%) in the GP-, and from gastric cancer as the second primary cancer in 2 cases (66.6%) in the CP-MDPGCC groups. These data appear to indicate a genetic and environmental relationship between gastric and colorectal cancer. Previous studies of patients receiving surgical treatment at all stages of gastric and colorectal cancer reported the 5-year survival rate to be 73.7% (11) and 69.9% [16]. On the other hand, phase III clinical trials of S-1 plus cisplatin for advanced gastric cancer have yielded good responses and a median overall survival rate of 13.0 months [17]. Phase III clinical trials of FOLFOX4 for advanced colorectal cancer have yielded good responses and a median overall survival rate of 15.0 months [18]. Sensitivity of chemotherapy seems to be relationship between gastric and colorectal cancer.",

The D'Amico classification system continues to stratify men into risk groups with statistically significant differences in Biochemical riskfree survival. However, the major shift in the distribution of patients among the three risk groups over time suggests that the clinical relevance of this classification scheme may be limited and diminishing in the contemporary era. \n\nThe strategies for definitive, adjuvant, and salvage local treatment, including radical prostatectomy or Key words: Prostate cancer Surgery, Radiation therapy, Hormone therapy Chemotherapy, Genetic testing radiation therapy, serve as the backbone of therapy for patients with localized disease. Systemic therapy decisions regarding use in combination with Surgery, choice of therapy (hormone therapy, chemotherapy), and treatment duration continue to be refined. Integrating innovative blood and tissue-based biomarkers to guide therapy selection for patients with high-risk diseases is an active research area. Contemporary studies are using such biomarkers to stratify patients and select therapies. In this review, the current evidence for local treatment strategies, systemic therapy options, and biomarkers in development for managing high-risk prostate cancer in patients will be discussed for patients with highrisk prostate cancer who have an increased risk of disease recurrence and death from prostate cancer. \n\nIn addition to PSA level and MRI results, the decision to biopsy or not should be made in light of DRE findings, ethnicity, age, comorbidities, free/total PSA, history of previous biopsy, and patient values. Local treatment strategies include definitive radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy with or without adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy. Systemic therapy for patients with high-risk diseases includes androgen deprivation therapy, although many questions remain regarding the use with Surgery, intensity, and duration of androgen deprivation therapy. Blood and tissuebased biomarkers to guide therapy selection remain an area of active research, and contemporary clinical trials are integrating such predictive biomarkers to better guide therapy selection for patients at high risk.",

            "text": "Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; their incidence is increasing most in older patients. NMSCs have traditionally been treated with surgical excision, curettage, Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), and superficial radiotherapy (SRT). Image-guided SRT (IGSRT) is a treatment option for poor surgical candidates or patients with low- or high-risk, early-stage NMSC who prefer to avoid surgery. This large retrospective cohort study compared 2-, 4-, and 6-year freedom from recurrence in biopsy-proven NMSC lesions treated with IGSRT (n = 20,069 lesions) between patients aged < 65 years (n = 3158 lesions) and \u226565 years (n = 16,911 lesions). Overall freedom from recurrence rates were 99.68% at 2 years, 99.57% at 4 years, and 99.57% at 6 years. Rates did not differ significantly by age (p = 0.8) nor by sex among the two age groups (p > 0.9). There was a significant difference in recurrence among older patients when analyzed by stage (p = 0.032), but no difference by stage in younger patients (p = 0.7). For early-stage NMSCs, IGSRT is a clinically equivalent alternative to MMS and statistically significant in superiority to non-image-guided SRT. This study demonstrates that there is no significant effect of age on 2-, 4-, or 6-year freedom from recurrence in patients with IGSRT-treated NMSC.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is primarily treated via surgical excision of the tumour with the surrounding normal breast tissue margin. In the early stage, these treatments take the form of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or lumpectomy. 1 Although BCS provides satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, the re-resection rate is \u00bb20%, and of these surgeries, \u00bb85% are performed due to the presence of initial positive margins. 2 Although there is often a need for further surgery and additional tissue removal owing to the inherent challenges in achieving negative margins, existing guidelines recommend against excising a wider negative margin in routine practice. 3 Currently, surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile cues to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissues and thus may leave residual lesions in the tumour bed. 4 MRI, mammography, ultrasound, and CT etc. are readily available imaging modalities typically used to assess the tumour lesion prior to the surgical procedure. Although these traditional imaging modalities have been of immense help in advancing tumour detection and determining the extent of resection(s), 5 the need for accurate intraoperative imaging remains one of the most important unmet needs in the management of breast cancer at the time of the initial BCS. \n\nExtensive research is ongoing to identify new, rapid, and accurate intraoperative margin assessment tools, some of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. 6 For example, among biophotonic-based techniques, image-guided surgery using fluorescence imaging offers many advantages for surgeons. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is an emerging biomedical imaging modality for fluorescence-guided surgery because of its significant light absorption, ability to assist in real-time visualization, and lack of ionizing radiation. In vivo imaging in the NIR range (700\u00c0900 nm) is superior to that in the visible spectrum owing to its low scattering, negligible tissue autofluorescence, and relatively high tissue penetration. 7 The first FDA-approved NIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG), has been used in clinical practice to determine the liver function, cardiac output, and blood flow etc) for over fifty years due to its proven safety and the feasibility of its use. Also, ICG has been tested for tumour margin identification.",

            "text": "Determining an optimal treatment plan for an individual patient with rectal cancer is a complex process. In addition to facing decisions regarding the intent of rectal cancer surgery, consideration must also be given to the validity of the treatment results, including the probability of maintaining or restoring normal bowel function/anal continence and preserving genitourinary functions. Careful patient selection with respect to particular treatment options and the use of sequenced multimodality therapy for selected patients, which combines chemo -radiation with operative treatment as part of the treatment regimen, is recommended. The main objective in diagnostically imaging patients with rectal cancer is to detect lesions and assess the extent of those lesions, in order to better assist the selection of appropriate therapy. Patients with rectal cancer appropriate for resection require complete staging evaluation, including full colonoscopy to evaluate the synchronous lesions, rigid proctoscopy to determine the location of the cancer, baseline computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a complete physical examination. \n\nThe accessibility of evaluating rectal cancer by certain imaging modalities, such as endoanal US (EAUS) and MRI scan, makes preoperative assessments of the depth of tumor penetration and the presence of local lymph nodal metastases possible. Additional information regarding the extent of the disease and the occurrence of distant metastases can be determined preoperatively through CT scans. Thus, endorectal ultrasound, or endorectal or pelvic MRI, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, are recommended for the preoperative staging of rectal cancer. A positron emission tomography scan is not routinely indicated at baseline in the absence of evidence of synchronous metastasis disease. \n\nThe most common method for determining the stage of colorectal cancer is the AJCC/TNM system CC VII (15). General CT and MSCT are now the most widely used methods in determining the stage of colorectal cancer (Figure 1 and Figure 2) (9,10).",

            "text": "In 2015, approximately 80% of new cancer cases required surgery [40]. Worldwide, about 45 mil surgical procedures will be required by 2030; however, a small percentage of cancer patients are able to receive safe, inexpensive and well-timed surgery [40]. Surgery is a fundamental treatment option used to prevent, diagnose and cure cancer [40]. Additionally, surgery is used for palliative care and cosmesis [40]. Preventive surgery aims to remove tissue that is susceptible to carcinogenesis, while diagnostic techniques are important in determining the appropriate treatment and management of cancer [40]. In the attempt to cure cancer patients, surgery (minor or major) is vital, always needed and greatly effects patient outcomes [40]. Resection and reconstructive surgery is important for palliative care and improving cosmesis, respectively [40]. In 2030, surgery will be required by approximately 80% of the estimated 21.6 mil new cancer cases [40]. A promising use of Nbs in surgery is imaging-guided surgery [11]. Previously, the anti-HER-2 Ab trastuzumab was dual labeled with 111 In and IRDye800CW [41]. Deken et al. (2019) demonstrated that in orthotopic HER-2+ BT474 tumors, 111 In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated as well as allowed the visualization of tumors by micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging [41]. Additionally, the dual-labeled trastuzumab enabled the image-guided resection of tumors [41]. Kijanka et al. (2013) conjugated an anti-HER-2 Nb (11A4) to IRDye800CW and demonstrated that 11A4-IRDye800CW increased tumor accumulation and tumor-to-background ratios as compared to trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in human xenograft breast cancer models (Table 2) [42]. Additionally, 11A4-IRDye800CW was used in image-guided surgery for the removal of SKBR3 tumors in mice (Table 3) [42].",

            "text": "In this study we investigated the potential of using radiomics features to predict the optimal number of fields for postoperative adjuvant breast cancer radiotherapy. Besides, we also explored clinical factors that were related to the number of fields. The results showed that the model based on clinical features and rad-score could offer a reliable reference for determining the adequate number of fields. \n\nFor clinical model, it was shown that N stage plays a key role in distinguishing 4-fields, 5-fields, and 7-fields plans. Patients with N0 stage are likely to be given 4-fields plans. However, patients with lymph node metastasis are inclined to be treated with 5-fields or 7-fields plans. The possible reason is that, due to the lymph node area included in the GTV, it is not enough for 4fields plans yield the same dose homogeneity as that of 5-fields or 7-fields plans. In brief, N stage determines whether the lymph node should be included in the GTV or not, and large or small GTV eventually gives rise to how many fields should be used in the radiotherapy plans. \n\nT stage and surgery type are also related to the optimal number of fields. Specifically, patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery are more likely to be given 4-fields plans, while those who underwent radical mastectomy are more suitable for 6-fields and 7-fields plans. This may be due to the target area after radical surgery is more irregular than breast-conversing surgery. Furthermore, the dose conformality within the target area is a challenge with a 4-fields plan. Previous reports also showed that the conformality within the target area can be improved by adding more fields. 25 ll these clinical factors, which may be related to number of fields, still need further exploration to reveal the interrelationship. \n\nIn recent years, radiomics has been widely used in diagnosis, staging, and prognosis prediction of breast cancer. 18,26 In addition, radiomics models can predict the risk of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, thereby guiding the segmentation of radiotherapy target volumes. 27 By contrast, it is still unclear whether radiomics is helpful or not in radiotherapy treatment planning.",

These elements include the tumor size, location within the pancreas, extension beyond the pancreas with or without contact with the adjacent vessels, and the presence or absence of metastatic lesions. A complete and comprehensive imaging report should therefore be inclusive of at least all the above elements with the option of adding details that may affect surgical planning as per institutional protocol or preference.

            "text": "This determination was important for ensuring the patients we selected most likely had SPLC, as SPLC can often be difficult to distinguish from IPLC recurrences. Patient characteristics were collected including age at first diagnosis, sex, histology, family history, race, smoking history, stage of first diagnosis, treatment modality, whether a patient had surgery after IPLC diagnosis, and patient living status. Patient histological classifications were categorized as small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and other non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Family history was classified as to whether patients had a first-degree relative with a diagnosis of lung cancer. Smoking behaviors were examined in several ways. Patient smoking history at first diagnosis, as well as smoking status following IPLC treatment, were recorded. Patients were also divided into nonsmokers, light smokers, and heavy smokers based on their number of pack years at first diagnosis. Heavy smokers were defined as having a 30 or more pack year smoking history. Patients were assigned as light smokers if they had a history of smoking less than 30 pack years. Nonsmokers were denoted to patients with no history of smoking. \n\nStage at first diagnosis was categorized as localized, regional, or distant. Localized classification was given if the cancer was found limited to an individual lung on diagnosis. Regional stage of diagnosis was denoted if the cancer had metastasized to mediastinal lymph nodes. Distant stage of diagnosis was determined if metastasis had advanced to the contralateral lung or other organs. IPLC treatment modality was classified as surgery, chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or radiation. If a patient received multiple treatment options, modality was segregated by most definitive and prominent treatment. For example, if a patient had surgery and chemotherapy, their treatment modality was classified as surgery because of the more definitive nature of surgical resection. Whether a patient had surgery after their IPLC was individually isolated and compared with patients who did not receive resection following their first diagnosis.",

            "text": "3][4] Allal et al demonstrated the prognostic value of standardized uptake value (SUV) from pretreatment PET in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation with or without chemotherapy. 5 Patients with tumors with high tumor SUV max had a significantly lower 3-year local control (55% vs. 86%, p \u00bc 0.01) and disease-free survival (42% vs. 79%, p \u00bc 0.005) compared to patients with tumors with low FDG uptake. In the setting of cervical cancer, 287 patients with Stage IA2-IVB disease who underwent pre-treatment PET followed by surgery, chemoradiation, or palliation were assessed for SUVmax, tumor volume, sites of lymph node metastases, and histology, and only SUVmax was identified as an independent predictor of death from cervical cancer. 6 evelopment of a range of complex image analytics has led to the expansion of the field of \"radiomics,\" which utilizes data beyond the single value represented by SUVmax, a value limited by patient-specific and image-acquisition-specific factors. 7,8 Radiomics is a method of quantitative data extraction from radiographic imaging to find image correlates to tumor characteristics. 9,10 A potential application is to identify complex image intensity, shape, and textural features that predict a tumor's behavior, response to treatment, and oncologic outcomes, but very few multi-parametric studies have looked at these relationships. 11 n cervical carcinoma, even with optimal therapy, at least 20% of patients with locally advanced disease confined to the pelvis will fail distantly. 12,13 Identifying these patients early may allow physicians to tailor their treatment to achieve a more durable treatment response and prevent distant failure with additional systemic treatment. The goal of this study is to build a predictive model, using pre-treatment clinical and imaging characteristics, that determines likelihood of locoregional and distant failure for cervical carcinoma patients, enabling the selection of patients who should be considered for further systemic therapy.",

VATS procedure is done by a thoracoscope which has a light and a tiny camera connected to monitor which helps in identifying the extraction of cancer tissue with minimal invasion and fewer complications [48]. Although surgery is ideal in NSCLC treatment, but it is still a major operation bearing serious side effects. Thus, it isn't preferred always. Side effects of surgery rely on the extent of surgery and patient's overall health. Effects may include reactions to anesthesia, excess bleeding, blood clots, pneumonia, wound infections and in rare cases, death may be seen. \uf0b7 Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) -Radio-frequency ablation is technique using radio waves to treat cancer by creating heat. RFA is done by a probe (a needle) kept into the tumor through skin of chest with the help of CT scanner for the accurate positioning. An electrode present in the probe creates radio-frequency energy to produce heat and destroy the cancer tissue. Adverse effects of RFA are pain, fatigue and possible risk of pneumothorax [49]. \uf0b7 Radiation Therapy (RT) -RT uses beams of extreme energy to kill cancer cells. In RT X-rays are most often used but sometimes protons or other types of energy beams are also used. The term RT refers external beam radiation. During the treatment, high-energy beams are send from an external machine that aims at precisely marked point on body. RT acts by destroying the genetic material of cell that commands the growth and division [50].",

            "text": "Esophageal and gastroesophageal junction malignancies are among the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide and responsible for a significant disease burden globally [1].At initial presentation, a significant proportion of the patients are found to have advanced metastatic disease [2].Thus, a significant proportion of patients are excluded from curative surgical treatment and will be delivered palliative therapy instead, while for patients with early-stage disease, surgery (commonly along with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) may be a curative option [1,3].\n\nPositron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) is a cornerstone in patient staging and a complementary technique to endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), especially to determine advanced metastatic disease [1,4]. 18F-FDG-PET/CT semi-quantitative metabolic parameters have been shown to have both diagnostic and prognostic value [5,6].In addition, it has been reported that the value of 18 F-FDG-PET/CT can be potentially enhanced even further using a quantitative image evaluation approach such as radiomics [7][8][9].Radiomics refers to extracting and analyzing large amounts of quantitative features on medical images, which can be utilized to feed artificial intelligence methods, such as machine learning algorithms [10].Its general workflow includes image reconstruction, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and data analysis.\n\nSeveral clinical parameters were reported to be of value in gastroesophageal cancer prognostication, such as disease stage, histopathology grade, sex, age (particularly \u226570 years), body mass index (BMI), and functional impairment [3,[11][12][13].Also, it has been found that patients with more aggressive gastroesophageal malignancies are often malnourished and cachectic due to cancer-related symptoms.To assess this, sarcopenia, a severe depletion of skeletal muscle mass, has been introduced as a marker [14,15].",

            "text": "Background Our study analyzed disparities in utilization and phase-specific costs of care among older colorectal cancer patients in the United States. We also estimated the phase-specific costs by cancer type, stage at diagnosis, and treatment modality. Methods We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to identify patients aged 66 or older diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer between 2000\u20132013, with follow-up to death or December 31, 2014. We divided the patient\u2019s experience into separate phases of care: staging or surgery, initial, continuing, and terminal. We calculated total, cancer-attributable, and patient-liability costs. We fit logistic regression models to determine predictors of treatment receipt and fit linear regression models to determine relative costs. All costs are reported in 2019 US dollars. Results Our cohort included 90,023 colon cancer patients and 25,581 rectal cancer patients. After controlling for patient and clinical characteristics, Non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely to receive treatment but were more likely to have higher cancer-attributable costs within different phases of care. Overall, in both the colon and rectal cancer cohorts, mean monthly cost estimates were highest in the terminal phase, next highest in the staging phase, decreased in the initial phase, and were lowest in the continuing phase. Conclusions Racial/ethnic disparities in treatment utilization and costs persist among colorectal cancer patients. Additionally, colorectal cancer costs are substantial and vary widely among stages and treatment modalities. This study provides information regarding cost and treatment disparities that can be used to guide clinical interventions and future resource allocation to reduce colorectal cancer burden.",

            "text": "Although the occurrence of gastric cancer has declined recently, it remains the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. While surgery remains the only curative treatment option, preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has demonstrated favorable results with increased therapeutic resection rates and improved survival [2]. Preventing the adverse effect of NAC, patients with different disease stages must be distinguished from each other [3] because, for each step of the disease, the treatment would be different [4]. Recent studies demonstrated that applying preoperative NAC for advanced gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis (PM) yielded a much better clinical outcome and enhanced the overall survival rate [5][6][7][8]. Thus, accurate assessment of the presence of the PM is essential for the selection of appropriate patients for NAC. \n\nSince the overall accuracies of subjectively reading endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) images are not completely reliable [3,4], an alternative technique is needed to facilitate the assessment of tumor stages and the risk of PM. \n\nRecently, many previous studies have revealed that novel radiomics technique could extract quantitative information from medical images with a large pool of image features, and the data mining of image feature pool offers an exciting approach to build machine learning (ML) models and predict clinical outcomes [9,10]. Although several radiomics based ML models have been reported to differentiate and stage gastric cancer patients [11,12], these studies computed radiomics features from the tumor region manually segmented from one CT slice selected by the radiologists. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis based method was used to select a small set of image features, which cannot eliminate the redundancy of the selected features. Thus, discriminatory power and prediction accuracy of these ML models were limited. To overcome such limitations, we in this study propose to develop and evaluate a new computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme aiming to predict the risk of PM among gastric cancer patients. First, our scheme segments primary gastric tumor volume in 3D CT image data, which can better compute image features related to the heterogeneity of the tumors.",

            "text": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of death among women worldwide. In 2020, there were an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide [1]. Although early-stage cervical cancer portends a favorable prognosis, a large tumor size (>4 cm) is associated with worse survival and more local pelvic recurrence than a smaller tumor, regardless of treatment modality [2][3][4]. For early bulky tumors, treatment options include radical surgery (radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy) with or without adjuvant therapy, primary radiation, or concurrent chemoradiation. However, the optimal treatment is still under debate. \n\nA previous randomized study [3] showed equivalent effectiveness by either primary surgery or radiotherapy, whereas two Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) [5,6] studies revealed that surgery improved survival. Bansal et al. [5] reported that radical hysterectomy was associated with a 49% reduction in the mortality rate for 4-6 cm tumors but equivalent survival for >6 cm tumors compared with primary radiation. Moreover, radical hysterectomy with tailored adjuvant therapy has been suggested because it is the most cost-effective strategy in early bulky cervical tumors compared with primary chemoradiation [7,8]. Concerning the inconsistent conclusion from the above studies [3,5,6], there is a need to clarify suitable treatment modalities in this patient population. \n\nIn addition to tumor size, clinical prognostic factors, including tumor markers (SCC and CEA levels) and tumor histology (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma), also have an impact on treatment response and survival [9][10][11]. The prognostic factors could be considered when determining better treatment options. However, there is a paucity of data on risk stratification for early-stage bulky tumors to guide treatment modality. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the difference in clinical outcomes in patients who were grouped by their different prognoses between surgery and primary chemoradiation.",

            "text": "For this imaging modality, we initially filtered out images with high saturation or low contrast, resulting in a total of 529 usable images. Subsequently, a total of 2,209 masks from frontal, sagittal, and axial MRI images were generated using the algorithm described in Section II-C. A summary of the data produced by the algorithm is presented in Table II. \n\nNext, we investigated the correlation between segmentation values derived from the masks of 12 patients with sagittal images, 12 with frontal images, and 13 with axial images. The process began by calculating the mean of the extracted values for each mask, weighted by the number of pixels it contained. Figure 3 displays the resulting trend line and correlation coefficient, specifically examining the relationship between bone tumor lesion mask values and soft tissue lesion mask values. This analysis indicates a connection between tumor growth and cell densification on one hand, and edema and muscle tissue damage on the other. Additionally, the summary suggests that this relationship is influenced by an aggressiveness index, which reflects both the speed of tumor growth and the duration that surrounding edema persists before it densifies. Furthermore, data from 18 patients were evaluated by calculating extramedullary tumor expansion into the muscle zone, with images individually scaled and measured using ImageJ. Figures 4a and 4b illustrate the measurement and scale-setting process, as applied to the case of an 18-yearold male patient. Femur length was estimated based on each patient's sex and age to ensure accurate scaling. \n\nBased on the observed correlations, surgical safety margins were determined at 0.25 cm intervals. Table III presents these values, with categories IIB, IB, and IIA considered according to Enneking's staging system [7] and assessed directly on the bone lesion due to their high aggressiveness and potential for new tumor growth. The analysis showed a highly linear rela-   tionship between bone lesion damage and adjacent soft tissue, with a data fit exceeding 92%. This enables the prediction of tissue damage progression based on tumor size and staging.",

As indicated in Table 2, distant metastases were noted in 19.5% (49/251) of surgery group patients and 28.6% (73/255) of PORT group patients, demonstrating a significant difference (p < 0.001).

In contrast, locoregional recurrence (54.2% vs. 9.4%, p < 0.001) and anastomosis recurrence (6.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.03) were more frequently observed in the surgery group compared to the PORT group.

Tumours are categorised into three broad categories-(1) surgically resectable disease (includes selected stage III tumours), ( 2) locally (T3-T4) and/or regionally (N2-N3) advanced disease, and (3) distant metastatic disease. It states that select patients with N2 disease (and T3 disease) can be considered for resection alongside neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy. Other specific stage IIIA tumours defined as being candidates for surgery are superior sulcus tumours (Pancoast tumours) and tumours that invade the chest wall. The importance of lymph node evaluation for accurate staging and resulting increased survival is highlighted, but this relates only to stage I disease, and no evidence pertaining to stage III N2 disease is included. CT, MRI, and PET imaging, as well as invasive staging techniques, are discussed, and the importance of identifying metastatic disease accurately to avoid unnecessary surgery. This suggests that accurate staging is an important step in deciding on resectability of the tumour; however, once a tumour is deemed to be metastatic, it would no longer be classified as stage III, so this does not help decide on resectability of stage III N2 disease. Treatment options for resectable tumours are highlighted, in terms of neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemo/ radiotherapy, but there is no mention of how to initially categorise whether those stage IIIA N2 tumours are resectable or not. The evidence referenced is not recent (2005,2009,2011) and largely focuses on the benefits of surgery and surgical technique regarding lymph node sampling vs resection. The evidence frequently highlights that current treatment options are not satisfactory, and the importance of recruiting patients for clinical trials.",

            "text": "Currently, the main processes for treating gastric cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.(1,2) Among those treatments, surgery is considered the only curative treatment. (3,4) Surgery requires radical resection with appropriate lymph node resection, and some patients require neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (4,5) Therefore, it is very important that each patient is accurately staged preoperatively to ensure the appropriate treatment program and surgical extent is selected. Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography are considered the standard imaging modalities in gastric cancer. (6)(7)(8)(9) However, endoscopic ultrasonography cannot be used to evaluate the lymph nodes except the perigastric nodes, although it can be used to detect T stage and perigastric lymph nodes. (10) CT scans have sensitivity issues in the detection of small metastatic lymph nodes, and specificity issues in the detection of lymph nodes enlarged due to inflammation. (5) Additionally, a previous study found that 23% of cases that had no distant metastases on preoperative clinical and imaging studies did in fact show distal metastases during surgery. (11) Therefore other alternative, non-invasive modalities are needed in addition to the established standard imaging modalities to facilitate accurate preoperative staging. The use of 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as a routine preoperative modality is increasing. Thus, we aimed to determine the usefulness of preoperative PET-CT scans for staging and predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. To determine the utility of PET-CT for gastric cancer staging, we assessed the relationship between T stage and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, the sensitivity and specificity for N staging, the sensitivity for pathologic classification, and the relationships among carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and FDG uptake. We used SPSS for Windows (ver.",

            "text": "Its treatment depends on patient factors such as age, comorbidities (as a whole life expectancy) and patient's wishes, as well as on tumor characteristics such as clinical stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen value. Currently, most cases are diagnosed in early stages, where several therapeutic options are available, side effects influence the therapeutic decision. In general, in early stages of low risk, patients can be monitored, operated or receive medical treatment based on hormone therapy or radiotherapy, depending on their life expectancy; in intermediate and high risk stages, radiotherapy is part of the standard management, either as radical treatment, alone or in conjunction with hormone therapy, or as adjuvant or salvage treatment after surgery. \n\nIn the case of radiotherapy treatment, technological advances have made it possible to have highly sophisticated image acquisition and treatment equipment, as well as planning systems that allow dose escalation using highly conformal techniques; however, increasing the dose also increases the risk of toxicity in healthy peripheral tissues as well as the probability of geometric uncertainties leading to underdosing in the target volume. \n\nTherefore, a series of factors must be considered to optimize the precision of treatment administration, in order to distribute the dose in therapeutic volumes and limit it in organs at risk (OAR), such as the rectum and bladder. \n\nImage-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can be defined as the use of image acquisition to increase precision and accuracy throughout radiation therapy treatment, resulting in modification of positioning or anatomical parameters to reduce geometric uncertainty, improve therapeutic goals and/or decrease the risk of associated morbidity, Therefore, the Mexican Society of Radiation Oncologists (SOMERA) board during 2020-2022 decided to evaluate the current situation regarding the IGRT use in one of the most prevalent cancers in our country, considering that prostate cancer benefits from both dose escalation and limiting this high dose to the surrounding tissues such as the rectum and bladder, and the improvement in the quoted therapeutic index is facilitated by IGRT. It is of paramount importance to find out first if is performed across the country and under which circumstances and, then, how it is made and what actions are taken with the data obtained. Finally based on that information, SOMERA will suggest recommendations about its implementation and optimal use.",

            "text": "Primary ovarian tumors are divided into epithelial, mesenchymal, sex cord-stromal, or germ cell origin. Most of malignant ovarian tumors are epithelial origin, which are sub-classified into serous, mucinous, clear cell, and endometrioid carcinomas [1,2]. The biological behavior of these subtypes and patients' prognoses, particularly sensitivity to chemotherapy, are quite different from one another [3]. Serous carcinoma (SC) is the most common subtype of epithelial ovarian carcinoma and also known for its sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. On the other hand, the 5-year survival rate of mucinous carcinoma (MC) [3] and clear cell carcinoma (CCC) [4,5] is significantly poorer than that of serous carcinoma. The current standard treatment for epithelial ovarian carcinoma is primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy [6,7]. With this treatment, clinicians can determine the subtype of ovarian carcinoma before starting chemotherapy. In the past several years, however, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) has become more commonly performed as an alternative treatment option [8]. With this type of treatment, clinicians often have to start chemotherapy based only upon the cytological diagnosis, in which the pathological subtype of the carcinoma is unclear. However, ineffective NAC may narrow the range of therapeutic window of the patients and physicians prefer to choose PDS for patients with chemo-resistive subtypes. Therefore, it may be meaningful to estimate the subtype of ovarian carcinoma using an imaging modality.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to study whether we can determine subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer by using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the clinical findings, including the tumor marker and paraneoplastic syndrome such as venous thrombosis or hypercalcemia, to support NAC.",

            "text": "The meta-analysis conducted in this study elucidates the following key findings: (1) For cervical cancer patients at stage IA2 and those with negative LVSI, no significant differences were found between the SH and RH groups in terms of OS, DFS, CCSS, RR, and mortality, indicating that the type of surgery does not affect the long-term survival outcomes for these patients. (2) For patients at stage IB1 or IA2 with positive LVSI, although no significant differences were observed between the SH and RH groups in OS, DFS, CCSS, and recurrence rate, a notable increase in mortality was observed in the SH group, suggesting that the type of surgery may increase the mortality risk for these patients. (3) In terms of safety, the SH group experienced significantly fewer surgery-related complications compared to the RH group. Significantly, among patients in the SH group, an increase in the rate of postoperative adjuvant treatment is associated with a higher occurrence of treatment-related complications. Therefore, when choosing surgical treatment options for early-stage cervical cancer patients, a comprehensive consideration of the specific characteristics of the case is essential, including the staging of the tumor, LVSI status, the patient's personal preferences, and the expected progression of the disease, among other factors. Through a thorough assessment and careful weighing of the pros and cons, clinicians can furnish patients with an evidence-based and personalized treatment plan. Such an approach not only maximizes treatment efficacy but also reduces surgery-related complications, thereby benefiting early-stage cervical cancer patients to the greatest extent. Future research will be directed towards how to more accurately select patients suitable for less extensive surgery, which will become a key area of study in this field.",

The planning of radiotherapy target volume is guided by clinical stage and very much influenced by diagnostic imaging findings that allow the delineation of local tumor extension and the identification of pelvic and paraaortic nodal involvement before radiotherapy [34,35].

            "text": "The rate of lymph node metastasis from superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has a close relationship to depth of invasion by the cancer [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. According to Japanese guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer [8], indications for treatment are as follows: an absolute indication for endoscopic resection (ER): EP/LPM cancers; a relative indication for ER: MM/SM1 cancers; and surgical resection/chemoradiotherapy: SM2 cancers. It was reported that the complication rate of surgery for esophageal SCC is 41.9 %, with morbidity and mortality rates of 13.3 % and 1.2 % to 3.4 %, respectively [9]. Specifically, surgery has a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preoperative diagnosis especially focusing on the endoscopic diagnosis of the depth of invasion by the cancer is pertinent to determine the therapeutic strategy.\n\nFurthermore, differential diagnosis between EP-SM1 and SM2 cancers is particularly important to determine whether less invasive ER or invasive surgical treatment should be performed. Magnifying endoscopy with image-enhanced technique is reported to be useful for diagnosis of depth of invasion of superficial esophageal SCC [10,11]. According to the magnifying endoscopic classification of the Japan Esophageal Society (JES) [12], the B3 vessels, which are highly dilated abnormal vessels with a caliber often larger than 60 \u03bcm (\u25b6 Fig. 1), are described to be characteristic of SM2 cancers. The specificity of the B3 vessels as a marker for SM2 cancer is high. However, sensitivity was extremely low, which remains an issue [13][14][15].\n\nIn a previous study, Arima et al. reported that the vessels, which are visualized by magnifying endoscopy in cancers with muscularis mucosae or deeper invasion, were dilated and branched out from their origin and formed multiple layers [11]. Similarly, we noticed that irregularly branched microvessels are frequently identified by magnifying end",

SCC is the most common histological type of esophageal cancer worldwide, with a higher incidence in developing nations. With the increased prevalence of GERD and obesity in developed nations, the incidence of EAC has dramatically increased in the past 40 years. Esophageal cancer is staged according to the widely accepted TNM system. Staging plays an integral part in guiding stage specific treatment protocols and has a great impact on overall survival. Common imaging modalities used in staging include CT, EUS and PET scans. Current treatment options include multimodality therapy mainstays of current treatment include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Tumor markers of esophageal cancer are an advancing area of research that could potentially lead to earlier diagnosis as well as playing a part in assessing tumor response to therapy.",

The purpose of further imaging these lesions includes a) identification of the origin, b) differentiation of benign from malignant tumors and c) differentiation of benign lesions that warrant intervention from those that do not. Characterisation of an adnexal mass by MRI is based upon morphologic features, signal characteristics and perfusion. In indeterminate masses, a diagnostic algorithm will be presented, which depends on the findings using standard MRI with T1 and T2WI. Such lesions are divided into the three following categories: a mass bright on T1, a mass dark on T2WI and a cystic solid mass. Depending on these features further characterisation is possible by using additional sequences including fat saturation, chemical shift imaging or contrast enhanced imaging. CT staging, especially multislice CT, is the modality of choice for staging ovarian cancer. The prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer is still related to the tumor stage at laparoscopy and residual tumor after cytoreductive surgery. Nevertheless, tumor debulking is not always possible because of the tumor extent and planning surgery might be difficult. Thus, the three roles of imaging are to select the candidates for primary chemotherapy if the lesions are nonresectable, to determine the best sites for biopsies in case of peritoneal carcinomatosis, and to help to define the therapeutic strategies in a multidisciplinary approach. Resectability on imaging depends on two major factors, lesion size and location. The imaging criteria for predicting nonresectable disease must be known and include abdominal wall invasion, retroperitoneal presacral disease, lymph node involvement above the renal hilum, peritoneal implants 2 cm (porta hepatis, intersegmental fissure, gastrosplenic and gastrohepatic ligaments, diaphragm) and invasion of small bowel mesentery. CT staging must include chest, abdominal and pelvic images to detect also distant metastasis. In case of nonrespectable lesion, the treatment must begin with primary chemotherapy in order to allow debulking surgery. Nevertheless, sensitivity of CT is still low in detecting small peritoneal implants ( 2 cm)",

            "text": "Radiotherapy is an effective modality for reducing the recurrence rate and breast cancer mortality after breastconserving surgery [1,2]. Based on the spatial pattern of recurrence, partial breast irradiation (PBI) can be introduced as an alternative to conventional whole-breast irradiation followed by boost in selected patients with early breast cancer, aiming for a short treatment time and reduced toxicity. Several randomized trials and recent meta-analyses have reported comparable oncologic outcomes with PBI [3][4][5][6]. As more evidence is accumulated, the scope of indications for PBI is expanding [7]. \n\nIn PBI, defining the optimal target volume is crucial to thoroughly cover the area at risk and to simultaneously minimize toxicity. The target volume of PBI is defined as tissues surrounding the tumor bed [8]. After superficial closure of the excision cavity, the tumor bed often appears as a seroma [9,10], which makes target definition more clear and consistent. Seroma volume (SV) is well-known to typically shrink with time [11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Therefore, an ideal target volume should differ in each PBI fraction. Several studies have reported the benefits of adaptive planning of tumor bed boost concomitant with or following whole-breast irradiation [18][19][20][21], and reducing the treatment volume by replanning in PBI is also likely to improve normal tissue protection. \n\nIn light of the seroma definition and re-imaging for adaptive radiotherapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has several advantages over computed tomography (CT). MRI provides improved visibility of the seroma [22], facilitating both the delineation of the tumor bed and the monitoring of its volume, whereas breast parenchyma may prevent the clear visualization of seromas in CT. The lack of radiation exposure is another advantage of MRI. Therefore, the MRI-guided technique is believed to be superior to conventional CT-based radiotherapy in PBI. However, because MRI is not routinely exploited in breast cancer, to date no studies have focused on MRI-based SV changes during PBI.",

Several randomized trials and recent meta-analyses have reported comparable oncologic outcomes with PBI [3][4][5][6]. As more evidence is accumulated, the scope of indications for PBI is expanding [7]. \n\nIn PBI, defining the optimal target volume is crucial to thoroughly cover the area at risk and to simultaneously minimize toxicity.

            "text": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a disease that most often affects post-menopausal women who present abdominal discomfort and bloating over a fewmonths prior to detection. Themajority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease as the early stages are commonly asymptomatic (Jayson et al., 2014). According to Global Cancer Statistics 2020, OC is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide accounting for around 314,000 new cases (3.4% of all new cancer cases in females) annually (Sung et al., 2021). In 2021 it established itself as the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst Australian women with 1720 new cases and 1,042 reported deaths (www. canceraustralia.gov.au). Prognosis is significantly determined by the stage of diagnosis where survival for stages I, II, III and IV is 73\u201392%, 45\u201355%, 21% and <6%, respectively, underscoring the need for better early detection of ovarian cancer. There are four main types of OC: epithelial, Germ cell, sex chord and stromal, with each having different epidemiological statistics, and with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounting for approximately 90% of all cases (Smith et al., 2006). In EOC there are histological subtypes, though most patients have high-grade serous ovarian cancer, a disease characterised by p53 gene abnormalities (K\u00f6bel, 2010). Some high grade serous ovarian cancers are caused by deleterious mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, while others arise from a combination of somatic mutations (Network, 2011). The most common and effective management of the disease is a combination of surgery with chemotherapy. Surgical removal of cancer mass almost always occurs after diagnosis however, this is not always feasible when the cancer is very advanced. Furthermore, although surgery has proven effective in early stages of the disease, most patients diagnosed at advanced stages will go on to develop many iterations of recurrent disease (Jayson et al., 2014). Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) and trans-vaginal imaging are currently routinely used as part of ovarian cancer diagnosis. Blood",

Patients were included if they had staging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis and had nonmetastatic, clinical stage T3/T4, and/or N+ disease. The primary tumor had to be located between 9 and 20 cm from the AV either on imaging, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy. We included patients who had definitive surgery (abdominoperineal resection, total or partial colectomy, or low anterior resection), with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, and who underwent chemotherapy. \n\nWe collected available data from the medical chart on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment details. We classified the primary tumor location using distance from the AV as well as relationship to the PR and sacral promontory. If any part of the tumor was straddling the PR or sacral promontory, it was characterized as \"straddle\". For tumors characterized as \"above\" or \"below\" the anatomic landmarks, the entire length of the tumor had to be above or below the PR or sacral promontory. The sacral promontory was defined as a plane drawn from the promontory to the pubic symphysis. 15 The peritoneum was identified in the midsagittal plane as a thin, hypointense line along with the superior bladder in men or the uterus in women that extends inferiorly and posteriorly to approximately the tip of the seminal vesicles in men and the cul-de-sac in women, after which the posterior extension attaches to the rectal wall anteriorly. 16 Board certified radiologists with an expertise in gastrointestinal malignancies reviewed the staging imaging for positive or close circumferential margins. High specificity of up to 92% for prediction of margins by MRI by radiologists with experience in gastrointestinal and MRI have been previously described in a prospective observational study. 17 argins were described as close or threatened if the tumor was <2 mm from the mesorectal fascia.",

            "text": "Imaging phenotypes extracted via radiomics of magnetic resonance imaging have shown great potential in predicting the treatment response in breast cancer patients after administering neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Understanding the causal relationships between the treatment response and Imaging phenotypes, Clinical information, and Molecular (ICM) features are critical in guiding treatment strategies and management plans. Counterfactual explanations provide an interpretable approach to generating causal inference. However, existing approaches are either computationally prohibitive for high dimensional problems, generate unrealistic counterfactuals, or confound the effects of causal features by changing multiple features simultaneously. This paper proposes a new method called Sparse CounteRGAN (SCGAN) for generating counterfactual instances to reveal causal relationships between ICM features and the treatment response after NST. The generative approach learns the distribution of the original instances and, therefore, ensures that the new instances are realistic. We propose dropout training of the discriminator to promote sparsity and introduce a diversity term in the loss function to maximize the distances among generated counterfactuals. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, followed by the breast cancer dataset, and compare their performance with existing methods in the literature. Results show that SCGAN generates sparse and diverse counterfactual instances that also achieve plausibility and feasibility, making it a valuable tool for understanding the causal relationships between ICM features and treatment response. Note to Practitioners\u2014 Determining the suitability of NST for a breast cancer patient before surgery is complex and depends on factors such as patient demographics, tumor characteristics, clinical history, and molecular subtypes. Understanding the causal relationships between different features and pathologic responses to NST may lead to opportunities for targeted therapies and help oncologists make informed decisions about continuing or limiting systemic therapy after the initial consultation. The lack of causal explanations in traditional machine learning models for predicting NST has limited their applicability in clinical decision-making. SCGAN proposed in this paper overcomes the limitations of existing methods in generating causal inference via counterfactual explanations. This approach helps identify causal relationships between imaging phenotypes, clinical history, molecular features, and pathologic response to NST. The resulting information can aid in developing personalized treatment plans for patients and ultimately improve patient",

            "text": "G astric cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in the world. Despite recent developments in gastric cancer treatment, the cumulative 5-year survival rate is considerably low (1). Gastric cancer is an invasive disease that can hardly be clinically diagnosed in its early stages. Most patients are diagnosed with limited survival in the advanced stage due to metastatic disease (2). In the early stage, gastric cancer is asymptomatic and can be treated while it is only a local disease if an early diagnosis is made (3). Gastric cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second most frequent among women in some Middle East countries (4). It is necessary to diagnose gastric cancer when it is still a local disease by considering clinical symptoms such as weight loss, loss of appetite (anorexia), indigestion, postprandial fullness, nausea, and vomiting (5,6). Treatment of gastric cancer requires surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be performed in advanced stages to alleviate the symptoms. As the early diagnosis may improve survival, assessment and identification of gastric cancer stages are prominent (7). Preoperative gastric cancer staging includes imaging, cytological assessment of ascites (if present), laparoscopy, and peritoneal lavage. There has been a strong association between elevated levels of CEA and the presence of malignant cells in ascites fluid, which indicates poor prognosis and invasive disease in patients with gastric cancer. However, there is not much information on this correlation in non-ascitic patients (8,9). Peritoneal lavage aims to diagnose the microscopic presence of tumor cells on the peritoneal surface in patients without ascites. In our study, the peritoneal lavage fluid was evaluated based on CEA level and cytology to assess its relationship to the stage of gastric cancer in non-ascites patients.",

Incidence and treatment data was gathered using SEER data from the original 9 SEER registries: Atlanta, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, San Francisco-Oakland, Seattle-Puget Sound, and Utah. Monthly, age-adjusted (2000 US Standard Population) rates per population of 100,000, of incidence and treatment during the years 1973 to 2008 were calculated. Rates were evaluated for all cancers, as well as breast and pancreatic cancers specifically. Stage-specific incidence rates of breast cancer (in situ, localized, regional, and distant) were obtained after the overall incidence analysis showed a relationship between unemployment and incidence. Treatment modalities evaluated included radiotherapy and surgery. All forms of radiotherapy were included in the radiation therapy category, and all types of surgery were included in the surgery category. Radiotherapy for breast cancer data between the years 1990-2000 was excluded because of the marked increase in the use of lumpectomy and radiotherapy as an alternative to mastectomy during that time period. SEER did not collect data regarding chemotherapy at its inception; therefore, this data could not be included in the analysis. The web-based program, SEER*Stat, on the SEER website, and SAS Version 9.3 were both used to analyze the data. \n\nTo control for socioeconomic factors, the data was analyzed at the county level, dividing counties into quartiles based on both median household income and percent of population with high school or greater education. This yielded 16 socioeconomic groups. The data across all counties within the same quartile education and income rankings were combined. These data were then further divided into three racial groups (white, African-American (AA), other), yielding 48 groups. Some combinations of racial and socioeconomic factors had no data and were excluded from the analyses. These factors were then used to build multivariate linear mixed regression models to determine their influence on the relationship between cancer diagnosis/treatment and unemployment.",

            "text": "With 1.82 million incidences in 2012, lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide (Ferlay et al 2014). Also, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality, with 1.6 million deaths globally (Ferlay et al 2014). Depending on the patient's prognosis, different treatment modalities can be used to treat the disease, including surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy. According to Lambin et al (2017), personalising treatment for every patient can improve patient outcome. \n\nPersonalised treatment relies on medical imaging (European Society of Radiology 2015). Imaging plays an important role in the pathway of lung cancer management; it is used to diagnose the disease, in staging, to plan RT, assess treatment response and to verify patient's position before treatment using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Information obtained from on-treatment images during RT is currently used to inform treatment adaptation, which in lung cancer patients is typically restricted to response to changes in the tumour position. Larger changes may have a dosimetric impact on the tumour coverage or organs at risk (OARs), and offline replanning can correct for these changes. \n\nThe majority of the published work on lung cancer has reported a correlation between the gross tumour volume (GTV) before the start of RT and overall survival using CT or PET/CT (K\u00e4smann et al 2018). However, the results of GTV volume changes during RT were contradicting. For example, Jabbour et al (2015) and Brink et al (2014) suggested a correlation between the sub-groups of tumour volume change and overall survival. However, a recent study of 394 patients, found that three sub-groups of GTV volume change during treatment did not differ in their outcomes (Kwint et al 2020). Most studies used computed tomography or positron-emission tomography images at selected timepoints to assess tumour changes (Roengvoraphoj et al 2018). \n\nImage-guided RT has become a standard of care, using CBCT to verify and correct a patient's position before treatment (Jaffray et al 2002).",

            "text": "We used the esophageal cancer staging system. Based on the gastric TNM staging system, if the tumor had broken through the serosa, it would be very difficult to define the T stage. Furthermore, there is already a high degree of lymph node tumors in T4 stage Siewert type II AEG. \n\nA reliable nomogram would greatly improve the accuracy of N staging, allow for a more accurate prognosis prediction, and guide intraoperative treatments. Analysis using ROC and the calibration curve showed an improved prediction system of our nomogram. However, if the data incorporated in this study had obtained more accurate values of tumor invasion depth, differentiation degree, and TS before surgery, the clinical application value of our nomogram would have been greatly improved. At present, computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound are commonly used to diagnose LNM prior to surgery. However, the sensitivity of computed tomography is low, and endoscopic ultrasound is not useful for distant lymph nodes. Furthermore, preoperative examination surveys lymph nodes based on lymph node size, which is in fact interfered from adhesion of the lymph node to surrounding tissues and the degree of inflammation [10,11,30]. In general, clinical N staging currently lacks a more effective and practical detection method. Easily obtained data was used to build a LNM prediction model, and its accuracy was not affected by inflammatory status or lymph node size. As exact TS can be detected by endoscopic ultrasound imaging, it is unaffected by local inflammation and surrounding tissues. Many studies [11,31,32] have shown that endoscopic ultrasound has an advantage in diagnosing the depth of Siewert type II AEG invasion, however, this method cannot distinguish between T1a and T1b stages. This accuracy is clearly enough to identify the depth of Siewert type II AEG invasion. \n\nPatients commonly undergo routine endoscopic biopsy to confirm the tumor and grade of the tumor. However, it is entirely possible to obtain tumor invasion depth, grade, and TS data before surgery, which allows for the incorporation of this nomogram to predict LNM, and further improve the predictive accuracy of LNM by imaging examination.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer according to worldwide incidences statistics.The conventional treatment strategy for colorectal cancer typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.The specific treatment plan depends on several factors, including the stage of cancer, the location of the tumor, and the overall health of the patient (1,2).The correct diagnosis of colorectal cancer leads to the indication of the most adequate treatments for cancer-affected patients.The diagnosis is made through the visual analysis of tissue samples by pathologists.However, this analysis is susceptible to intra-and inter-pathologists' variability in addition to being a complex and time-consuming task (3).\n\nFluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is commonly used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for the evaluation of colorectal cancer (4).\n\nThe 18F-FDG PET is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows for the visualization of metabolic activity within the body.18F-FDGPET is usually performed in conjunction with a CT scan, which provides detailed anatomic information about the body.The combined information from the FDG PET and CT scans can provide a more complete picture of cancer and help guide the treatment plan.18-FDGPET/CT can be used for staging, monitoring treatment response, detecting recurrence, and differentiating colorectal cancer from other conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nSUV max (maximum standardized uptake value) is a commonly used parameter in 18F-FDG PET imaging to quantify the level of 18F-FDG uptake in a particular region of interest within the body.In colorectal cancer, higher SUVmax values in the affected area are generally associated with higher levels of metabolic activity, which can indicate the presence of cancer (5).\n\nHigher SUV max values have been found to be associated with higher histologic grades, larger tumor size, and more advanced stages of the disease.Some studies have even shown that SUVmax can be used as a predictor of malignancy in colorectal cancer and can help to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions.",

            "text": "Cancer prognosis is a critical component in the clinical management of patients, guiding treatment strategies and offering insights into survival outcomes [1]. In the standard clinical practice for numerous cancers, doctors manually examine histological aspects of tumors, including their invasiveness, cellular abnormalities, tissue death, and cell division rates [2][3][4]. These evaluations help in grading and staging cancer, which classifies patients into risk categories to inform treatment choices [5,6]. For example, the TNM system evaluates the primary tumor's characteristics like size, progression, and abnormality to assign a stage [7]. This stage inf luences decisions on treatment plans, surgery eligibility, radiation therapy levels, and other therapeutic approaches. However, it has been shown that the subjective evaluation of pathological features can be quite inconsistent, with significant differences in assessments between different observers and even within the same observer over time. As a result, patients classified in the same grade or stage may experience notably diverse treatment outcomes [8]. During the past years, to fully exploit the hidden information of histopathological images, a number of computational approaches have been developed to retrieve a wealth of features from these images [9][10][11][12]. These features that quantitatively capture the cellular characteristics such as size, form, arrangement, and texture were used to predict the patient survival [13]. Alternatively, other methodologies leverage genomic data to forecast cancer survival rates. This is because cancer is intimately linked to genetic mutations and irregular gene expression that disrupt standard cell functions and biological mechanisms [14]. Therefore, delving into genomic data is highly pertinent for predicting cancer survival [15][16][17]. \n\nThose traditional prognostic models, relying primarily on clinical parameters and unimodal data sources, have made significant contributions to oncology but are increasingly recognized as limited in their ability to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of cancer [18,19]. As medical data continue to accumulate, the evolution of precision medicine demands a more nuanced understanding, necessitating the integration of diverse data types, including genomics, histopathology, and clinical data [20,21].",

It is a growing health concern that is expected to increase in incidence over the next 10 years. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological type of esophageal cancer worldwide, with a higher incidence in developing nations. With the increased prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease and obesity in developed nations, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has dramatically increased in the past 40 years. Esophageal cancer is staged according to the widely accepted TNM system. Staging plays an integral part in guiding stage specific treatment protocols and has a great impact on overall survival. Common imaging modalities used in staging include computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound and positron emission tomography scans. Current treatment options include multimodality therapy mainstays of current treatment include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Tumor markers of esophageal cancer are an advancing area of research that could potentially lead to earlier diagnosis as well as playing a part in assessing tumor response to therapy.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that LABC has been treated for 100 years (3). Radical surgery has been considered to be the standard treatment for many types of breast cancer, including LABC. However, other preoperative systemic therapies, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy are now widely used as standard treatments for LABC patients (2). Previous studies reported that nomograms can predict the survival time of patients with different stages of breast cancer (26, 27). However, there is no reliable tool for predicting OS and CSS in LABC patients. \n\nThe survival times of patients with different cancers vary significantly. Moreover, patients with the same type of cancer and TNM stage may have different survival outcomes, indicating that the TNM staging system is not an ideal prediction parameter for all cancer patients (28). Patients with positive regional lymph nodes status without T-stage intervention are classified as stage IIB, stage IIIA, and stage IIIC, whereas those with negative regional lymph nodes status, stage T3 and T4 are categorized as stage IIB and stage IIIB, respectively, based on the 7th edition of the AJCC staging system. In this study, we found that patients with stage IIIB had worse survival outcomes than those with stage IIIC, indicating that the T stage has a greater impact on LABC survival compared with the N stage. This is consistent with the rectal cancer model predictions (29). Therefore, a robust prognostic indicator or tool is needed to guide individualized treatment of LABC patients (24). In the present study, risk stratification was performed to differentiate the prognosis of LABC patients and provide a more accurate basis for decision-making regarding LABC treatment. \n\nAfter Lasso regression analysis of 12 relevant clinical characteristics of LABC patients in the SEER database, nine variables were screened including age at diagnosis, marital status, grade, subtype, T-stage, N-stage, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. It has been reported that older patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and rectal cancer have a poor prognosis (29,30). Similarly, we found that elderly LABC patients had a poor prognosis.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern as it accounts for 10% of all tumor types worldwide. It stands as the fourth most prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality, contributing to an estimated 600,000 deaths annually [1,2]. \n\nEarly-stage CRC (Stage I or II) is typically localized and has a better prognosis [3,4]. Treatment for localized CRC involves the surgical resection of the tumor. The specific surgical approach and extent of surgery depend on tumor location and size [5]. In certain situations [6], adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. The prognosis for patients with localized CRC is generally favorable and primarily relies on the initial cancer stage [7,8]. At a localized stage, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90%. However, it decreases to 70.4% for patients with regional involvement and further drops to 12.5% for patients with metastasis [8,9]. \n\nPrimary staging holds crucial significance as it helps determine the appropriate treatment plan and furnishes essential prognostic information. In current clinical practices, staging is achieved through a combination of clinical evaluation, conventional imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic assessment including colonoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound, and the pathological examination of biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopy or surgery [3,4]. \n\nAlthough 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting both the primary tumor and distant metastases, its initial use seems to have moderate influence on patient management [10][11][12][13][14], and presently, it is not included in the international guidelines for the initial preoperative staging of CRC [3]. 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed low sensitivity in detecting locoregional lymph node metastases, often due to the proximity of metastatic lymph nodes to the primary tumor, making it difficult to distinguish them from the colonic lesion [10,15,16].",

The high incidence of prostate cancer, combined with earlier detection and downstaging at the time of diagnosis, and slow natural progression and biological heterogeneity of the disease has made its management a complex and controversial issue. Prostate tumours have a slow growth rate and allow for prolonged survival 2 . The downstaging resulting from prostatic serum antigen (PSA) screening has been accompanied by an unfortunate trend of over detection and over treatment of biologically indolent (low-grade, clinically insignificant) disease. Primary therapies with curative intent (surgery or radiation) provide excellent long-term cancer control, but accompanied by a risk of treatment -related morbidity 2 . The real challenge for physicians is to differentiate patients with advanced cancer and increased risk of morbidity/ mortality from those who will not require immediate or possibly delayed and therapeutic intervention 2 . There are a number of clinical parameters and clinical nomograms to help with the choice of treatment. Defining low risk is the value of prostate serum antigen (PSA) less than 10ng/ mL, Gleason score of 6 and lower, T stage of T2a or lower. High risk is define as PSA value of more than 20ng/mL, Gleason score of 8 or higher or T2c, intermediate risk is defined as PSA of 10-20ng/mL, T2b, Gleason score of 7. The Partin staging nomogram is based on clinical stage, Gleason score, serum PSA level, nomograms are widely used for giving a prediction of the final pathologic stage, disease recurrence and estimate of biological potential. Other types of nomogram, such as Kattan\u00b4s nomograms have been developed to predict stage, recurrence, biological potential 3 . Nomograms are limited by the lack of results from imaging studies that could guide interventions to control local disease. A sensitive and specific enough imaging modality is needed to help differentiate between patients with insignificant disease and patients in need of treatment. This might also decrease the need for biopsies or significantly lower the number of biopsy cores needed.",

However, the majority of cancers are detected during their late stages, when treatment opportunities are limited, resulting in poor survival [4]. Therefore, there is a need to utilize more novel approaches for cancer management that allow the targeting of cancer cells without causing harm to normal cells.\n\nThe general approaches for cancer management and therapy lie in destroying or removing cancer cells, either via surgery, irradiation, or chemotherapy. The combination of these approaches shows many benefits for improving a cancer patient's quality of life and increasing their survival rate.\n\nEach approach has is important in its own way. Surgery plays multiple roles in cancer management, including prophylaxis if the organ is not crucial for survival; diagnosis, by taking a biopsy from a cancer patient; staging and measuring the extent of the tumor, including allowing the determination of the type of tumor, the growth extent, the size, the nodal involvement and the tumor distance and regional spread; as a definitive or curative treatment, by removing the entire tumor and the lymph nodes that are associated with it; as palliative care to reduce the symptoms and distress; as an adjuvant or supportive therapy, such as a tracheostomy and feeding tubes; as a reconstructive or rehabilitative therapy to reduce deformities; and as a salvage treatment for local disease recurrence, such as via a salvage radical cystectomy or mastectomy [5].\n\nRadiation also plays many roles because both cancer cells and normal cells are affected in cancer. The primary function of radiation is as a curative treatment. For example, some cancer types, such as skin cancer, prostate cancer, early stage larynx cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma, can only be cured with the use of radiation. Additionally, radiation serves as a form of adjuvant treatment after definitive surgery or as a palliative treatment. This approach has undergone substantial developments, such as the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT], image guided radiotherapy [IGRT], radioimmunotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS], and stereotactic radiotherapy [SRT] [",

While in the external validation cohorts, clinical T stage, histologic subtype, pathologic stage, distant metastasis, consolidation maximum diameter, spiculated sign, pleural CT subtype, pleural indentation and consolidation contact with the pleura were significant correlated with VPI status. Prior to the construction of a clinical model capable of preoperatively predicting VPI status, univariate logistic regression analyses were employed to identify relevant clinical or radiologic features.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide (1,2). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type, accounting for 80% of all lung cancers (3). Early-stage NSCLC (ES-NSCLC) refers to stages I and II of the disease (4), and over one-fifth of NSCLC cases were detected at ES-NSCLC (5). Surgery is the current standard-of-care treatment strategy for ES-NSCLC (3,6,7), while only approximately 70% of ES-NSCLC patients receive surgical treatment (8,9). The remaining patients opt out of surgery due to medical or technical inoperability or personal preferences (10, 11). Radiation therapy (RT) has emerged as a standard noninvasive alternative to surgical resection (10). RT has been showing promising results in treating ES-NSCLC with high safety and efficiency (11). Nonetheless, the reported 3-year overall survival (OS) rate following RT varies widely, typically ranging from 39% \u00b1 10% (12-14). Therefore, accurate OS prediction is thus crucial for personalizing medical treatment and informing decisions for optimizing therapeutic strategies. \n\nMedical image-based OS prediction has been recently intensively studied and shown promising accuracy (15)(16)(17). Techniques such as radiomics and deep learning analyze image data to identify patterns that may be associated with underlying physiological and pathological conditions. Radiomic analysis, in particular, is a widely used noninvasive imaging quantification method (18). Typically, radiomics first determines the volume-of-interest (VOI), e.g., tumor in OS prediction tasks, and extracts the features that are defined based on experts' domain knowledge to quantitatively capture the intensity, shape, size or volume, and texture information of VOIs, namely handcrafted radiomic features (HRFs) (17,19). The extracted HRFs can be considered as the potential biomarkers that reflect patient underlying pathophysiology, and the classic machine learning classifiers can be employed to establish the correlations between OS and HRFs (20,21).",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide (incidence rate of 10.2%), of which over 700,000 patients will be annually diagnosed with tumors localized to the rectum [1].Those with locally advanced rectal cancer typically receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery, as the standard-of-care treatment protocol in the US [2].While the goal of nCRT is to down-stage rectal tumors prior to surgery (occurring in ~50-60% of rectal tumors [3]), determining the exact extent of tumor regression after nCRT is critical for better personalizing interventions in rectal cancers.For instance, minimally invasive procedures [4] could be adopted in patients exhibiting marked tumor stage regression (T-stage 0-2, with minimal or no tumor extent within the rectal wall), thus reducing associated morbidities of bleeding or infections [5,6].By contrast, chemoradiated tumors which still extend outside of the rectum into the perirectal fat and surrounding structures (T-stage 3-4) need to be accurately targeted for aggressive resection [7] and could be recommended adjuvant therapy to ensure optimal patient survival [8].\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely acquired both prior to as well as following nCRT to non-invasively assess rectal tumor extent in vivo [9].As compared to less routinely used dynamic [10] or diffusion [11] MRI sequences which capture functional information, the clinically standard T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequence offers high-resolution in vivo structural detail of the rectum and surrounding structures (lumen, mesorectum).Under the current protocol where all patients undergo surgery, post-nCRT T2w MRI is used to identify disease extent, plan surgical procedures, and thus guide patient management [9].However, expert restaging of tumor extent on post-nCRT T2w MRI has relatively poor agreement with \"ground truth\" pathologic stage (MRI sensitivity of ~52% when compared to excised specimens) due to the difficulties in visual identification of residual tumor on imaging [12,13].",

            "text": "Pancreatic cancer is a significant health problem worldwide, with a high mortality rate and limited treatment options. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is low, with only 10-20% of patients surviving five years after diagnosis [163]. The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is generally poor, and the disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, making treatment difficult. Treatment options for pancreatic cancer depend on the stage and location of the cancer, as well as other factors such as the patient's overall health. A multidisciplinary team of professionals, including oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists, can help determine the best treatment plan for each individual patient [163]. Today, the only way to survive pancreatic cancer is surgery. The type of surgery depends on the location and extent of the cancer. Pancreatic surgery is challenging with high mortality and morbidity rates, but with the advent of minimally invasive surgery and robotics, outcomes are steadily improving [46]. For pancreatic cancer, surgery is rarely the only treatment but is often combined with adjuvant chemotherapy or, in selected cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In patients who are not candidates for surgery, chemotherapy is the main therapeutic approach [164]. FOLFIRI-NOX, gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine, cisplatin, or nab-paclitaxel are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In selected cases, locoregional therapies may play a role in the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), irreversible electroporation (IRE), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), EUS-guided implantation of fiducial markers, and administration of intratumoral agents have been described, but their role in daily practice remains to be clarified [65]. In addition to survival, quality of life is an important outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the rationale for choosing segmentectomy over lobectomy lies in the potential to preserve parenchyma, especially in functionally compromised patients. However, the trial's reported FEV1 difference between the two groups was only marginal, approximately 2.7% at 6 months and 3.5% at 12 months, in favour of the segmentectomy group. This finding raises doubts about the clinical significance of such a small difference and questions the true advantage of segmentectomy over lobectomy. \n\nIn light of these uncertainties, it is essential to critically assess the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches to ensure that the chosen role of surgery in stage treatment aligns with the best possible outcome for patients. Further research and analysis may be required to fully understand the implications of these findings and to guide treatment decisions effectively. \n\nPatient evaluation remains a fundamental part of the treatment strategy, with the possibility of determining the appropriate therapy in early-stage tumours. Indeed, despite the surgical resection being considered the treatment of choice, other treatments, such as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), may be considered if surgery is refused or if patient comorbidities make the surgical approach extremely risky [10,11]. For this reason, respiratory and cardiac evaluations need to be modulated on patients' characteristics and treatment options, identifying the most appropriate treatment with the highest potential advantage in terms of survival while minimizing the risk of complications [6]. \n\nThis complex approach applies to patients with tumours potentially curable by surgery, an improvement in overall survival. However, in the future, more information on histology, performance status, and stage will indicate the most suitable treatment strategy. \n\nIndeed, in the next future, Artificial Intelligence could integrate and manage complex models based on multi-omics domains (radiological, biological, etc.), providing personalized therapies also suggesting adjuvant or biologic therapy also for early stages [12][13][14]. These advancements may potentially revolutionize the field and further enhance treatment outcomes. \n\nOn the other hand, the role of surgery in stage III patients remains an intriguing and debated issue, even though it is now clear that surgery should be considered only in a multi-disciplinary approach setting, including oncologists or radiotherapists.",

Patients with these risk factors are also candidates for postoperative adjuvant therapy to improve the recurrence rate based on the results of randomized studies reported by Sedlis et al. [7][8][9] However, there have been concerns regarding the potential complications and toxicity related to the combination of surgery and chemoradiotherapy, such as gastrointestinal toxicity and urological complications. 5 10 11 Therefore, some clinicians recommend concurrent chemoradiation therapy as a primary treatment and avoid surgery for those who may require adjuvant postoperative radiation. 12 If the need for postoperative concurrent chemoradiation therapy could be predicted, then concurrent chemoradiation therapy rather than surgery could be selected as the primary treatment option. Subsequently, the morbidity rate may be reduced by avoiding combined therapies.\n\nTumor size is one of the important risk factors that could be measured by imaging exams before initiating treatment. In this retrospective study, we investigated whether tumor size could be a predicting factor for those who may need adjuvant treatment after surgery in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. As a result, the most ideal primary treatment can be selected for certain groups of patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer per the revised 2018 FIGO staging criteria.",

We investigated patterns of care for Belgian NSCLC patients in 2010-2011, based on population-based data from the Belgian Cancer Registry and administrative databases. The relationship between patient characteristics, institutional diagnostic volume, type of treatment and survival was investigated. Overall, 20.8% of patients received no oncological treatment. 59% and 22.1% of Stage I-II patients received primary surgery or (chemo)radiation respectively. 34% of Stage III patients received chemoradiation and 17% of Stage IIIA patients had surgery. 70% of Stage IV patients received chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Moderate variability between centres was observed. For Stage IV, systemic therapy was less frequently used in higher volume centres and 1-year survival was lower in centres that had\u00a0\u2265\u00a050 new patients yearly. Although not all NSCLC patients received treatment as ideally recommended by guidelines, these results do not necessarily represent poor quality of care as patient characteristics and preferences need to be taken into account. Treatment options targeted towards patients with co-morbidity or unfit patients is warranted to improve outcomes of all NSCLC patients.",

            "text": "The clinical tumor size (cT), which is determined by palpation during physical examination or by imaging, is important in determining patient prognosis and treatment (1)(2)(3)(4). Clinical staging determines the necessity of pre-operative chemotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, the methods used to determine tumor size can yield various results, which in turn can affect treatment options and ultimately, patient outcomes. For example, clinical staging based on physical examination is subjective due to the examiner. This method is also not effective for nonpalpable lesions (5). Breast imaging methods, which include mammography, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are less subjective, but also demonstrate certain limitations. The tumor boundary in mammography is often unclear in dense breast tissues, particularly in Asian or young women, and the tumor size may vary depending on the type of mammography performed. Additionally, numerous studies indicate that mammography underestimates the true tumor size compared to the histopathological size (6)(7)(8). By contrast, breast ultrasonography allows for easier measurement of the longest tumor dimension and is strongly correlated with the histopathological size compared to physical examination or mammography, although numerous studies indicate that ultrasonography (USG) also underestimates the tumor size compared with the histopathological size (6,7). \n\nIn contrast to cT, the pathological tumor size (pT) is determined by microscopic measurement of surgical specimens, and accurate pathological tumor staging (T staging) plays a decisive role in determining whether to perform post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. Among biopsy methods, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB), a more recently developed form of core needle biopsy, is now widely used. This biopsy allows complete excision of target lesions, with accuracy similar to that of excisional biopsy. However, the fragmented specimens create certain challenges in histopathological assessment (9). Based on the importance of obtaining reliable information regarding tumor size to accurately determine cancer stage, the purpose of the present study was to investigate any differences between pre-operative clinical T stage and histopathological T stage subsequent to surgery in VABB-diagnosed breast cancer.",

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with T3-T4 and/or node-positive rectosigmoid cancers who underwent surgery from 2006 to 2018 with available pelvic imaging. We included tumors at 9 to 20 cm from the AV on either staging imaging, or colonoscopy. Patients were stratified into those who received neoadjuvant therapy, and those who underwent upfront surgery. Comparisons of characteristics were performed using \u03c72 test and Fischer exact test. Locoregional failure (LRF) and overall survival were compared using Cox regressions and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: One hundred sixty-one patients were included. Ninety-seven patients had neoadjuvant therapy, and 64 patients had upfront surgery. Median follow-up time was 45.1 months. Patients who had neoadjuvant therapy had tumors that were higher cT stage (P<0.01) with more positive/close circumferential resection margins seen on imaging by radiologists (28.9% vs. 1.6%, P=0.015). The 2-year rate of LRF, distant metastases, or overall survival was not significantly different between the 2 groups. None of 15 patients with tumors below the PR treated with neoadjuvant therapy had LRF, but 1 (25%) of 4 patients with tumors below the PR treated with adjuvant therapy experienced LRF (P=0.05). Conclusions: Patients with tumors below the PR may benefit more from neoadjuvant therapy. The PR on imaging may be a reliable landmark in addition to the distance from the AV to determine the most appropriate treatment option.",

            "text": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with over 18 million cases diagnosed globally in 2018 [1]. This is set to rise to over 29 million diagnoses by 2040 [1], and so the continuous development and improvement of cancer treatment remains of high importance. There are several treatment options available to cancer patients, which are typically chosen depending on the type and stage of cancer such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. While many cancer treatments are currently being developed, surgery remains one of the most common treatment options for tumour removal and in the UK ~49% of all patients cured undergo surgical intervention [2]. \n\nDuring cancer surgery it is important that as much of the cancerous tissue is removed as possible while also preventing unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissue [3]. To accomplish this surgeons primarily rely on visual inspection, palpation and previous experience in order to determine the cancerous tissue. While this can be effective for bulk tumour it lacks sensitivity in detecting cancer at the cellular level [4], potentially leading to the patient requiring further surgery if cancerous cells remain in the body. The margin between the cancerous cells and the cut tissue edge is known as the surgical margin, where the current gold standard for margin assessment is slide-based histology. This however has to be completed post-operatively, and is often a time-consuming and laborious process [5]. There are certain techniques currently available for estimating tumour margins intraoperatively, some of which include frozen section histology, intraoperative MRI, CT [6], ultrasound [7] and optical coherence tomography [8]. However these have their own drawbacks and are not in widespread use, where some drawbacks include requiring highly complex and specialized surgical suites for the use of intraoperative MRI and CT in particular, which are also currently limited in their use to neurosurgery [6], as well as other techniques being limited in spatial resolution and contrast compared to post-operative histology [5]. New technologies for intraoperative margin assessment need to be able to match the diagnostic accuracy of post-operative histology and bring further benefits such as reduced turnover times, practicality and reduced cost before they can be considered for routine clinical practice [9].",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (1). According to the global epidemiological data, over 2 million individuals were affected in 2018 (2). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all diagnosed lung cancers; of these, poor prognosis and non-availability of curative treatment worsen the condition in about 75% of patients with metastatic or advanced-stage NSCLC (3)(4)(5). The long-term prognosis of patients with early-stage NSCLC is reportedly satisfactory, with 5-year survival rates after resection of over 70% (6)(7)(8). High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging and low-dose spiral CT imaging help to detect early lung adenocarcinoma (9,10). The Chinese Health Commission's 2018 guidelines for the diagnosis Original Article and treatment of primary lung cancer classifies the imaging examination as an additional diagnostic modality and suggests histopathological examinations. A biopsy can guide the choice of treatment based on histologic type, molecular profiling, tumor involvement, and, more importantly, the patient's health condition (11). \n\nAlthough the therapeutic modalities against lung tumors include various methods such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, surgery remains the treatment of choice since it improves survival rates and reduces treatment-induced adverse effects. Currently, lobectomy remains the standard treatment strategy for patients with early-stage NSCLC (12). Nevertheless, limited resection is often the alternative surgical technique for patients who are not suitable for lobectomy due to advanced age, severely compromised pulmonary function, or other comorbidities (13). Besides, limited resection in earlystage NSCLC is associated with improved lung function preservation and low risk of morbidity and disability, crucial for patients with borderline preoperative cardiopulmonary function (14,15). Currently, segmentectomy and wedge resection are the most common limited resection approaches available.",

            "text": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most common cancer worldwide. With an overall 5-year survival rate of 15-25%, it is the sixth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality [1]. These epidemiological data include both histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is the predominant type [2]. Multimodal therapy combining (neoadjuvant) chemo-/radiotherapy and resection improves the outcome in non-metastatic patients [3]. However, up to 88.9% of the patients develop metastases within 3 years after curative surgery, with a median disease-free interval after surgery of 1 year [4,5,6,7]. Due to limited therapy options, the prognosis after recurrence is extremely poor, with a median survival of 3-7 months [8,9,10]. Moreover, guidelines from the European Soci-ety for Medical Oncology (ESMO) report that palliative chemotherapy for stage IV patients is less effective for SCC than for AC. Cisplatin-based combinations tend to show an increased response rate but no benefit regarding survival; therefore, either best supportive care or monotherapy should be considered in ESCC [11]. In contrast, in various tumor entities metastases limited in number and extent (i.e. oligometastases) are increasingly considered suitable for localized therapy with possible curative intent or at least systemic control, e.g. colorectal cancer [12,13]. Such localized therapy might include surgery but also image-guided local ablation techniques like radiofrequency ablation or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (IBT). However, resection is not possible in majority of patients due to distribution of metastases, contraindications for surgery, or general anesthesia, apart from surgery-associated morbidity and mortality. IBT of parenchymal or-gans is a relatively new technique, where an 192 Iridium source is inserted directly in metastatic lesion through percutaneously implanted applicators, placed in an image-guided minimal invasive intervention, and allowing a well-defined single",

            "text": "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer for women in the United States following skin cancer [1]. \n\nThere is a 12.3% average risk that a woman in the U.S. will get breast cancer in her lifetime. This translates to one in eight women would be diagnosed with breast cancer. Due to advancing preventative measures and improved personalized treatment options, breast cancer survival rates have been steadily increasing [2]. The five-year survival rate is 100% for stage 0 and I breast cancer, 93% for stage II, 72% for stage III, and 22% for stage IV [3]. \n\nSurgery is the treatment of choice for most early-stage breast cancer cases [4]. It is used as a curative treatment option that is done along with chemotherapy, radiation, or hormonal treatment options when indicated. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) was a landmark study in the surgical treatment options of breast cancer [5]. This study along with other consequential studies [6][7][8] have shown that there is no difference between mastectomy vs. lumpectomy alone vs. lumpectomy with radiation when it comes to survival rates [5]. However, the studies showed that the recurrence rates were increased significantly in patients who underwent lumpectomy without radiation. The overall breast cancer recurrence rate of patients who underwent lumpectomy without radiation was 39.2% compared to patients that underwent lumpectomy with radiation who had a recurrence rate of 14.3% [5]. Thus, when comparing mastectomy and the breast-conserving therapy (BCT) of lumpectomy, studies have shown that, in most circumstances, there is no difference in both overall survival and breast cancer recurrence rate [4]. \n\nRecent studies, however, suggest that breast-conserving surgery is associated with increased survival rates for early-stage breast cancer compared to mastectomy [9,10]. When examining these findings, it is important to consider the impact of factors such as socioeconomic status, existing comorbidities, rates of adjuvant chemotherapy, and stage at presentation on one's survival rates.",

            "text": "With the technical advances in thoracic imaging and the use of computed tomography (CT) in screening programs, thoracic surgeons will likely encounter a significant increase in the number of small peripheral lesions of lung cancer. 1 Recent studies have shown that lung cancers detected by CT are mostly classified as stage I and their prognosis is acceptable. 2 The treatment for stage I lung cancer has primarily been surgery. Recently, limited reduction surgery, such as anatomical segmentectomy, has also been performed. However, approximately 20% of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma develop disease recurrence after curative resection. 3 5][6][7][8][9] On the other hand, although it seems that there is no seeding macroscopically, sowing is sometimes microscopically separated from the main lesion, and the invasion pattern of this lung cancer is called tumor spread through alveolar spaces (STAS). 10 STAS is defined as the extension of tumor cells into the pulmonary parenchymal alveolar space beyond the margin of the main tumor. 11 Several reports have indicated that the appearance of STAS is a predictive factor for recurrence and a poor prognosis, 12 even for stage I lung cancer. 13 The existence of STAS can be a problem, especially when treating stage I lung adenocarcinoma with limited resection. If the existence of STAS can be predicted before surgery, unnecessary limited resection can be avoided. \n\nSLX is a cell adhesion protein in the selectin family that adheres to vascular endothelial cells, particularly in target organs of cancer cells. 14 A relationship between serum SLX and lung cancer prognosis has been reported; in tumors with high SLX intensity, the frequency of blood vessel invasion is significantly higher and overall survival is decreased. 15,16 However, the relationship between SLX staining and the existence of STAS is unclear. We hypothesized that higher SLX staining of cancer cells predicts the higher the existence of STAS. This study was performed to determine whether the immunohistochemical intensity of the SLX antigen in the main tumor can predict STASrelated factors, presence, or distance in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma who have undergone lobectomy.",

            "text": "Background Patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are intolerant to surgery have a poor prognosis. Microwave ablation is an effective treatment method. However, the density of the lesion may occasionally be similar to that of the ablation zone, thus rendering it difficult to identify the relative position of the lesion and ablation zone during ablation. This study aimed to use image fusion technology to help confirm the relative position of lesions and ablation zones and to facilitate immediate assessment of the residual lesions. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in Shanghai Ninth People\u2019s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, between August 2019 and August 2021, and consecutively included patients who had undergone computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation for NSCLC. A single radiologist manually fused the intraoperative CT images alignment of the lesions. Two other clinicians examined the postoperative CT images and the fused CT images to determine whether a lesion remained and to measure the minimum ablative margin (MAM). One of the clinicians assessed the complete ablation rate on CT images 6 months after ablation. The Chi-squared test was used to calculate the kappa coefficients between the two investigators. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between each characteristic parameter of the lesion and image quality. The clinicians involved in this study all had over 10 years of work experience. Results Among the 29 participants, comprising 32 lesions retrospectively included (median age 65 years; 41.4% male), the image fusion success rate was 96.88%, and the median fusion time was10 minutes. The rate of accurate recognition for the relative position of pulmonary nodules and ablation zone on original CT images of the two physicians was 7.52% and 12.90%, respectively, while that achieved from the fused CT images was 87.1% and 86.0%, respectively; in agreement testing, the kappa coefficient between the physicians was 0.859 (P<0.001). The MAM on fused images was 3.05\u00b11.35 mm (range, 1.1\u20136.7 mm). The quality of fused images was positively correlated with the CT values of focus (P=0.009). The complete ablation",

            "text": "Surgery is a major pillar for clinical management of cancer. About 80% of 15.2 million newlydiagnosed cancer patients in 2015 require surgery across the globe and by 2030 this figure will increase to 45 million [39]. Besides preventive, diagnostic, and cosmetic purposes, surgery contributes substantially to the cure of solid cancer at their infancy by removal of cancer tissue and lymph node. It has served as the only curative therapy for most solid tumours at an early stage, such as oesophagal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC), to mention only a few (Table 1). However, a majority of cancer cases were diagnosed at locally advanced or even metastatic stages, limiting the applicability of curative surgery. The development of oncological surgery mainly focuses on decreasing its invasiveness that, on a basis of equivalent anticancer efficacy, may help minimize perioperative complications and postoperative side-effects, and ultimately improve patients' quality of life. Laparoscopic surgery has shown equivalent anticancer efficacy and lower incidence or intensity of complications, compared with open surgery in gastric cancer and colorectal cancer [40,41]. However, critics indicate that high-quality evidence from well-designed randomized clinical trials with sound methods is needed to justify the routine implementation of laparoscopic gastrectomy [42]. Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery in pancreatic or periampullary cancer and cervical cancer was associated with an inferior oncologic outcome compared with open surgery [43][44][45][46]. Endoscopic surgery has been applied in early oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer in carefully selected patients in expert centres, such as T1a gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis [47][48][49][50]. Despite versatile flexibility of robotic surgery, its associated survival benefit and cost-effectiveness have been disputed, especially in mastectomy and other cancer-related surgeries Current major therapeutics for cancer. In the primary site, local treatments, including surgery, imaging-guided interventional procedure, and radiotherapy, can be applied with curative intent.",

            "text": "Tsurumaru et al. demonstrated the association between gastric cancer histopathologic types and the contrast enhancement pattern on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT images [25,26]. In our study, no association was observed between the double-layered enhancement pattern and CIN status. Consistent with our result, Lauren diffuse type gastric cancer (usually non-CIN subtype gastric cancer) frequently showed a double-layered pattern on arterial phase images and a single-layered pattern on delayed phase images [25]. \n\nThe novel concept of radiogenomics provides a connection between imaging traits and genetic information of cancers [13]. In the era of precision medicine, there is an increasing need to classify and treat cancers on a molecular basis because the clinical outcomes and treatment response may vary even if the cancers are histologically similar [27]. Although the advancement of high-throughput analysis has facilitated more rapid and lower cost genomics data acquirement [14], the inherent limitation is three-fold. First, genomic profiles require adequate tumor tissue, specialized equipment, and technical expertise. Second, surgical or image-guided tumor biopsy is not always feasible in cancer patients due to risks and possible complications associated with the biopsy procedure. Third and most importantly, a tumor may have different internal components with distinct gene expression patterns (i.e., intratumoral heterogeneity) [28]. Thus, tumor specimens only represent a small portion of the tumor rather than the whole tumor. Noninvasive imaging examinations, which are routinely performed for clinical staging, have the potential to provide overall perspectives of the tumor and demonstrate intratumoral heterogeneity. It will be helpful if we can correlate imaging traits (i.e., imaging phenotype or radiophenotype) to certain genetic subtypes or gene expression patterns of cancers [29]. Radiogenomic features have been demonstrated to be associated with the luminal B subtype of breast cancer [30] or the VHL gene mutation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma [31]. \n\nSerum biomarker is another potential approach to predict the CIN status of gastric cancer. CIN in plasma or serum cell-free DNA has been used to detect ovarian cancer or prostate cancer [32,33].",

            "text": "Female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. It is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women, followed by colorectal and lung cancer [1]. In 2020, breast cancer surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed malignancy, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases [1]. Over the past few decades, the management of breast cancer has progressed from radical treatment to targeted surgery with the use of more individualized therapeutic regimes [2]. In the era of precision medicine, early cancer diagnosis can allow for prompt medical intervention and effective treatment [3]. This will prevent the progression of disease from early to advanced stages. Consequently, this can help improve cancer prognosis and ultimately reduce overall mortality rates. \n\nVarious imaging modalities are utilized in investigating breast cancer, including ultrasound sonography (USS), mammography (MMG), MRI, and CT. With the increasing incidence of breast cancer diagnosed, imaging is at the forefront of guiding clinicians in the best approaches to managing breast malignancies. \n\nIn recent years, the rise of personalized medicine and the advancement of medical imaging analysis has encouraged the development of radiomics in the field of medicine. This exponential growth has enabled researchers to develop the field of radiomics through high-output computing. Radiomics is an emerging field of study in medical imaging that contains a broad set of computational methods. It uses data algorithms to extract quantitative features from radiographic images [4,5]. These extracted features, commonly known as radiomic features, can be utilized to guide diagnosis, treatment response, and prognosis in clinical settings. Radiomic analysis is built on the central hypothesis that tumor imaging reflects the underlying biological characteristics of the tumor, which may be presented as different radiomic values [5]. Previous studies have compared the performance of radiomics in several aspects of the diagnostic and staging process of many cancer pathologies, including breast cancer. This included differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions, predicting lymph node metastases from primary breast malignancies, identifying spinal metastases from lung primaries, predicting survival of patients with high-grade gliomas, and determining the invasiveness risk of stage 1 pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The exponential growth of radiomic research has led to its widespread integration into clinical practice.",

            "text": "Second, differences between voxel values of FDG PET/CT can be underestimated due to high cellular density of a voxel or the overall high glucose metabolism of tumor tissue. \n\nPseudotime analysis with radiomics data is a newly developed concept in the present study. Therefore, it is important to validate this concept in clinical aspects. First, an external validation is required. A multi-institutional study with more subjects could support the usefulness of pseudotime analysis for radiomics data. Second, a combined modeling for prognosis prediction is needed. Although pseudotime of radiomics data showed good prognostic discrimination in this study, it is not the only factor to determine prognosis. As clinical and pathological factors have been well known to reflect tumor biology, a prognostic model including clinicopathological factors as well as pseudotime from imaging data is expected to have excellent clinical significance. To conduct pseudotime analysis, a general computing system and basic statistical software, such as R, are needed. If there is a large scale of subjects or high-dimension dataset, an advanced computing system may be required. \n\nThis method can be also applied to radiomics data of other image modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For example, an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a value reflecting cell density based on the motion of water molecules [23]. Radiomics data based on ADC are known to have a correlation with the prognosis of cervical cancer and histological types of head and neck cancer [24,25]. Considering this previous knowledge, pseudotime analysis from an ADC map of an MRI can provide additional information in other cancer subtypes such as cervical cancer, or head and neck cancer. \n\nThis study has several limitations. First, only subjects undergoing neoadjuvant CCRT as an initial treatment were included in this study. As high-stage tumors usually demonstrate high FDG uptake, images of high-stage patients were expected to be useful in this preliminary study due to easy tumor recognition and delineation. Therefore, subjects with neoadjuvant CCRT were recruited for this project. As described earlier, a larger cohort is being collected for further study that will include patients with other treatment options such as surgery only or palliative chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Laryngeal cancer represents the second most common site of head and neck tumors [1,2], and has squamous cell carcinoma as the most important histology [2]. Accounting for approximately 160,000 new cases per year and for 2.5% of all tumors in males, LSCC remains a major disease burden worldwide. Treatment options comprise surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of modalities [3,4]. Despite refinement of multimodal therapies, the 5-year relative survival percentage has been stable at around 60 for the last decades for early laryngeal cancer [5]. \n\nDefinitive radiation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for early stage (T1-T2 N0) laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). However, 6-15% of patients with stage 1 disease and 20-31% of patients with stage 2 disease do not respond to radiotherapy [6]. If a patient fails radiotherapy, surgery is the main treatment option that may offer a cure, and up to 50% will require a total laryngectomy as salvage treatment. Moreover, when used as salvage surgery after a failed radiotherapy course, laryngectomy presents an increased complication rate [7]. Remarkably, for these failed cases, definitive cancer cure is delayed by the course of radiotherapy with a risk of tumor progression, adversely affecting patient prognosis still further. Unfortunately, we are unable to predict which tumors are likely to respond to radiation, and those, which will be resistant and persist. Therefore, it would be desirable to find novel and valuable markers to predict beforehand which patients will benefit from radiotherapy. \n\nRelevant clinical factors associated with local recurrence after radiotherapy are tumor size, tumor stage, overall treatment time and radiotherapy fraction size [8][9][10]. Treatment choice is now mainly based on T-stage [11], however, this is insufficient to warrant recurrencefree survival as observed in heterogeneous responses and survival rates presented by LSCC patients [6].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, other recommendations may be more difficult to define and thus more challenging to transmit. The achievement of negative surgical margins could reflect tumor location and other attributes, and does not reflect an a priori decision such as LN dissection or resection type. Furthermore, although radiation therapy for positive margins is generally recommended as a treatment option for cases with positive margins, it has not been validated in population analyses. 27 en after adjusting for surgical best practices, a modest but significant OS benefit persisted for stage 1 cases. The precise reasons for this observation are not clear. Stage 1 lung cancer represents a widely heterogeneous population, ranging from poorly differentiated, invasive cancers that likely have distant micrometastatic disease at diagnosis to incidentally detected, small, non-or minimally invasive tumors that might never impact patient quantity or quality of life even if left untreated. One possibility is that some clinical stage 2 cases derived OS benefit from removal of occult LN metastasis that was not present in clinical stage 1 cases, leading to increased effect of surgical quality measures. It is also possible that stage 1 cases at high-volume centers were more likely to represent particularly low-risk (based on size and/or histology) tumors. 9][30] Notably, sublobar resection was also performed more frequently at the lowest volume centers. We are unable to determine whether sublobar resections were performed (a) following guidance for the lowest risk tumors, (b) because the patient was not a candidate for lobectomy, or (c) because the treatment team was unaware of surgical best practices. \n\nOne previously proposed strategy to improve surgical outcomes is to limit who performs procedures. For NSCLC, it has been suggested that complex resections be performed only by individuals and facilities meeting minimal annual volume thresholds, specifically 20 per surgeon and 40 per facility. 31 The facility cut-off suggestion is consistent with our study finding that the highest quartile of facilities perform >34 annual NSCLC resections, a threshold comparable to that of high-volume centers in earlier studies. 4 Another recent analysis revealed that patients undergoing resection at top-ranked cancer centers have better postoperative outcomes compared to those receiving care at their affiliated centers. 32",

With respect to the composition of T0 group in our dataset (only 16 cases in total and 9 out of them were M1, which meant grouping by one dimension perhaps interrelated with others) and based on clinical experience, we analyzed the AJCC stage of cases. As the stage changed from I to IV, the risk of death significantly increased, ideally displaying the consistency between clinic prognosis and AJCC staging. In each AJCC stage group, the initial NPC subgroup exhibited a more favorable prognosis compared with the second NPC subgroup, indicating that primary site may be an independent risk factor beyond AJCC staging, and second primary malignancies might be a complex condition for current staging systems. \n\nProminent benefits were also noted for patients receiving standardized treatments compared with untreated. Any type of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that was appropriately performed significantly reduced mortality regardless of the primary site. Given that radiation therapy in localized head and neck cancers decreased the incidence of second head and neck cancer cancers, the reason for the better prognosis may be complicated (28). This finding indicates that once NPC is diagnosed, the patient should initiate available treatments as recommended as soon as possible. \n\nThe survival trends in SEER datasets in this study are generally consistent with the published literature, and statistical analysis of different aspects revealed compatible results. These results demonstrated that our findings were robust. Although SEER has collected information for cancer statistics on a large number of patients in the United States, NPC is still a rare tumor in this database considering the significant difference in prevalence among races and districts. Given that certain information is limited in SEER datasets, grouping criteria may not be definite and may require more deliberated discussion. For example, subgroups of the histological type \"non-squamous cell carcinoma\" and age could be stratified using a more detailed method, which may help adjust the accuracy of our conclusions.

            "text": "Breast cancer management is a multifaceted endeavor, relying on five primary treatment modalities: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy [191]. The customization of each patient's treatment plan hinges primarily on the disease stage and the molecular profile [192]. In this era of personalized medicine, intricate patient-specific details play a pivotal role. These encompass decisions regarding which treatment line is most suitable, the timing of interventions, and the sequence of these therapeutic approaches. The administration of these treatment modalities within specialized, high-volume breast cancer centers, guided by multidisciplinary team assessments, is no longer an extravagance but a determinant of patients' oncological outcomes and their overall quality of life [192]. Surgery encompasses both breast and axillary procedures. Within breast surgery, there are two primary categories: breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy, the latter of which may or may not involve reconstruction. Breast-conserving surgery represents the gold standard for early-stage breast cancer [193]. Mastectomy, on the other hand, remains a vital alternative for those ineligible for breast conservation, such as the patients with locally advanced tumors at the time of surgery, patients unsuitable for breast irradiation, individuals with multicentric tumors that cannot be sufficiently removed through oncological resection, and those who opt against breast conservation [192][193][194][195][196]. For patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction surgeries, whether involving synthetic or autologous implants, offer crucial options [197][198][199]. Axillary surgery encompasses procedures such as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). SNB has become the standard approach for node-negative breast cancer and selected cases of node-positive breast cancer. However, axillary dissection remains necessary for patients with multiple metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of surgery, as well as for individuals who are not suitable candidates or have experienced failed sentinel lymph node localization [160,[200][201][202][203].",

            "text": "Female breast cancer has recently surpassed lung cancer to become the most common cancer worldwide (1). Increasingly young patients develop breast cancer, among which axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is the most common mode of metastasis. Axillary lymph nodes (ALN) reside in the axillary region of the upper limb and carry important information for the anatomic staging of breast cancer. The presence and extent of axillary lymph node metastasis reflect the risk of distant recurrence and death after topical treatment. Moreover, the overall survival rate of nodepositive patients is 40% lower than node-negative (2,3). Thus, the lymph node status is crucial for treatment planning, surgical procedures, and prognosis assessment of patients (4).Currently, staging of the axilla in patients with breast cancer is evaluated with sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection. However, both involve invasive surgery and have a high incidence of complications (5-7). Therefore, developing noninvasive ALN staging methods for determining the clinical stage of breast cancer and selecting individualized treatment options for patients is paramount.\n\nRadiomics is a novel noninvasive method that rapidly extracts numerous quantitative features imperceptible to the naked eye from traditional biomedical images through high-throughput computation. It provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information by analyzing the correlation between image features and clinical data, which is widely used in tumor grading, therapeutic response, and prognostic assessment (8,9).In breast cancer, radiomics constructs predictive models for ALNM and SLNM by extracting quantitative features from ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray mammography (MMG), or positron emission tomography (PET), with good potential (10-14). However, due to differences in study methods and imaging modalities, heterogeneity may arise among the studies. Moreover, in patients with breast cancer, systematic research on the performance of radiomics in predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) and the factors affecting it is lacking, necessitating further verification of radiomics for clinical",

            "text": "Furthermore, pT and pN stage were meaningful and positively connected with tumor grade when it comes to model construction. It is worth noting that since this is a retrospective study, the stage here relates to the postoperative pathological information, but it is difficult for us to obtain totally precise staging information prior to surgery, predicting histologic grade using radiomic features may be more effective and successful. \n\nTexture features are generally recognized as quantitative indicators of tumor heterogeneity because they are strongly related to the tumor microenvironment [40]. Our model-CP-IMD and model-Combine screened texture features mainly from wavelet and LoG filtered transformed images, with iodine-based MD images providing most of them. The findings showed that the features extracted from the iodine-based preprocessed images were more stable than those acquired from the original images. Our findings emphasize the value of using iodine-based MD images to extract high-order statistical features to assist in the radiological assessment and clinical decision-making. \n\nThere were certain limitations in our research. First, because this was a single-center retrospective study, selection bias was unavoidable. Second, the model was based on small sample size and there was no external validation. To evaluate the usefulness and robustness of this CP-IMD combined model, further research based on more patients and multiple centers is required. Third, only the venous phase images were employed to derive the radiomics features in this work. This was due to the fact that tumor differentiation from neighboring normal stomach tissue was at its peak in the portal venous phase, and additional phases should be investigated in the future. \n\nIn conclusion, our findings showed that DESCT-based radiomics models could help preoperatively predict histologic grade. The DESCT iodine-based MD images derived radiomic signatures have great potential for enhancing diagnostic performance. To fully comprehend the predictive potential of radiomics in this context, larger prospective studies are required. \n\n\u2022 fast, convenient online submission \u2022 thorough peer review by experienced researchers in your field \u2022 rapid publication on acceptance \n\n\u2022 support for research data, including large and complex data types \u2022 gold Open Access which fosters wider collaboration and increased citations maximum visibility for your research: over 100M website views per year",

Despite the introduction of new imaging techniques and the refinement of existing techniques, it remains difficult to stage accurately in the preoperative period between organ confined and locally advanced diseases. Ohori, et al. reported that the PPV and NPV for detecting ECE were 74% and 64%, respectively, for DRE, and in another study, the PPV and NPV of MRI for identifying ECE ranged from 66% to 82% and from 30% to 90%, respectively. 25,26 he wide variation in the reliability of DRE and MRI for determining the presence of ECE may come from the operator-dependent examinations, which depend on the personal skill and the interpretation of the test results by the investigator. Although standard clinical staging evaluation does not considers MRI but DRE, clinical assessment by DRE and the measurement of the PSA level is not accurate in determining the local stage, with underestimations in as many as 40-60% of cases. 27 The sensitivity of DRE alone in diagnosing non organ-confined diseases is poor: 20-40% of men with nonpalpable diseases and 50-75% of men with palpable clinical stage T2 tumors have extraprostatic diseases at surgery and over-staging occurs in 10-20% of men with clinically non organ-confined diseases. 28 Therefore, accurate staging with additional imaging methods is an important issue for correct management of prostate cancer patients.",

            "text": "According to global cancer statistics in 2020, rectal cancer (RC) is a major threat to humans. The RC has the third-highest recorded incidence of cancer, which is listed after lung cancer and breast cancer, and the cancer-related mortality rate of RC is ranked second after lung cancer [1]. Early detection and diagnosis is crucial to effectively treat RC. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), which means RC with stage T3 or T4 [2]. The standard treatment option for LARC is neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) [3,4]. However, even though patients with LARC have already received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the 5-year overall survival rate is only 66.3% [5]. \n\nThe poor prognosis of RC is related to various factors, including lesion size, stage, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status, tumor marker status, immune indicators that are positive, RC's sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and so on [6]. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that vascular invasion is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of RC [7,8]. Now, the LVI status can be obtained by only postoperative pathology, which therefore cannot guide whether the patient should be treated more aggressively preoperatively. Therefore, preoperative prediction of LVI in RC is helpful for clinical decision-making. \n\nThere are numerous means of preoperative examination for RC. Colonoscopy can observe the general surface of the mass and perform the biopsy; however, the disadvantage is that the depth of infiltration and extraintestinal invasion could not be observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially high-resolution MRI, is the first choice for preoperative imaging diagnosis and postoperative follow-up review, which can accurately perform tumor node matastasis (TNM) staging, but its high cost makes it difficult to repeat multiple examinations, and it is always difficult to distinguish the T2 stage from the T3 stage [9,10].",

            "text": "Interestingly, the best duration of DC was achieved with PR or even CR in 56.6% of patients. Such rates of PR or CR cannot be achieved by any systemic option, including mitotane alone, currently. \n\nWe looked for prognostic factors for DC with LR treatments in this homogenous population of metastatic ACC patients and identified two simple radiological parameters: five metastases at most or a maximum diameter below 3 cm are associated with higher rates of DC (HR: 6.15 and HR: 3.78, respectively). These results confirm the results of previous reports obtained in ACC populations and in other cancers, showing the importance of the maximum diameter of each metastasis and the number of metastases as a prognostic factor of response to several interventional radiology techniques. Surgery may be the ideal tool in cases of large but limited-number metastases. In case of an infiltrative lesion or a location at risk, radiotherapy could be the technique of choice. Overall, a combination of such techniques can be proposed and repeated over a patient's treatment course (Figure 4). These results stress the importance of early minimally invasive interventions to expect the best response with a low complication rate, as previously reported by Cazejuste et al. [17] in 2010 and Velti et al. [23]. Interestingly, DC, including stabilization, was found to be independently associated with longer TTC and OS, suggesting that this endpoint could be a surrogate marker in future studies [24][25][26]. Overall, all stage IVa ACC patients for which either SD, PR, or CR is achievable through the combination and repetition of LR should be considered for the LR strategy. \n\nThere is a common effort among all oncologic specialties to provide specific definitions of oligometastatic disease for each cancer type. Hellman et al. [27] first defined oligometastatic cancer as \"an intermediate stage between localized and systemic disease, where radical treatment of the primary cancer and of metastatic lesions might yield improved systemic control\". Since then, a more dynamic approach has been proposed on the basis of metachronous or synchronous evolution and response to treatment.",

Overall in a study conducted by R\u00f6sch [40] , EUS was able to correctly stage esophageal cancer 84% of the time, and the In the classification system of metastasis set forth by the AJCC, distant metastasis can be subdivided into M1a and M1b. Each of these classifications is crucial in determining possible treatment options. M1a includes metastasis to celiac and cervical lymph node groups. This classification is associated with a better prognosis compared to M1b. Patients classified as M1a often times complete a course of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. Patients with M1b include those with distant site metastasis. This classification usually carries a worse prognosis given that surgical resection with curative intent is not indicated in these cases [46] . \n\nCT is the most commonly used imaging modality to rule out distant metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer. The most common areas of distant metastasis can be quickly assessed using contrast-enhanced CT. Sensitivity for spiral CT to detect masses \u2265 1 cm has been reported as high as 90% [47] . \n\nEUS is limited in its ability to assess for distant metastasis. In general, CT or FDG-PET is preferred over endoscopic United States for M staging of esophageal cancer. \n\nFDG PET most distinct role in esophageal cancer staging is in the detection of distant metastasis. In comparison to CT, PET has been shown to be more accurate in detecting distant metastasis [48] . One study showed that PET was able to detect distant metastasis 15% of the time in patients that were believed to only have primary esophageal cancer by other imaging modalities [49] . If present, distant metastasis places the patient in M1b category and surgery with curative intent is no longer recommended. Accurate M staging is imperative in guiding treatment options.",

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is one of the three major types of malignant tumor and is common in the female reproductive system. Approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed once the tumor has metastasized to the abdominal cavity outside of the reproductive organs, which represents International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (2) III or IV disease, for which the respective 5-year overall survival (OS) rates are only ~31 and 13% (3,4). The mortality rate of malignant ovarian tumors is the highest among the gynecological malignant tumors, and has become a serious threat to the lives and health of women with primary tumors. Surgery is prioritized in order to cure ovarian cancer, and is supplemented by being combined with post-surgical chemotherapy. Tumor cells are successfully removed in ~45% of patients, and this is dependent on the tumor size and location, and the individual experience of the surgeons (5). The main cause of recurrent ovarian cancer remains unclear. Various types of consolidation therapy have been studied in a series of clinical trials, but none have been demonstrated to improve survival time in ovarian cancer (5)(6)(7). \n\nSeveral studies (8,9) have introduced positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Du et al (8) demonstrated that use of fludeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG)-PET/CT for ovarian cancer recurrence of retroperitoneal lymph nodes to design the IMRT plan can improve the accuracy of the gross tumor volume (GTV) sketch and improve the clinical therapeutic effect. Huang et al (9) reported the case of a 68-year-old female with ovarian cancer and a large abdominal metastasis (FIGO stage III), who did not undergo surgery, but received PET/CT imaging orientation-guided IMRT. The patient did not experience any significant acute or chronic radiation response.",

            "text": "Among various cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 90% of cervical cancer cases and develops from the squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix. Staging information is crucial for clinicians to create individualized treatment plans that address the specific characteristics of the disease while minimizing the risks of overtreatment or undertreatment. The FIGO classification system is universally adopted for defining the stages of cervical cancer [7]. Several variables were analyzed in our study to identify risk factors affecting survival time, age, equivalent doses administered, FIGO stage, tumor grading, and treatment type. Data on other potential risk factors, such as the age at the first pregnancy, sexual partner's number, smoking status, Pap smear test history, and tumor histopathology, were not available. Consequently, the accessible variables were used to assess their impact on survival time. The sensitivity of cervical cancer to chemotherapy was demonstrated in 1983 concluding that combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy significantly improves the cervical cancer prognosis, reducing the risk of local or distant relapse as compared to radiotherapy alone. \n\nFor early-stage cervical cancer, where the malignancy is confined to the cervix, treatment options typically include radical surgery or radical radiotherapy. Radical surgery involves the removal of the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and potentially other surrounding tissues. Alternatively, radical radiotherapy uses highenergy X-rays to target and destroy cancer cells. Clinical studies have shown that both radical surgery and radiotherapy are equally effective for early-stage cervical cancer. In cases where the tumor is larger or has spread to adjacent tissues (locally advanced disease), the standard treatment approach often includes chemoradiation, which combines radiotherapy with chemotherapy to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Since 1999, the use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been recommended for patients with LACC. Currently, chemotherapy, particularly NACT, is widely utilized in clinical practices for the treatment of cervical cancer [17][18][19]. The precision of radiation delivery and minimum exposure to surrounding tissues at risk determine the effectiveness of treatment response and further strategies to be employed.",

            "text": "Therefore, clinical workers should pay more attention to the important role of genetic instability in the occurrence and development of MPMTs.Testing for MSI in the first primary cancer may help to identify patients at high risk of developing MPMTs.Furthermore, some tumors have a high risk for developing MPMTs; for example, 6%-8% of patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and 10%-20% of patients with GIST developed MPMTs [17].Thus, patients with GIST and STS should be monitored closely due to their increased susceptibility.However, in this study, we found that all of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, with the exception of one neuroendocrine carcinoma and one GIST.Therefore, the relationship between STS, GIST, and gastrointestinal MPMTs needs further study.\n\nThe therapeutic principle for MPMTs depends on the location and stage of each tumor, pathological tumor types, and physical condition of the patient.Treatment options for patients with MPMTs should be determined by multi-disciplinary teams of experts from oncology surgery, oncology medicine, radiotherapy, pathology, endoscopy, and other departments.The economic capability and willingness of patients may also influence both treatment plans and outcomes.Our study found that surgery combined with chemotherapy was the dominant treatment strategy for both the first and second primary cancers.This result was also consistent with the treatment strategies for gastrointestinal malignant tumors.The resection rate of the second primary cancer was lower than that of the first primary cancer.A possible reason for this is the high proportion of stage IV second primary cancers caused by failed timely reviews following diagnosis of the first primary cancer.In addition, some patients were unwilling to undergo surgical treatment.\n\nIn this study, the MMPMT group showed a longer survival time from diagnosis of the first primary cancer than the SMPMT group.However, the survival rate from diagnosis of the second primary cancer among the two groups showed no difference.This suggests that the second primary cancer may be the main factor affecting the survival time of patients with MMPMTs.",

We present the case of a 46-year-old female referred to our hospital with a preoperative diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule. On initial approach, a biopsy revealed a small cell lung cancer.

            "text": "In radiation therapy the integral dose is increasing steadily with the introduction of more imaging procedures to the treatment process [1]. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) makes use of many different imaging techniques, using modalities as portal imaging, fluoroscopy and CT in many variations (fan-beam, cone-beam, MV, kV). Clinically applied regimens are as simple as a single setup image or as complex as intrafraction tumor tracking. The total imaging radiation dose experienced by a patient can include multiple CT scans for planning, pretreatment fluoroscopic studies to analyze tumor motion, and a series of interfraction and intrafraction images for target localization. \n\nThe quantification of the additional imaging dose in terms of second cancer risk for the patient is not an easy task. The report of the AAPM task group 75 [1] on the management of imaging dose during imageguided radiotherapy recommends to use the concept of effective dose to determine the stochastic risk for the patient. It is fundamentally important to compare the imaging dose to the total dose delivered by the treatment beams themself. The AAPM task group 75 [1] discourages from naively equating imaging dose with treatment beam, scatter, and leakage dose, since the comparison process is more complicated. As the doseresponse curve for radiation induced cancer might be different at therapeutic dose levels when compared to imaging doses, it is also not recommended to use effective dose to quantify therapy dose in order to compare it to the effective dose from imaging. Therefore the task group 75 [1] considers that it is not yet practical to quantitatively combine the evaluation of total imaging dose with the evaluation of total therapeutic dose. However, to manage imaging dose in the spirit of the ALARA convention it is necessary to establish a quantitative comparison between imaging and therapeutic dose. \n\nThe aim of this report is the development of a concept which allows a comparison of imaging dose with commonly accepted variations of the treatment beam, scatter, and leakage dose. It is assumed that the dose variations of the treatment beam which are accepted by the radiation oncologist and/or medical physicist in the spirit of the ALARA convention can also be applied to the additional imaging dose.",

An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease [44]. OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction [45,46] (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness.",

            "text": "The establishment of a nationwide mammography breast-screening program for women aged 50 -74 years has resulted in an increasing proportion of early breast cancers in the Netherlands during the 1990s (Nab et al, 1993;van Dijck et al, 2000). Over the last decade breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has become the standard treatment for early stage breast cancer, as firm data have shown that the outcome of BCS is comparable to the outcome after modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in terms of disease-specific survival (Veronesi et al, 1981;Fisher et al, 1985;EBCTG, 1995). Most breast cancer treatment guidelines state that the expected cosmetic outcome and patient preferences should guide the decision to perform BCS. Several studies, however, have indicated that surgical treatment for breast cancer may vary with the region or the hospital in which a patient is treated (Farrow et al, 1992;Nattinger et al, 1992;Voogd et al, 1994;Sainsbury et al, 1995;Scorpiglione et al, 1995;Bland et al, 1998;Guadagnoli et al, 1998b;Morrow et al, 2001). Although a large evidence base has been accumulated defining the most effective treatment strategies for early stage breast cancer, considerable treatment variability remains both between and within countries (Malin et al, 2002). Receiving less than appropriate care has been associated with an increased risk of recurrence and lower breast cancer-specific survival (Lash et al, 2000). Regular performance measurements, using standardised clinical indicators, can play an important role in monitoring the patterns of care with regard to cancer treatment (Schneider et al, 2004).\n\nThis population-based study presents an overview of treatment patterns for early stage breast cancer in the Netherlands over the period 1989 -2002. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variation in primary surgical treatment and the compliance with guidelines, with respect to the application of radiotherapy and axillary lymph node dissection, with emphasis on the effect of the sentinel node biopsy (SNB) introduction.",

            "text": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Abstract To achieve a deeper understanding of patients who developed esophageal cancer (EC) as a second primary malignancy, which may help guide in clinical practice for these patients in the future. In the primary cohort, EC patients with a prior malignancy were identified from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end result 18 database. The 5 most common types of prior cancers were picked out based on the frequency of occurrence. In addition, Kaplan\u2013Meier and log-rank tests were performed to investigate the survival impacts of prior cancers on EC patients. Besides, a competing-risk model was constructed to explore the relationship between EC-treatment and EC-specific mortality. In the secondary cohort, patients with stage I\u2013III (N0M0) EC from 2004 to 2014 were enrolled. After propensity score matching, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were developed to determine the prognostic factors for EC patients. A total of 1199 EC patients with a prior cancer were identified in the primary cohort. The 5 most common sites of prior cancers were prostate, female breast, bladder, lung and bronchus, and larynx. Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses revealed that EC patients with prior prostate cancer and bladder cancer had the best overall survival (OS), while those with prior cancers of larynx and lung and bronchus had the worst OS. Fine and Gray competing risks analysis indicated that the administration of surgery was closely associated with better EC-specific survival (P\u200a<\u200a.001). In the secondary cohort, multivariate Cox analyses found that age at diagnosis, race, tumor grade, tumor extent, nodal status and metastasis stage, histology, and the administration of surgery were prognostic factors for OS and cancer-specific survival in EC patients. Besides, the existence of a prior cancer was an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival. EC remains to be the most important cause of death in EC patients with a prior cancer. EC related treatment should be actively adopted in patients with a prior cancer, as they were more likely to die from EC than the prior cancer. EC patients with a prior cancer had comparable OS than those without.",

Its application to lung neoplasm was first introduced in 2001 and has been implemented to treat metastatic disease to the lung or in select medically inoperable patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC. IGTA may also be an alternative to treat stage I NSCLC in non-operable patients with interstitial lung disease in whom a radiation modality is deemed too high risk. There are 3 methods of delivery: radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation and cryoablation. Observational series and some prospective trials have shown safety and efficacy across all three modalities. Despite accumulating experience, there are no large randomized clinical trials comparing the outcomes of lung IGTA to alternative locoregional therapies (e.g. stereotactic body radiotherapy or sublobar pulmonary resection) for the treatment of stage I NSCLC. Because IGTA is a local therapy, a higher risk of locoregional recurrence is inherently understood as compared with anatomic resection. In the literature, primary tumor control after RFA ranges from 47-90% and is dependent on tumor size and proximity to bronchovascular structures. Local failure ranges from 10-47%, and tumors \u2265 3 cm have the highest rate of local recurrence. The most prevalent side effects are pneumothorax and reactive pleural effusion; hemorrhage is uncommon. Of note, observational series show no significant loss of lung function after IGTA.

            "abstract": "\n Background pCR rates in stage II \u2013 III HER2-positive breast cancer have greatly improved since the addition of HER2 targeted agents to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are associated with excellent long-term survival. While longer treatment regimens increase pCR rate, early complete responses are also common. We evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on the identification of early complete responders.\n Methods 45 hospitals across the Netherlands participated in the phase 2 TRAIN-3 trial. Patients received neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz). Response to treatment was monitored every three cycles and patients were referred for surgery in case of a radiologic complete response (rCR) or after a maximum of 9 cycles. RCR was defined as the absence of pathological enhancement on MRI breast plus negative vacuum assisted core biopsies in case of hormone-receptor positive (HR+) tumors. In addition, negative fine needle aspiration or lymph node biopsy was required in patients with nodal involvement at baseline. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Here, we report locally assessed rCR and pCR rates after 3, 6 and 9 cycles, the negative predictive value of rCR assessment and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Analyses are stratified by HR-status.\n Results We included 467 patients between April 2019 and May 2021. Median age was 51 years, 69% had stage II disease and 232 had HR+ tumors. 33.6% of HR- patients and 15.5% of HR+ patients achieved pCR after 3 cycles of PTC-Ptz (see table). The NPV was higher in HR- patients and independent of the number of cycles. AE evaluation is currently ongoing.\n Conclusion Three cycles of PTC-Ptz induce an early pCR in one in three HR- and one in six HR+ tumors in patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI-based response evaluation identifies these patients with \u00b187% certainty in HR- disease and \u00b158% in HR+ disease. Continuation of PTC-Ptz after 6 cycles further improves pCR rates and can be considered to reduce the need for adjuvant T-DM1. Efficacy and safety of this image-guided approach to tailor treatment duration need to be confirmed with follow-up in EFS and OS analyses.\n Table 1: Cumulative rCR & pCR according to HR-status *Including patients who underwent surgery for other reasons than rCR\n Citation Format: Anna van der Voort, Mette S. van Ramshorst, Rob Kessels, Ingrid A.

            "text": "\n Background pCR rates in stage II \u2013 III HER2-positive breast cancer have greatly improved since the addition of HER2 targeted agents to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are associated with excellent long-term survival. While longer treatment regimens increase pCR rate, early complete responses are also common. We evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on the identification of early complete responders.\n Methods 45 hospitals across the Netherlands participated in the phase 2 TRAIN-3 trial. Patients received neoadjuvant systemic treatment consisting of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz). Response to treatment was monitored every three cycles and patients were referred for surgery in case of a radiologic complete response (rCR) or after a maximum of 9 cycles. RCR was defined as the absence of pathological enhancement on MRI breast plus negative vacuum assisted core biopsies in case of hormone-receptor positive (HR+) tumors. In addition, negative fine needle aspiration or lymph node biopsy was required in patients with nodal involvement at baseline. The primary endpoint was 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Here, we report locally assessed rCR and pCR rates after 3, 6 and 9 cycles, the negative predictive value of rCR assessment and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Analyses are stratified by HR-status.\n Results We included 467 patients between April 2019 and May 2021. Median age was 51 years, 69% had stage II disease and 232 had HR+ tumors. 33.6% of HR- patients and 15.5% of HR+ patients achieved pCR after 3 cycles of PTC-Ptz (see table). The NPV was higher in HR- patients and independent of the number of cycles. AE evaluation is currently ongoing.\n Conclusion Three cycles of PTC-Ptz induce an early pCR in one in three HR- and one in six HR+ tumors in patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI-based response evaluation identifies these patients with \u00b187% certainty in HR- disease and \u00b158% in HR+ disease. Continuation of PTC-Ptz after 6 cycles further improves pCR rates and can be considered to reduce the need for adjuvant T-DM1. Efficacy and safety of this image-guided approach to tailor treatment duration need to be confirmed with follow-up in EFS and OS analyses.\n Table 1: Cumulative rCR & pCR according to HR-status *Including patients who underwent surgery for other reasons than rCR\n Citation Format: Anna van der Voort, Mette S. van Ramshorst, Rob Kessels, Ingrid A.

            "abstract": "\n Background Neo-adjuvant treatment with 6-9 cycles anti-HER2 based chemotherapy leads to excellent long-term survival in patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer, but comes with important side effects. The TRAIN-3 study previously showed that one in three patients with hormone receptor negative (HR-) tumors and one in six with hormone receptor positive (HR+) tumors have an early pathologic complete response (pCR) after only three cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we present the results of the primary endpoint, 3-year event-free survival (EFS). Methods TRAIN-3 is a single-arm, phase 2 study in 43 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with stage II\u2013III HER2-positive breast cancer received up to nine cycles of neoadjuvant systemic therapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin and pertuzumab (PTC-Ptz) and were referred for surgery once a complete radiologic response was seen on MRI. Locoregional and endocrine treatment followed national guidelines. Patients with a pCR completed one year of trastuzumab and pertuzumab as adjuvant treatment. Patients with residual invasive disease completed the 9 cycles of PTC-Ptz followed by 14 cycles of T-DM1. EFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier statistics on an intention-to-treat basis for each HR subgroup separately. Three-year EFS rates of 88% for HR- and 90% for HR+ tumors were taken as reference. The study would be declared successful if no more than 38 events in the HR- subgroup and 34 events in the HR+ subgroup occurred after 700 patient years of follow-up. Results 235 patients with HR- tumors received 1-3 (n=91, 38.7%), 4-6 (n=76, 32.3%) or 7-9 (n=68, 28.9%) cycles of PTC-Ptz. 232 patients with HR+ tumors received 1-3 (n=69, 29.7%), 4-6 (n=71, 30.6%) or 7-9 (n=92, 39.7%) cycles of PTC-Ptz. After a median follow-up of 39.7 months (IQR 34.8-45.4), 3-year EFS was 92.1% (95% CI 88.5-95.8) in the HR- subgroup and 92.0% (95% CI 88.5-95.6) in the HR+ subgroup. A total of 19 and 21 events were reported in patients with HR- and HR+ tumors respectively, meeting the primary endpoint. Events included 9 vs 8 distant recurrences, 7 vs 6 locoregional recurrences, 2 vs 4 non-breast second primary malignancies, 0 vs 3 second primary breast tumors, and 1 vs 0 non-breast cancer related death, in HR- and HR+ patients respectively. EFS rates in patients treated with 1-3 cycles of neoadjuvant systemic therapy were 96.0% (95% CI 91.6-100) in HR- and 97.1% (95% CI 93.3-100) in HR+ patients. Corresponding figures were 90.8% (95% CI 84.5-97.5) and 92.8% (95% CI 87.0-99.1) in patients treated with 4-6 cycles and 87.6% (95% CI 79.1-97.0) and 87.1% (80.3-94.6) in patients treated with 7-9 cycles. Conclusions In patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer, MRI-guided treatment optimization is associated with excellent 3-year EFS. These results confirm our earlier findings on pCR rate that one in three patients with HR- disease and one in six patients with HR+ disease can be treated effectively with only three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This approach offers a novel therapeutic option that provides a significant reduction in toxicity for this patient population.\n Citation Format: Fleur Louis, Anna van der Voort, Mette van Ramshorst, Antonios Daletzakis, Ingrid Mandjes, Inge Kemper, Mariette Agterof, Wim van der Steeg, Joan Heijns, Marlies van Bekkum, Ester Siemerink, Philomeen Kuijer, Astrid Scholten, Jelle Wesseling, Marie-Jeanne Vrancken Peeters, Ritse Mann, Gabe Sonke.

The current objective was to evaluate treatment options and important factors to consider during treatment selection for these high-risk patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe AATS Clinical Practice Standards Committee assembled an expert panel to review treatment options for high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. After a systematic search of the literature identification of lung-nodule-related factors to consider in treatment selection, the panel developed expert consensus statements and vignettes using a modified Delphi method. A 75% consensus was required for approval.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expert panel identified sublobar resection, image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA), and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), which is also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), as modalities applicable in the treatment of high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC. Fourteen statements and 5 vignettes illustrating clinical scenarios were formulated, revised, and ultimately approved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe choice of which modality (sublobar resection, SABR, or IGTA) is optimal in high-risk patients with stage I NSCLC is complex, but a surgical approach is generally favored when deemed safe. SABR and IGTA are reasonable options in select patients, with SABR being the likely next choice in nonsurgical patients.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detecting hepatic micrometastases from melanoma at a very early stage and in aiding tumor resection by intraoperative guidance. Methods: In vivo studies were performed by following protocols approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research at Xiamen University. First, a mouse model of B16 melanoma metastatic to the liver (n = 10) was established to study the development of micrometastases in vivo. Next, the mice were imaged by a scalable PAI instrument, ultrasound, 9.4-T high-resolution MRI, PET/CT, and bioluminescence imaging. PAI scans acquired with optical wavelengths of 680\u2013850 nm were kept spectrally unmixed by using a linear least-squares method to differentiate various components. Differences in signal-to-background ratios among different modalities were determined with the 2-tailed paired t test. The diagnostic results were assessed with histologic examination. Excised liver samples from patients diagnosed with hepatic cancer were also examined to identify the tumor boundaries. Surgical removal of metastatic melanoma was precisely guided in vivo by the portable PAI system. Results: PAI was able to detect metastases as small as approximately 400 \u03bcm at a depth of up to 7 mm in vivo\u2014a size that is smaller than can be detected with ultrasound and MRI. The tumor-to-liver ratio for PAI at 8 d (4.2 \u00b1 0.2, n = 6) and 14 d (9.2 \u00b1 0.4, n = 5) was significantly higher than for PET/CT (1.8 \u00b1 0.1, n = 5, and 4.5 \u00b1 0.2, n = 5, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Functional PAI revealed dynamic oxygen saturation changes during tumor growth. The limit of detection was approximately 219 cells/\u03bcL in vitro. We successfully performed intraoperative PAI-guided surgery in vivo using the portable PAI system. Conclusion: Our findings offer a rapid and effective complementary clinical imaging application to noninvasively detect micrometastases and guide intraoperative resection.",

Advantages in survival and quality of life (QoL) have led to a higher demand for BCS. Success of BCS is characterized by negative margins and a good cosmetic outcome. The aims of this cohort study were to determine whether wire-guided localization (WGL) combined with multidetector CT (MDCT) guided 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction could guide precision breast conserving surgery (PBCS), and to access the cosmetic outcome reported by patients. Methods: 31 patients with unifocal breast cancer were enrolled for PBCS guided by WGL combined with MDCT guided 3D reconstruction from 2021 to 2022. Under local anesthesia, surrounded WGL was performed, followed by an immediate contrast enhanced MDCT scan. One day after the localization, PBCS guided by MDCT guided 3D reconstruction was performed. 61 women who underwent palpation guided breast conserving surgery (BCS) were included as control. Two-sided Student t test, Fisher\u2019s exact test and chi-square test was applied. Results: Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) cosmetic subscale was used to access patient reported cosmetic outcomes in our study. In the PBCS group, the results indicated no significant changes (P=0.168) between the baseline assessment and 1 month post operation.

Methods & Materials: Eligible patients for this single institution phase II trial (IRB 18-002) were aged 50 or older with unifocal stage 0 to 1 breast cancer measuring \u2264 3 cm undergoing breast conserving surgery or oncoplastic reconstruction with negative surgical margins (\u2265 2 mm margin width), ER positive, negative nodes and no lymphovascular invasion. Presurgical MRI was routinely performed. Patients were treated to 30 Gy in 5 fractions via intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using a QOD schedule on the Varian Edge radiosurgery system. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the tumor cavity + 1.5 cm cropped 5 mm off skin with the mean PTV30 of 146 cc (range 43-408). Clinical follow-up included history and physical, breast imaging, and the validated Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS) at 6 to 12 months intervals. Results: A total of 50 patients with 52 tumors were enrolled with a median age of 76 (range 51 to 89) between November 2018 and July 2022 with 23 patients (46%) undergoing oncoplastic breast surgery. Median follow-up was 37 months (range 9 to 64), the 4-year local control, regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 100%, 96%, 100%, and 94% respectively. There were 2 recurrences (1 regional nodal failure, 1 second primary triple negative breast cancer) and 3 deaths from other causes other than breast cancer occurred in this patient population. Treatment was well tolerated with 22% grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity and 4% late toxicity consisting of grade 1 pain. Physician-rated long-term cosmesis was rated as 83% excellent and 17% good. BCTOS scores at baseline were 58% excellent (91% lumpectomy, 13% oncoplastic), 42% good (9% lumpectomy, 88% oncoplastic), 0% fair to poor, and at \u22652 year follow up were 92% excellent, (100 % lumpectomy, 86% oncoplastic), 8% good (0 % lumpectomy, 14% oncoplastic), and 0% fair to poor. Conclusion: This trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a modernized Florence regimen in low-risk stage 0 to 1 breast cancer patients treated at a community hospital.

In this comprehensive review we discuss management recommendations for the treatment of mucinous ovarian cancer. Although most tumors are stage I at diagnosis, 15\u201320% are advanced stage at diagnosis. Traditionally, patients with primary mucinous ovarian cancer have been treated similarly to those with the more common serous ovarian cancer. However, recent studies have shown that mucinous ovarian cancer is very different from other types of epithelial ovarian cancer. Primary mucinous ovarian cancer is less likely to spread to lymph nodes or the upper abdomen and more likely to affect younger women, who may desire fertility-sparing therapies. Surgical management of mucinous ovarian cancer mirrors surgical management of other types of epithelial ovarian cancer and includes a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and total hysterectomy. When staging is indicated, it should include pelvic washing, omentectomy, and peritoneal biopsies; lymph node evaluation should be considered in patients with infiltrative tumors. The appendix should be routinely evaluated intra-operatively, but an appendectomy may be omitted if the appendix appears grossly normal. Fertility preservation can be considered in patients with gross disease confined to one ovary and a normal-appearing contralateral ovary. Patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease whose disease distribution suggests a high likelihood of complete gross resection may be candidates for secondary debulking. Primary mucinous ovarian cancer seems to be resistant to standard platinum-and-taxane regimens used frequently for other types of ovarian cancer. Gastrointestinal cancer regimens are another option; these include 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, or capecitabine and oxaliplatin. Data on heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for mucinous ovarian cancer are scarce, but HIPEC may be worth considering. For patients with recurrence or progression on first-line chemotherapy, we advocate enrollment in a clinical trial if one is available. For this reason, it may be beneficial to perform molecular testing in all patients with recurrent or progressive mucinous ovarian cancer.",

As a result, the treatment strategies for advanced or recurrent breast cancer have changed significantly. The combination of CDK 4/6 inhibitors administration and endocrine therapy is now widely used in the treatment of HR+ HER2\u2212 recurrent breast cancer with improved outcomes. In 2021, abemaciclib was approved as post-operative adjuvant combination therapy with endocrine therapy for HR+ HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer and is expected to suppress postoperative recurrence. A range of new agents are being developed in addition to CDK4/6 inhibitors that provided more options of treatment strategies for advanced or recurrent breast cancer, which in turn could improve outcomes. However, the prognosis for the recurrent HR+ HER2\u2212 breast cancer remains poor, overall survival (OS) is still very low and a complete cure is difficult even with the treatments. Case Description In 1998, 24 years ago, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and the concept of subtypes were not even widespread, the number of available drugs was far fewer than today, the clinical treatment guidelines had not been established. Nevertheless, we experienced a case of HR+ HER2\u2212 advanced breast cancer, stage IIIB at the initial diagnosis, which was consistently treated with the aim of complete cure and with the various treatments available at the time, resulting in long-term survival. 24 years have passed since the initial surgery, the patient has continued to do well despite repeated recurrences and remissions. Conclusions We report here a case of long-term survival in advanced breast cancer of 24 years after surgery, and remark for future treatment strategies that not bound by the conventional treatment policy that emphasizes quality of life without aiming for complete cure.",

There is still no consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin, however it is clear that there is a trade-off between widely clear margins and acceptable cosmesis. Preoperative approaches to plan extent of resection with appropriate margins (in the setting of surgery first as well as after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,) include mammography, US, and MRI. Improvements have been made in preoperative lesion localization strategies for surgery, as well as intraoperative specimen assessment, in order to ensure complete removal of imaging findings and facilitate margin clearance. Intraoperative strategies to accurately assess tumor and cavity margins include cavity shave techniques, as well as novel technologies for margin probes. Ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation as well as intraoperative radiation, may be used to extend tumor-free margins without resecting additional tissue. Oncoplastic techniques allow for wider resections while maintaining cosmesis and have acceptable local recurrence rates, however often involve surgery on the contralateral breast. As systemic therapy for breast cancer continues to improve, it is unclear what the importance of surgical margins on local control rates will be in the future."

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor and dual-labeled trastuzumab with both a fluorophore (IRDye800CW) and a radioactive label (111In) can be used for multimodal imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model.MethodsTrastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100\u2009\u03bcg [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48\u2009h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal.ResultsBased on the biodistribution data, a 30\u2009\u03bcg dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13 \u00b1 2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101 \u00b1 7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2 \u00b1 0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression.ConclusionsDual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors."

An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease (Stuart et al., 2011). OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction (Fagotti et al., 2016)(Fagotti et al., 2013) (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness.",

An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease (Stuart et al., 2011). OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction (Fagotti et al., 2016)(Fagotti et al., 2013) (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness."

                "text": "\nImage-guided surgery (IGS) represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, combining real-time imaging technologies with surgical procedures to enhance precision and efficacy. This approach allows surgeons to visualize cancer tissues with greater accuracy during operations, particularly beneficial when treating complex or hard-to-reach tumors. IGS utilizes various imaging modalities including ultrasound, MRI, CT, PET, and fluorescence imaging to provide real-time feedback during surgical procedures. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe effectiveness of IGS varies significantly based on both cancer type and stage. Certain cancers, such as brain tumors, liver cancer, and prostate cancer, are particularly suitable for image-guided approaches due to their anatomical location or proximity to critical structures. Similarly, the stage of cancer plays a crucial role in determining whether IGS is the optimal treatment choice. Early-stage cancers may benefit from the precision of IGS to completely remove localized tumors while preserving healthy tissue, whereas advanced stages might require IGS as part of a multimodal treatment approach. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe decision to use IGS must be individualized, taking into account the specific characteristics of the cancer, patient factors, and available technology.

In breast cancer specifically, stage I and most stage II cancers are ideally treated with Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS), which aims to remove the tumor while preserving surrounding healthy tissue <Paper corpusId=\"218675197\" paperTitle=\"(Kosik et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11774716\" paperTitle=\"(Ananthakrishnan et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This surgical approach relies heavily on various medical imaging systems to precisely localize the tumor, offering greater accuracy than physical examination alone <Paper corpusId=\"218675197\" paperTitle=\"(Kosik et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe detection of smaller, earlier-stage breast cancers has increased significantly due to improved imaging technologies and widespread screening programs. This trend has facilitated the development of less aggressive treatment options for small breast cancers <Paper corpusId=\"24372526\" paperTitle=\"(Roubidoux et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Breast cancer treatment typically begins with surgical excision of the tumor along with a surrounding margin of normal breast tissue, with early-stage disease commonly addressed through breast-conserving surgery or lumpectomy <Paper corpusId=\"246434451\" paperTitle=\"(Goto et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), stage 0-II disease without clinical evidence of regional lymph node or distant metastases can be effectively managed with localized treatments <Paper corpusId=\"231822722\" paperTitle=\"(Yu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, in head and neck cancers, approximately 30-40% of patients with early-stage disease are candidates for either surgery or radiation therapy as a single treatment modality, with both approaches yielding comparable survival outcomes <Paper corpusId=\"250176042\" paperTitle=\"(Domingues et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRadiation therapy protocols have also been refined for early-stage cancers. For example, in selected patients aged 50 or older with small (\u22643 cm), unifocal stage 0-1 breast cancers that have been completely excised with negative margins, accelerated partial breast irradiation using 30 Gy in 5 fractions can be an appropriate option <Paper corpusId=\"279380682\" paperTitle=\"(Radigan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Presurgical MRI is often used in these cases to confirm the extent of disease and guide treatment planning.\n\nMinimally invasive ablation techniques represent another promising approach for early-stage small tumors, potentially achieving similar efficacy to breast-conservation therapy but with better cosmetic results. These less invasive options are particularly valuable for older patients with comorbidities that increase surgical risks <Paper corpusId=\"24372526\" paperTitle=\"(Roubidoux et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Adequate surgical margins in breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer have traditionally been viewed as a predictor of local recurrence rates. There is still no consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin, however it is clear that there is a trade-off between widely clear margins and acceptable cosmesis. Preoperative approaches to plan extent of resection with appropriate margins (in the setting of surgery first as well as after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,) include mammography, US, and MRI. Improvements have been made in preoperative lesion localization strategies for surgery, as well as intraoperative specimen assessment, in order to ensure complete removal of imaging findings and facilitate margin clearance. Intraoperative strategies to accurately assess tumor and cavity margins include cavity shave techniques, as well as novel technologies for margin probes. Ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation as well as intraoperative radiation, may be used to extend tumor-free margins without resecting additional tissue. Oncoplastic techniques allow for wider resections while maintaining cosmesis and have acceptable local recurrence rates, however often involve surgery on the contralateral breast. As systemic therapy for breast cancer continues to improve, it is unclear what the importance of surgical margins on local control rates will be in the future."

                            "In the past 2 decades, new and improved imaging technologies and the use of breast cancer screening have led to the detection of smaller and earlier-stage breast cancers. Furthermore, there has been a trend toward less aggressive treatment of small breast cancers, which has led to the development of less invasive alternatives than surgery with promising effectiveness, and less morbidity. Many patients are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome after breast-conservation therapy. Better cosmesis can be achieved with less invasive techniques. Moreover, less aggressive treatment options would be very useful in patients older than 70 years with comorbidities that make surgery a difficult and sometimes life-threatening treatment. Minimally invasive ablation techniques have been studied in early-stage small tumors with the goal of attaining efficacy similar to that of breast-conservation therapy."

                            "Adequate surgical margins in breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer have traditionally been viewed as a predictor of local recurrence rates. There is still no consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin, however it is clear that there is a trade-off between widely clear margins and acceptable cosmesis. Preoperative approaches to plan extent of resection with appropriate margins (in the setting of surgery first as well as after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,) include mammography, US, and MRI. Improvements have been made in preoperative lesion localization strategies for surgery, as well as intraoperative specimen assessment, in order to ensure complete removal of imaging findings and facilitate margin clearance. Intraoperative strategies to accurately assess tumor and cavity margins include cavity shave techniques, as well as novel technologies for margin probes. Ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation as well as intraoperative radiation, may be used to extend tumor-free margins without resecting additional tissue. Oncoplastic techniques allow for wider resections while maintaining cosmesis and have acceptable local recurrence rates, however often involve surgery on the contralateral breast. As systemic therapy for breast cancer continues to improve, it is unclear what the importance of surgical margins on local control rates will be in the future."

Its application to lung neoplasm was first introduced in 2001 and has been implemented to treat metastatic disease to the lung or in select medically inoperable patients with peripheral stage I NSCLC. IGTA may also be an alternative to treat stage I NSCLC in non-operable patients with interstitial lung disease in whom a radiation modality is deemed too high risk. There are 3 methods of delivery: radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation and cryoablation."

                            "Surgical management of OC remains the cornerstone treatment of the disease (Figure 1). An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease (Stuart et al., 2011). OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction (Fagotti et al., 2016)(Fagotti et al., 2013) (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness."

                "tldr": "Image-guided surgery offers distinct advantages across different cancer stages, with early-stage cancers benefiting from precise tumor removal with tissue preservation, while advanced stages utilize imaging for treatment monitoring and adaptive therapy approaches. These stage-specific benefits help optimize surgical outcomes by ensuring complete tumor removal in early disease and guiding more complex treatment decisions in advanced cases. (7 sources)",
                "text": "\nImage-guided surgery (IGS) provides unique benefits depending on the stage of cancer, allowing for more personalized and effective treatment approaches. For early-stage cancers, particularly stage I and II breast cancers, IGS enables Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) that precisely removes tumors while preserving surrounding healthy tissue. This approach relies on various medical imaging systems to localize tumors with greater accuracy than physical examination alone, resulting in improved outcomes <Paper corpusId=\"218675197\" paperTitle=\"(Kosik et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11774716\" paperTitle=\"(Ananthakrishnan et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe detection of smaller, earlier-stage cancers through advanced imaging technologies has facilitated a trend toward less aggressive treatment options with promising effectiveness and reduced morbidity. For patients concerned about cosmetic outcomes after traditional breast-conservation therapy, minimally invasive ablation techniques guided by imaging can achieve similar efficacy with better cosmetic results. These approaches are particularly valuable for older patients with comorbidities that might make conventional surgery more risky <Paper corpusId=\"24372526\" paperTitle=\"(Roubidoux et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor advanced-stage cancers, image guidance plays a crucial role in determining the extent of disease and planning comprehensive treatment strategies. Surgery often forms part of a more extensive treatment approach that may include neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies <Paper corpusId=\"246432806\" paperTitle=\"(Lauwerends et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. In these cases, imaging not only guides the surgical procedure but also helps monitor treatment response. For example, in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, an image-guided approach can be used to tailor treatment duration based on early response assessment, allowing for surgery to be performed after achieving radiologic complete response rather than completing a predetermined number of chemotherapy cycles <Paper corpusId=\"257326144\" paperTitle=\"(Voort et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPreoperative imaging significantly impacts treatment planning across all cancer stages. For breast cancer specifically, the extent and stage at initial presentation determine available treatment options and prognosis. While mammography and image-guided biopsy establish the baseline disease extent, additional imaging modalities such as MRI can reveal further multifocal or multicentric disease that might alter the surgical approach. Lymph node status, a critical prognostic factor, can be assessed through various imaging techniques including ultrasound, MRI, and nuclear medicine approaches like positron emission tomography (PET), though with variable accuracy <Paper corpusId=\"267861895\" paperTitle=\"(Gilbert, 2002)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor early-stage non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), image-guided superficial radiotherapy (IGSRT) offers an alternative to surgical approaches, particularly beneficial for poor surgical candidates or patients who prefer to avoid surgery. IGSRT has been shown to be clinically equivalent to Mohs micrographic surgery and statistically superior to non-image-guided superficial radiotherapy for these early-stage cases <Paper corpusId=\"272548346\" paperTitle=\"(Farberg et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Adequate surgical margins in breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer have traditionally been viewed as a predictor of local recurrence rates. There is still no consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin, however it is clear that there is a trade-off between widely clear margins and acceptable cosmesis. Preoperative approaches to plan extent of resection with appropriate margins (in the setting of surgery first as well as after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,) include mammography, US, and MRI. Improvements have been made in preoperative lesion localization strategies for surgery, as well as intraoperative specimen assessment, in order to ensure complete removal of imaging findings and facilitate margin clearance. Intraoperative strategies to accurately assess tumor and cavity margins include cavity shave techniques, as well as novel technologies for margin probes. Ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation as well as intraoperative radiation, may be used to extend tumor-free margins without resecting additional tissue. Oncoplastic techniques allow for wider resections while maintaining cosmesis and have acceptable local recurrence rates, however often involve surgery on the contralateral breast. As systemic therapy for breast cancer continues to improve, it is unclear what the importance of surgical margins on local control rates will be in the future."

Furthermore, there has been a trend toward less aggressive treatment of small breast cancers, which has led to the development of less invasive alternatives than surgery with promising effectiveness, and less morbidity. Many patients are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome after breast-conservation therapy. Better cosmesis can be achieved with less invasive techniques. Moreover, less aggressive treatment options would be very useful in patients older than 70 years with comorbidities that make surgery a difficult and sometimes life-threatening treatment. Minimally invasive ablation techniques have been studied in early-stage small tumors with the goal of attaining efficacy similar to that of breast-conservation therapy."

IGTA may also be an alternative to treat stage I NSCLC in non-operable patients with interstitial lung disease in whom a radiation modality is deemed too high risk.

                            "In the past 2 decades, new and improved imaging technologies and the use of breast cancer screening have led to the detection of smaller and earlier-stage breast cancers. Furthermore, there has been a trend toward less aggressive treatment of small breast cancers, which has led to the development of less invasive alternatives than surgery with promising effectiveness, and less morbidity. Many patients are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome after breast-conservation therapy. Better cosmesis can be achieved with less invasive techniques. Moreover, less aggressive treatment options would be very useful in patients older than 70 years with comorbidities that make surgery a difficult and sometimes life-threatening treatment. Minimally invasive ablation techniques have been studied in early-stage small tumors with the goal of attaining efficacy similar to that of breast-conservation therapy."

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor and dual-labeled trastuzumab with both a fluorophore (IRDye800CW) and a radioactive label (111In) can be used for multimodal imaging of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of HER2-targeted multimodal imaging using [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW in an orthotopic breast cancer model.MethodsTrastuzumab was conjugated with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl (ITC)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and IRDye800CW-NHS ester and subsequently labeled with 111In. In a dose escalation study, the biodistribution of 10, 30, and 100\u2009\u03bcg [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW was determined 48\u2009h after injection in BALB/c nude mice with orthotopic high HER2-expressing tumors. Also, a biodistribution study was performed in a low HER2-expressing breast cancer model. In addition, multimodal image-guided surgery was performed in each group. Autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemically stained slices of the tumors were compared for co-localization of tumor tissue, HER2 expression, fluorescence, and radiosignal.ResultsBased on the biodistribution data, a 30\u2009\u03bcg dose of dual-labeled trastuzumab (tumor-to-blood ratio 13 \u00b1 2) was chosen for all subsequent studies. [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW specifically accumulated in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 tumors (101 \u00b1 7 %IA/g), whereas uptake in orthotopic low HER2-expressing MCF7 tumor was significantly lower (1.2 \u00b1 0.2 %IA/g, p = 0.007). BT474 tumors could clearly be visualized with both micro-SPECT/CT, fluorescence imaging and subsequently, image-guided resection was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses of BT474 tumors demonstrated correspondence in fluorescence, radiosignal, and high HER2 expression.ConclusionsDual-labeled trastuzumab showed specific accumulation in orthotopic HER2-positive BT474 breast tumors with micro-SPECT/CT and fluorescence imaging and enabled image-guided tumor resection. In the clinical setting, [111In]In-DTPA-trastuzumab-IRDye800CW could be valuable for preoperative detection of (metastatic) tumors by SPECT/CT imaging, and intraoperative localization by using a gamma probe and fluorescence image-guided surgery to improve radical resection of tumor tissue in patients with HER2-positive tumors."

                "text": "\nThe landscape of image-guided cancer surgery continues to evolve with promising technological innovations aimed at improving surgical precision and patient outcomes. One significant advancement is the development of dual-labeled antibodies that combine fluorescent and radioactive labels for multimodal imaging. For example, trastuzumab labeled with both IRDye800CW (fluorescent) and 111In (radioactive) has demonstrated specific accumulation in HER2-positive breast tumors, enabling both pre-operative visualization through micro-SPECT/CT imaging and intraoperative guidance during tumor resection. <Paper corpusId=\"238199127\" paperTitle=\"(Naidoo et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"208190966\" paperTitle=\"(Deken et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn clinical applications, these dual-labeled antibodies could significantly enhance surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to detect tumors preoperatively with SPECT/CT imaging and then precisely locate and remove them intraoperatively using both gamma probes and fluorescence imaging. This approach shows particular promise for improving complete tumor resection in patients with HER2-positive malignancies. <Paper corpusId=\"238199127\" paperTitle=\"(Naidoo et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"208190966\" paperTitle=\"(Deken et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe concept of personalized cancer treatment is also advancing through image-guided approaches. For instance, sentinel node (SN) navigation surgery is emerging as a promising less invasive personalized treatment for early-stage esophageal cancer, though further multicenter trials using standardized protocols are still needed to establish its efficacy. <Paper corpusId=\"59410791\" paperTitle=\"(Takeuchi et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> Similarly, for patients with unifocal breast cancer, wire-guided localization (WGL) combined with multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) guided 3D reconstruction techniques are being developed to achieve improved cosmetic outcomes. <Paper corpusId=\"279367129\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAdaptive treatment approaches guided by imaging are also showing promise. Researchers have evaluated an image-guided approach to tailor chemotherapy duration based on early response assessment. In this model, response to treatment is monitored every three cycles, and patients achieving radiologic complete response (rCR) are referred for surgery rather than completing a predetermined number of chemotherapy cycles. This approach potentially reduces unnecessary treatment and associated toxicity while maintaining efficacy. <Paper corpusId=\"257326144\" paperTitle=\"(Voort et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn ovarian cancer management, fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness, which is considered the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease. <Paper corpusId=\"52270092\" paperTitle=\"(Lorenzo et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> This approach could potentially enhance the surgeon's ability to identify and remove microscopic disease that might otherwise be missed with conventional visual and tactile assessment.\n\nRadiation therapy is also evolving with technological advancements that complement surgical approaches. These include intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), radioimmunotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). <Paper corpusId=\"55378429\" paperTitle=\"(Nawab, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> These technologies allow for more precise targeting of tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissues, potentially improving both the efficacy and safety profiles of cancer treatments.\n\nAs these emerging technologies continue to develop and undergo clinical validation, they promise to further refine the application of image-guided surgery across different cancer types and stages, potentially expanding treatment options for patients and improving long-term outcomes.",

                            "Surgical management of OC remains the cornerstone treatment of the disease (Figure 1). An adequate full surgical staging in women with early stage disease has been demonstrated to improve outcome. In fact, complete surgical cytoreduction is considered to be the only modifiable prognostic factor for patients with advanced disease (Stuart et al., 2011). OC surgery is essentially a laparotomic surgery; the laparoscopic technique can be used in the early stages, in restaging surgery, and in advanced stages for the assessment of disease to evaluate the possibility of optimal primary cytoreduction (Fagotti et al., 2016)(Fagotti et al., 2013) (Figure 2). Goals of primary surgery for ovarian cancer are proper staging (in early disease) and optimal cytoreduction/debulking (in advanced disease). Optimal debulking surgery is defined as surgery that results in no macroscopic residual disease. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) is an alternative treatment option for patients who are unlikely to undergo PDS. Fluorescence image-guided surgery represents a promising intraoperative guidance technique to improve debulking completeness."
