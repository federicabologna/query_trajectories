            "abstract": "In this state-of-the-art review we detail the journey of xenotransplantation from its infancy, detailing one of the first published cases and the subsequent journey the field took in its inception and development. With a focus on the science, technological advances, precautions required along with the potential limitations in application, the ethics, guidance\u2019s, and legislative advances that are required to reach the safe and efficacious clinical application of xenotransplantation. Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.",

With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.",

A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation. From the first recorded attempt of a xeno-blood transfusion to the current advent of successful clinical xenotransplants of transgenic pig organs to humans.",

Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).",

Hawthorne\n## Abstract\nIn this state-of-the-art review we detail the journey of xenotransplantation from its infancy, detailing one of the first published cases and the subsequent journey the field took in its inception and development. With a focus on the science, technological advances, precautions required along with the potential limitations in application, the ethics, guidance\u2019s, and legislative advances that are required to reach the safe and efficacious clinical application of xenotransplantation. Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.\n## Introduction\nHowever, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic. With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.\n\n## Historical perspective\nJaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman. Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).\n\n## Major ethical considerations\nThe remarkable potential of xenotransplantation to address the critical shortage of human organs has been met with considerable ethical scrutiny, raising profound questions and dilemmas that must be thoughtfully addressed. A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation. From the first recorded attempt of a xeno-blood transfusion to the current advent of successful clinical xenotransplants of transgenic pig organs to humans.\n\n## Public and regulatory support\nAddressing these ethical concerns is not only a moral imperative but also crucial for gaining public and regulatory support for xenotransplantation. Public perception of the ethics surrounding xenotransplantation can significantly influence its acceptance and, consequently, the regulatory environment. As such there has been significant engagement with both societal and religious organizations to ensure robust understanding of the key concepts and garner opinion and support (6,35,36). \n\nThe IXA has endeavored to undertake public engagement with ongoing dialogue which are essential to fostering trust with transparency and acceptance. It is incumbent on the broader scientific community and policymakers to communicate the steps taken to mitigate ethical concerns and to provide evidence of the rigorous ethical oversight and animal welfare standards applied in xenotransplantation research. Furthermore the governing organization of xenotransplantation the IXA is maintaining its mission to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality by; fostering the science of xenotransplantation through promotion of ethical clinical and pre-clinical research, productive discourse, and collaboration; along with further educating health care providers and lay persons through broad, representative participation interactive public debate; and also guiding the development of scientifically sound, internationally consistent public policy that is responsive to new developments in the field and acknowledges varying social, ethical and legal frameworks (37). Along with ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and other agencies to ensure they balance the advancement of science but safeguarding the ethical principles. This is actively being undertaken with a strong push from the IXA to engage numerous agencies globally to ensure this continues to occur and keep pace with the rapidly developing technologies (8).",

            "abstract": "Xenotransplantation is emerging as a vital solution to the critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, significantly propelled by advancements in genetic engineering and the development of sophisticated immunosuppressive treatments. Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to navigate the ethical, medical, and logistical complexities of introducing kidney xenotransplantation into mainstream clinical practice, but also itself marks a new era in organ transplantation.",

                    "text": "These include genes for human complement regulatory proteins (hCD46 and hCD55), which help protect the transplanted organ from the recipient's immune system, and genes like human thrombomodulin (hTBM) and human endothelial protein C receptor (hEPCR), which work to prevent clotting and improve graft survival (6-11) (Figure 1). \n\nResearch institutions, such as the University of Alabama, have made significant strides by utilizing pigs with a comprehensive suite of genetic modifications, including enhancements to immune regulation and coagulation profiles, as well as the removal of specific antigens known to trigger rejection (12). This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.",

This transition from laboratory success to real-world efficacy underscores the importance of preclinical research as an essential step. This phase serves not only to validate findings from controlled laboratory settings in more clinically relevant scenarios but also to identify unforeseen challenges that may not be apparent in initial studies. The intricate dance between clinical application and laboratory research is informed by these challenges, directing the trajectory of future investigations. The exploration of genetically engineered pigs, particularly those modified with multiple genes, marks a significant advancement in this field (3). However, delving deeper into the specific functions of these genetic modifications and the discovery of new xenoantigens remain critical areas for further research. The protracted process of breeding these genetically altered pigs also poses a logistical challenge, emphasizing the need for streamlining breeding techniques to enhance research efficiency. \n\nThe ethical considerations surrounding the selection of participants for clinical trials, especially the inclusion of end-stage renal disease patients or those not eligible for conventional transplants, continue to provoke debate. Alternatively, the use of brain-dead individuals in preclinical studies presents a less contentious pathway, aligning with both ethical standards and research needs. Meanwhile, the quest for optimal immunosuppression strategies remains ongoing, with the current regimens requiring refinement to improve outcomes and reduce adverse effects. The consistency in selecting donor genotypes and standardizing perioperative care protocols also presents a significant hurdle, mirroring the complexity of translating xenotransplantation into a clinically viable option. Persistent issues such as graft rejection, inflammation, coagulation disorders, maintaining the physiological function of transplanted kidneys, and managing the risk of viral transmission underscore the multifaceted challenges ahead. \n\nAs preclinical research progresses, it is imperative to tackle these obstacles head-on, paving the way for the successful integration of xenotransplantation into clinical practice.

Furthermore, the\n\n## Introduction\nThe journey toward the clinical application of porcine-to-human kidney transplants is fraught with uncertainties, necessitating rigorous investigation and ethical deliberation. \n\nThe exploration of xenotransplantation, as a viable source of kidneys for transplantation, is gaining momentum, underpinned by the pressing need to address the organ shortage crisis. This approach not only promises to expand the donor pool but also to pioneer new frontiers in transplantation medicine (4). Advances in genetic modification techniques aim to enhance organ compatibility and reduce the likelihood of rejection and cross-species infection, marking a significant leap towards making xenotransplantation a reality for patients in need (4). \n\nMoreover, the field of xenotransplantation is evolving alongside considerations of ethical standards and regulatory frameworks, ensuring that the development and potential clinical implementation are conducted with the utmost care for safety and ethical integrity. As the scientific community continues to unravel the complexities of xenogeneic organ transplantation, the collective goal remains clear: to provide a sustainable, ethical solution to the organ shortage crisis, ultimately saving more lives through innovative medical breakthroughs (5). \n\nIn essence, the path forward in xenotransplantation research and its prospective clinical application is laden with challenges yet brimming with potential. Through continued interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous ethical scrutiny, and innovative scientific inquiry, xenotransplantation holds the promise of significantly impacting the future of organ transplantation, offering hope to countless individuals awaiting life-saving transplants.\n\n## Donor selection in kidney transplantation\nThese include genes for human complement regulatory proteins (hCD46 and hCD55), which help protect the transplanted organ from the recipient's immune system, and genes like human thrombomodulin (hTBM) and human endothelial protein C receptor (hEPCR), which work to prevent clotting and improve graft survival (6-11) (Figure 1). \n\nResearch institutions, such as the University of Alabama, have made significant strides by utilizing pigs with a comprehensive suite of genetic modifications, including enhancements to immune regulation and coagulation profiles, as well as the removal of specific antigens known to trigger rejection (12). This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.\n...\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Navigating these complexities will require concerted efforts from researchers, ethicists, and policymakers, with the ultimate goal of making xenotransplantation a safe, ethical, and effective solution for the millions worldwide in need of life-saving organ transplants.\n\n## Conclusion and perspectives\nXenotransplantation has shown considerable promise in earlystage studies, bridging a critical gap between theoretical potential and practical clinical application (31). This transition from laboratory success to real-world efficacy underscores the importance of preclinical research as an essential step. This phase serves not only to validate findings from controlled laboratory settings in more clinically relevant scenarios but also to identify unforeseen challenges that may not be apparent in initial studies. The intricate dance between clinical application and laboratory research is informed by these challenges, directing the trajectory of future investigations. The exploration of genetically engineered pigs, particularly those modified with multiple genes, marks a significant advancement in this field (3). However, delving deeper into the specific functions of these genetic modifications and the discovery of new xenoantigens remain critical areas for further research. The protracted process of breeding these genetically altered pigs also poses a logistical challenge, emphasizing the need for streamlining breeding techniques to enhance research efficiency. \n\nThe ethical considerations surrounding the selection of participants for clinical trials, especially the inclusion of end-stage renal disease patients or those not eligible for conventional transplants, continue to provoke debate. Alternatively, the use of brain-dead individuals in preclinical studies presents a less contentious pathway, aligning with both ethical standards and research needs. Meanwhile, the quest for optimal immunosuppression strategies remains ongoing, with the current regimens requiring refinement to improve outcomes and reduce adverse effects. The consistency in selecting donor genotypes and standardizing perioperative care protocols also presents a significant hurdle, mirroring the complexity of translating xenotransplantation into a clinically viable option. Persistent issues such as graft rejection, inflammation, coagulation disorders, maintaining the physiological function of transplanted kidneys, and managing the risk of viral transmission underscore the multifaceted challenges ahead. \n\nAs preclinical research progresses, it is imperative to tackle these obstacles head-on, paving the way for the successful integration of xenotransplantation into clinical practice. The future of this innovative field hinges on our ability to navigate these complexities, requiring a concerted effort from researchers, clinicians, and ethicists alike.",

And, as we know from the rise of industrial agriculture and the history of animal research, human benefit usually wins. \n\nThe template I have just outlined works very well for all aspects of biotechnology including agriculture, animal research, creation of animal models of human genetic disease, and the topic at hand, xenotransplantation. In fact, xenotransplantation provides a textbook example of all of the above categories. Approximately 3500 to 4000 people seek heart transplants per year in the U.S. As a result, alternatives to human donors have been sought. One putatively plausible alternative has been to use animals, specifically pigs, although historically baboons and other animals have been utilized. There are no cases reported of humans surviving with pig hearts. \n\nConsider the use of pig hearts for people needing heart transplants. (This is overwhelmingly the primary use of xenotransplantation that has been discussed.) There exist very real dangers in using animal organs for transplantation, specifically on microbiological, physiological, and immunological levels. There are also animal welfare issues associated with such uses, albeit subtle ones. Finally, there are extremely clear examples of bad ethics supplanting and eclipsing good ethics in discussions of xenotransplantation.",

Rollin\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary The dream of transferring bodily organs from animals to humans goes back to antiquity, as articulated in the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.\n## Introduction\nAspect three, the effect of genetic engineering on the welfare of the animals engineered, was a truly ethical issue, as it almost invariably pitted the well-being of the animals against human well-being. And, as we know from the rise of industrial agriculture and the history of animal research, human benefit usually wins. \n\nThe template I have just outlined works very well for all aspects of biotechnology including agriculture, animal research, creation of animal models of human genetic disease, and the topic at hand, xenotransplantation. In fact, xenotransplantation provides a textbook example of all of the above categories. Approximately 3500 to 4000 people seek heart transplants per year in the U.S. As a result, alternatives to human donors have been sought. One putatively plausible alternative has been to use animals, specifically pigs, although historically baboons and other animals have been utilized. There are no cases reported of humans surviving with pig hearts. \n\nConsider the use of pig hearts for people needing heart transplants. (This is overwhelmingly the primary use of xenotransplantation that has been discussed.) There exist very real dangers in using animal organs for transplantation, specifically on microbiological, physiological, and immunological levels. There are also animal welfare issues associated with such uses, albeit subtle ones. Finally, there are extremely clear examples of bad ethics supplanting and eclipsing good ethics in discussions of xenotransplantation.",

Physiological counterbalance systems, like human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor upregulation in porcine xenografts, highlight efforts for graft survival enhancement. Evaluating pig and baboon donors and challenges with non-human primates illuminates complexities in donor species selection. Ethical considerations, encompassing animal rights, welfare, and zoonotic disease risks, are critically examined in the cXT context. The review delves into immune control mechanisms with aggressive immunosuppression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, elucidating hyperacute rejection, complement activation, and antibody-mediated rejection intricacies. CRISPR/Cas9\u2019s role in creating pig endothelial cells expressing human inhibitor molecules is explored for rejection mitigation. Ethical and regulatory aspects emphasize the role of committees and international guidelines. A forward-looking perspective envisions precision medical genetics, artificial intelligence, and individualized heart cultivation within pigs as transformative elements in cXT\u2019s future is also explored. This comprehensive analysis offers insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, addressing the current state, and future prospects of cXT.",

Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

Dinh\n## Abstract\nCardiac xenotransplantation (cXT) has emerged as a solution to heart donor scarcity, prompting an exploration of its scientific, ethical, and regulatory facets. The review begins with genetic modifications enhancing pig hearts for human transplantation, navigating through immunological challenges, rejection mechanisms, and immune responses. Key areas include preclinical milestones, complement cascade roles, and genetic engineering to address hyperacute rejection. Physiological counterbalance systems, like human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor upregulation in porcine xenografts, highlight efforts for graft survival enhancement. Evaluating pig and baboon donors and challenges with non-human primates illuminates complexities in donor species selection. Ethical considerations, encompassing animal rights, welfare, and zoonotic disease risks, are critically examined in the cXT context. The review delves into immune control mechanisms with aggressive immunosuppression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, elucidating hyperacute rejection, complement activation, and antibody-mediated rejection intricacies. CRISPR/Cas9\u2019s role in creating pig endothelial cells expressing human inhibitor molecules is explored for rejection mitigation. Ethical and regulatory aspects emphasize the role of committees and international guidelines. A forward-looking perspective envisions precision medical genetics, artificial intelligence, and individualized heart cultivation within pigs as transformative elements in cXT\u2019s future is also explored. This comprehensive analysis offers insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, addressing the current state, and future prospects of cXT.\n## Ethical and Regulatory Aspects\nXenotransplantation is fraught with numerous ethical and social dilemmas, encompassing substantial costs and resource allocations essential for the research endeavor. Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19]. \n\nCardiac xenotransplantation is also actively being explored for pediatric patients-a population in which few therapeutic options exist at all. Successful xenotransplantation could represent a bridge to allotransplantation or a potential long-term solution for this vulnerable population. Genetically modified pig hearts offer considerable promise in alleviating growing waitlists and reducing high mortality rates among pediatric patients [20]. However, the ethical challenges surrounding pediatric xenotransplantation are complex. Issues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials. Efforts to address these challenges include developing transparent patient selection frameworks prioritizing medical need, equitable access, and rigorous informed consent processes, particularly for vulnerable groups such as pediatric patients [21]. By integrating these considerations, the field can progress in a way that balances innovation with justice and beneficence",

Ladowski, Raphael P. H. Meier\n## Abstract\nThis review highlights groundbreaking progress from July to December 2024, including developments in gene\u2010edited pigs, cellular therapies, organ preservation, and transplantation techniques. Recent advancements, particularly in gene\u2010editing technologies and immunosuppressive protocols, have brought the field closer to clinical application. While significant ethical, immunological, and societal challenges remain, this progress underscores the immense potential of xenotransplantation to revolutionize transplantation medicine.\n## Ethical and Regulatory Challenges\nThe ethical framework of xenotransplantation continues to evolve in response to societal reactions and public discourse surrounding early cases of xenotransplantation. These discussions highlighted tensions between scientific progress and societal ethical standards, underscoring the need for proactive public engagement to build trust and address normative judgments that influence societal acceptance and regulatory approaches to emerging biotechnologies [15]. The progression toward clinical xenotransplantation trials necessitates a patient selection process grounded in medical need, capacity to benefit, patient choice, and compliance to achieve ethically sound and scientifically valuable outcomes [16,17]. \n\nA recent UK symposium, endorsed by the British Transplantation Society and the European Society of Organ Transplantation, highlighted advancements in gene-edited animal models and addressed key ethical, regulatory, and technical challenges in translating xenotransplantation into clinical practice. While focused on the United Kingdom, the discussions provided globally applicable insights into unresolved legal and ethical issues [18].\n\n## Patient Selection and Equity\nOne of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in xenotransplantation is the selection of patients for clinical trials. Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19]. \n\nCardiac xenotransplantation is also actively being explored for pediatric patients-a population in which few therapeutic options exist at all. Successful xenotransplantation could represent a bridge to allotransplantation or a potential long-term solution for this vulnerable population. Genetically modified pig hearts offer considerable promise in alleviating growing waitlists and reducing high mortality rates among pediatric patients [20]. However, the ethical challenges surrounding pediatric xenotransplantation are complex. Issues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials. Efforts to address these challenges include developing transparent patient selection frameworks prioritizing medical need, equitable access, and rigorous informed consent processes, particularly for vulnerable groups such as pediatric patients [21]. By integrating these considerations, the field can progress in a way that balances innovation with justice and beneficence\n\n## Animal Welfare\nThe use of genetically modified pigs for xenotransplantation has always raised moral concerns regarding animal welfare. To address these concerns, the concept of \"genetic disenhancement,\" modifying pigs to reduce their capacity for pain and suffering, has been theoretically proposed. While the specifics behind the concept are unclear, this could represent a future temporary ethical compromise until viable non-animal alternatives are developed [26].",

This has made the generation of genetically bespoke organisms a reality. This paper will analyze the regulatory and practical aspects of such an innovative approach to xenotransplantation on the basis of a hypothetical case study applied to Germany and highlight the gaps in the current regulation. This paper thus provides the basis for legal debate within a specific country. In addition, the identified gaps also pose a barrier toward the harmonization of international regulation. This publication therefore lays the groundwork for guiding the international debate regarding the regulatory framework for solid organ xenotransplantation toward specific issues.\n## Results and discussion\nA continued, systematic debate on common standards should therefore be a priority.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous ethical issues pertaining to xenotransplantation, which have been discussed for years (28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33) and fall into three broad categories: the first argues that certain scientific experiments should simply not be undertaken; the second warns of unforeseen consequences of genetically altering organisms; and the third pertains to the suffering of involved animals.In addition, there is a continuous and heated debate about the permissibility of mixing animal and human material in the academic (34-36) as well as the public sector (37)(38)(39).\n\nThese ethical and legal questions need to be addressed before such an approach ever becomes routine.",

Thanks to it, it became possible to study the functions and mechanisms of biology with greater precision, as well as to obtain genetically modified organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The changes introduced by the CRISPR/Cas system are based on the repair paths of the single or double strand DNA breaks that cause insertions, deletions, or precise integrations of donor DNA. These changes are crucial for many fields of science, one of which is the use of animals (pigs) as a reservoir of tissues and organs for xenotransplantation into humans. Non-genetically modified animals cannot be used to save human life and health due to acute immunological reactions resulting from the phylogenetic distance of these two species. This review is intended to collect and summarize the advantages as well as achievements of the CRISPR/Cas system in pig-to-human xenotransplantation research. In addition, it demonstrates barriers and limitations that require careful evaluation before attempting to experiment with this technology.",

                    "text": "Despite the many advantages of xenotransplantation, there are some ethical, legal, and social aspects that must be regulated and considered. First, there are no international legal regulations for pig-to-human xenotransplantation [139]. Their establishment is one of the major milestones in the introduction of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Apart from the lack of legal regulations, introducing xenotransplantation into clinical practice requires a discussion in the society combined with explanation of procedures and knowledge bases. There are concerns that some societies will oppose pig-to-human xenotransplantation because of religious and cultural aspects [140]. Moreover, there is a probability that the use of organs from modified pigs, in some countries, may lead to a global trend of reducing the number of human transplants for altruistic reasons [141]. At this moment, we are unable to predict the reaction of society to a person carrying an animal organ. The social acceptance and the fear of social rejection may pose a risk of a medical procedure refusal by patient. Therefore, there is a need for xenograft recipient anonymity. \n\nThe ethical aspects of xenotransplantation mainly concern the use of animals, namely pigs. Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species [142]. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate all alternatives that could replace animal organs and save patients' lives before introducing pig-to-human xenotransplantation into clinical practice [143]. These alternatives so far include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells and tissue engineering [144]. Thus far, no alternative has been found that would be able to fully replace the functionality of the human organ.",

Hryhorowicz, J. Zeyland, D. Lipinski, R. S\u0142omski\n## Abstract\nCRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats linked to Cas nuclease) technology has revolutionized many aspects of genetic engineering research. Thanks to it, it became possible to study the functions and mechanisms of biology with greater precision, as well as to obtain genetically modified organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The changes introduced by the CRISPR/Cas system are based on the repair paths of the single or double strand DNA breaks that cause insertions, deletions, or precise integrations of donor DNA. These changes are crucial for many fields of science, one of which is the use of animals (pigs) as a reservoir of tissues and organs for xenotransplantation into humans. Non-genetically modified animals cannot be used to save human life and health due to acute immunological reactions resulting from the phylogenetic distance of these two species. This review is intended to collect and summarize the advantages as well as achievements of the CRISPR/Cas system in pig-to-human xenotransplantation research. In addition, it demonstrates barriers and limitations that require careful evaluation before attempting to experiment with this technology.\n## Legal, Social and Ethical Concerns\nDespite the many advantages of xenotransplantation, there are some ethical, legal, and social aspects that must be regulated and considered. First, there are no international legal regulations for pig-to-human xenotransplantation [139]. Their establishment is one of the major milestones in the introduction of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Apart from the lack of legal regulations, introducing xenotransplantation into clinical practice requires a discussion in the society combined with explanation of procedures and knowledge bases. There are concerns that some societies will oppose pig-to-human xenotransplantation because of religious and cultural aspects [140]. Moreover, there is a probability that the use of organs from modified pigs, in some countries, may lead to a global trend of reducing the number of human transplants for altruistic reasons [141]. At this moment, we are unable to predict the reaction of society to a person carrying an animal organ. The social acceptance and the fear of social rejection may pose a risk of a medical procedure refusal by patient. Therefore, there is a need for xenograft recipient anonymity. \n\nThe ethical aspects of xenotransplantation mainly concern the use of animals, namely pigs. Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species [142]. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate all alternatives that could replace animal organs and save patients' lives before introducing pig-to-human xenotransplantation into clinical practice [143]. These alternatives so far include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells and tissue engineering [144]. Thus far, no alternative has been found that would be able to fully replace the functionality of the human organ.",

This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

In this review, we will examine the obstacles overcome and those yet to be conquered, discussing the human trials performed and the questions they raised. Additionally, we will revisit overlooked aspects that may be crucial for improvements and suggest future approaches for xenotransplant research. Recent Findings Improving survival in pig-to-non-human-primate models with the identification of an ideal immunosuppression regimen led to 3 cases of kidney xenotransplant in brain-dead humans with limited follow-up and a single clinical case of pig-to-human heart xenotransplant with 2-month survival. Summary With limited human results and unlimited potential, xenotransplantation shines a beacon of hope for a brighter future. However, we must navigate through the complexities of balancing scientific progress and patient welfare, avoiding being blinded by xenotransplantation\u2019s unquestionable potential.\n## Regulatory, Legal, and Ethical Concerns\nDespite the formidable genetic obstacles posed by current protocols, regulatory, legal, and ethical considerations may pose an even greater challenge for xenotransplant implementation.\n\nMany animal rights organizations are against the use of animals for research, including xenotransplantation.\n\nOthers argue that scientists may disturb the fundamental nature of a species, despite the fact that selective breeding has caused more extensive modifications than the ten genetic alterations engineered for xenotransplantation [69].\n\nAs xenotransplant may lead to zoonotic diseases with public health implications, one of the most challenging aspects of its implementation is the possible requirement of life-long monitoring for patients and their close contacts [70]. This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

Of particular concern is tissue-specific gene expression. For example, transgenes that are only expressed in the liver will not be effective in kidney xenotransplantation. On a more granular level, studies have shown that human CD47 expression in pig endothelial cells and podocytes prevented phagocytosis by correcting CD47-SIRPa species incompatibilities and enabling normal SIRPa signal transduction. Indeed, hCD47 expression on podocytes in hCD47/GalTKO pig-tobaboon kidney transplants was shown to inhibit the development of proteinuria (59)..

Chee, Kyung-Hee Kim, I. Jeong, Jung-Sun Kim, Chang-Ha Lee, Jeong Wook Seo\n## Abstract\nAuthor's summary On January 7th, 2022, a historical event of pig-to-human cardiac xenotransplantation was performed using genetically engineered porcine xenograft and co-stimulation blockade-based immunosuppression. Though the patient developed xenograft failure and succumbed to death on post-operative day 60, this event shed light on the cumulative effect of scientists and physicians who worked hard to unveil the underlying immunobiology of cross-species organ transplantation. In this review, we will summarize major advances along the history of cardiac xenotransplantation, current status in Korea, and remaining challenges.\n## Social and ethical barriers\nMajor ethical concern regarding xenotransplantation is about animal rights. 76) Specifically, putting the rights of human beings above all the rights of the other species could be viewed as too anthropocentric, and growing concern lies on the magnitude and extent of genetic modification. Porcine organs are the most well studied xenograft models, however, handling pigs is forbidden in certain cultural and religious background, therefore fair and proper allocation of porcine xenografts would be very challenging. \n\nThough overall disease burden of heart failure is significant, clinical implementation of xenotransplantation would require markedly higher amount of medical expenditure, for it",

The shortage of donor organs is the main limiting factor for successful transplantation in humans. Except living donations, other alternatives are needed, e.g., xenotransplantation of pig organs. However, immune rejection remains the major challenge to overcome in xenotransplantation. There are three different xenogeneic types of rejections, based on the responses and mechanisms involved. It includes hyperacute rejection (HAR), delayed xenograft rejection (DXR) and chronic rejection. DXR, sometimes involves acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHR) and cellular xenograft rejection (CXR), which cannot be strictly distinguished from each other in pathological process. In this review, we comprehensively discussed the mechanism of these immunological rejections and summarized the strategies for preventing them, such as generation of gene knock out donors by different genome editing tools and the use of immunosuppressive regimens. We also addressed organ-specific barriers and challenges needed to pave the way for clinical xenotransplantation. Taken together, this information will benefit the current immunological research in the field of xenotransplantation.",

Deng, Chunming Cheng, Yi Wang\n## Abstract\nTransplantation is often the last resort for end-stage organ failures, e.g., kidney, liver, heart, lung, and pancreas. The shortage of donor organs is the main limiting factor for successful transplantation in humans. Except living donations, other alternatives are needed, e.g., xenotransplantation of pig organs. However, immune rejection remains the major challenge to overcome in xenotransplantation. There are three different xenogeneic types of rejections, based on the responses and mechanisms involved. It includes hyperacute rejection (HAR), delayed xenograft rejection (DXR) and chronic rejection. DXR, sometimes involves acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHR) and cellular xenograft rejection (CXR), which cannot be strictly distinguished from each other in pathological process. In this review, we comprehensively discussed the mechanism of these immunological rejections and summarized the strategies for preventing them, such as generation of gene knock out donors by different genome editing tools and the use of immunosuppressive regimens. We also addressed organ-specific barriers and challenges needed to pave the way for clinical xenotransplantation. Taken together, this information will benefit the current immunological research in the field of xenotransplantation.\n## Organ-specific barriers and challenges\nIn recent years, a number of pig-to-NHP preclinical xenotransplantation studies have been performed with various organs. While HAR has been alleviated owing to gene-editing technologies, DXR and chronic rejection remain urgent issues to be solved. Another concern focuses on PERVs transmission, which is a major hurdle to the clinical use of pig cells, tissues, and organs for treatment of organ failure in humans. However, it is still uncertain whether PERVs is pathogenic to humans, or if it could recombine with hERVs to form new viruses. Genetic engineering techniques such as CRIPSR/Cas9 genome editing system could prevent their activation or delete them from the pig cells (245,246). Further, the ethical issues around xenotransplantation have not been sufficiently discussed. Strict medical and ethical guidelines and regulations are needed before clinical applications can be tried on selected patients. Beyond the common ethical and technical issues shared by the different areas of xenotransplantation, there are also organ-specific barriers that are briefly addressed below.",

King\u2019s College London, with endorsement from the British Transplantation Society (BTS), and the European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT), brought together a group of experts in xenotransplantation science, ethics and law to discuss the ethical, regulatory and technical challenges surrounding translating xenotransplantation into the clinical setting. The symposium was the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years. This paper summarises the content of the expert lectures showcasing the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including\u2014the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and progress towards clinical xenotransplantation. We then set out the ethical and legal issues still to be resolved. Finally, we report the themes of the roundtable discussion highlighting areas of consensus and controversy. While the detail of the legal discussion was directed towards the UK, the principles and summary reported here are intended to be applicable to any jurisdiction seeking to implement clinical xenotransplantation.",

In 1969, the Nobel winning transplant immunologist Peter Medawar hypothesised that We should solve the problem [of organ transplantation] by using heterografts [xenografts]  one day if we try hard enough, and maybe in less than 15 years. 1 More than 20 years later, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics predicted that the first pig to human xenotransplants would be performed in 1996. 2 What followed was almost 30 more years of intense research focused on the remaining immunological and infectious challenges. However, in 2022, xenotransplantation was thrust back into mainstream transplant discourse following two significant developments. First were the reports of two genetically engineered (GE) pig kidneys transplanted into deceased human recipients, mechanically maintained after death by neurological criteria (decedents). 3 4 6][7] This resurgence of activity, in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, comes at a time when public and professional anxieties about zoonoses, public health and experimental treatments are all running high. \n\nIt was on this background that in late 2022 King's College London, with endorsement from the British Transplant Society, and the European Society of Organ Transplantation, brought together a group of experts in xenotransplantation science, ethics and law. This symposium, the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years, aimed to discuss the ethical, regulatory, and technical challenges surrounding translating xenotransplantation into the clinical setting. First, a series of three lectures showcased the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including-the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and preclinical research activities.

Yet, the precise basis of the recipient's death continues to be uncertain and remains under evaluation. 16 The porcine donor in this case had 10 genetic modulations (knock out of three porcine genes that promote hyperacute rejection, knock out of one gene that causes continued organ growth, and six human genes that promote tolerance (rejection reduction) were inserted (knock-in) in the porcine genome. 17 owever, despite these advances and optimism, bioethical issues related to xenotransplantation remain polemic and some issues deserve particular attention. Clinical application of innovation such as xenotransplantation raises questions concerning the balance between beneficence, individual autonomy and the recognition of possible damage to society and the environment. 18,19 The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. 18,19 he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation. 20,21  recipients and their contacts probably will need lifelong surveillance to detect and treat any unexpected disease early and protect society as a whole. 20,21 he appropriate care of the swine that will be a donor in the xenotransplantation is another important bioethical issue.",

Galv\u00e3o, Max B P Grinberg\n## Abstract\nNone\n## body\nAlternatively, a problematic reaction to an intravenous human Immunoglobulin (IVIg) (antibody-mediated rejection drug), or humoral rejection might have contributed to the patient's heart failure. Yet, the precise basis of the recipient's death continues to be uncertain and remains under evaluation. 16 The porcine donor in this case had 10 genetic modulations (knock out of three porcine genes that promote hyperacute rejection, knock out of one gene that causes continued organ growth, and six human genes that promote tolerance (rejection reduction) were inserted (knock-in) in the porcine genome. 17 owever, despite these advances and optimism, bioethical issues related to xenotransplantation remain polemic and some issues deserve particular attention. Clinical application of innovation such as xenotransplantation raises questions concerning the balance between beneficence, individual autonomy and the recognition of possible damage to society and the environment. 18,19 The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. 18,19 he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation. 20,21  recipients and their contacts probably will need lifelong surveillance to detect and treat any unexpected disease early and protect society as a whole. 20,21 he appropriate care of the swine that will be a donor in the xenotransplantation is another important bioethical issue.",

In this article, we first provide an introductory overview of the key legal, ethical and psychosocial considerations identified in the existing literature and identify areas where research is currently lacking. We then highlight two principal areas of concern in which these discrete disciplines significantly overlap: 1) individual autonomy and 2) access and equality. Using the example of beta-cell provenance, we demonstrate how, by harnessing an interdisciplinary approach we can address these key areas of concern. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations to researchers, clinicians, and policymakers which will help to facilitate the clinical translation of this cutting-edge technology for Type 1 Diabetes patients. Finally, we emphasize the importance of exploring patient perspectives to ensure their responsible and acceptable translation from bench to body.",

In this article, we first provide an introductory overview of the key legal, ethical and psychosocial considerations identified in the existing literature and identify areas where research is currently lacking. We then highlight two principal areas of concern in which these discrete disciplines significantly overlap: 1) individual autonomy and 2) access and equality. Using the example of beta-cell provenance, we demonstrate how, by harnessing an interdisciplinary approach we can address these key areas of concern. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations to researchers, clinicians, and policymakers which will help to facilitate the clinical translation of this cutting-edge technology for Type 1 Diabetes patients. Finally, we emphasize the importance of exploring patient perspectives to ensure their responsible and acceptable translation from bench to body.\n## Xenogeneic Cells\nCells derived from genetically modified animal (namely, porcine) sources have been suggested as alternatives. However, the use of xenogeneic cells raises even more challenging potential psychosocial and ethical barriers leading to varying legal approaches. These include moral concerns for animal rights and welfare, religious beliefs [51,55] and the risks for wider society, particularly that of zoonosis [51,56]. The EU has issued guidelines for an approach to the medicinal use of animal cells [57]. However, due to the culturally sensitive nature of this topic the overall permissibility of xenotransplantation is a matter devolved to individual member states. Despite centralized recommendations, markedly different approaches have been",

Despite its potential in science, organoid technology poses complex ethical challenges that may hinder any future benefits for patients and society. This study aims to analyze the multifaceted ethical issues raised by organoids and recommend measures that must be taken at various levels to ensure the ethical use and application of this technology. Organoid technology raises several serious ethics issues related to the source of stem cells for organoid creation, informed consent and privacy of cell donors, the moral and legal status of organoids, the potential acquisition of human \u201ccharacteristics or qualities\u201d, use of gene editing, creation of chimeras, organoid transplantation, commercialization and patentability, issues of equity in the resulting treatments, potential misuse and dual use issues and long-term storage in biobanks. Existing guidelines and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to organoids are also discussed. It is concluded that despite the serious ethical challenges posed by organoid use and biobanking, we have a moral obligation to support organoid research and ensure that we do not lose any of the potential benefits that organoids offer. In this direction, a four-step approach is recommended, which includes existing regulations and guidelines, special regulatory provisions that may be needed, public engagement and continuous monitoring of the rapid advancements in the field. This approach may help maximize the biomedical and social benefits of organoid technology and contribute to future governance models in organoid technology.",

In view of that, the risk of therapeutic misconception must be taken into consideration during the informed consent procedure and ensure that participants in the trial fully understand the true benefits of research. \n\nSome scientists have even raised the question about whether it is ethically acceptable to include children in a first-in-human organoid transplantation clinical trial and under which conditions. Of course, these would be children who suffer from severe conditions that predominantly affect children, such as metabolic diseases [41]. In such cases, additional ethical concerns should be considered including the principle of subsidiarity, which demands that clinical research involving children is only permissible if the clinical study cannot be performed in adults. Such first-in-children clinical trial for liver organoid transplantation could be ethically justified provided that certain guidelines are followed and various safeguards are met [41]. \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that organoid transplantation may offer an alternative to xenotransplantation [42]. Xenotransplantation is the transplantation, implantation or infusion of living cells, tissues or whole organs from animals to humans and has been examined as a possible solution to the scarcity of human organ donors, to the illegal trade of organs from living donors and the use of condemned prisoners as donors, which is permitted in some countries. It involves genetic modification of animals (e.g., pigs and non-human primates) so that their organs cause a reduced immune response when transplanted into humans, raising arguments on the welfare of the donor animals. In addition, xenotransplantation encompasses serious safety issues, because of the possibility to transmit infectious agents from animals to human recipients threatening the recipient's health but also public health. Perhaps more importantly, transplanting animal organs into humans raises concerns over whether this changes the human nature of the recipient and whether it violates the integrity of the human species. These issues result in reduced societal acceptability of xenotransplantation.",

Organoid technology raises several serious ethics issues related to the source of stem cells for organoid creation, informed consent and privacy of cell donors, the moral and legal status of organoids, the potential acquisition of human \u201ccharacteristics or qualities\u201d, use of gene editing, creation of chimeras, organoid transplantation, commercialization and patentability, issues of equity in the resulting treatments, potential misuse and dual use issues and long-term storage in biobanks. Existing guidelines and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to organoids are also discussed. It is concluded that despite the serious ethical challenges posed by organoid use and biobanking, we have a moral obligation to support organoid research and ensure that we do not lose any of the potential benefits that organoids offer. In this direction, a four-step approach is recommended, which includes existing regulations and guidelines, special regulatory provisions that may be needed, public engagement and continuous monitoring of the rapid advancements in the field. This approach may help maximize the biomedical and social benefits of organoid technology and contribute to future governance models in organoid technology.\n## Organoid Transplantation\nTherefore, it contains the risk of the so-called \"therapeutic misconception\", a phenomenon during which the study participants have no other available therapeutic options and believe that they will be personally benefited therapeutically by the clinical trial rather than they will help to generate knowledge and advance the science for certain diseases [40]. In view of that, the risk of therapeutic misconception must be taken into consideration during the informed consent procedure and ensure that participants in the trial fully understand the true benefits of research. \n\nSome scientists have even raised the question about whether it is ethically acceptable to include children in a first-in-human organoid transplantation clinical trial and under which conditions. Of course, these would be children who suffer from severe conditions that predominantly affect children, such as metabolic diseases [41]. In such cases, additional ethical concerns should be considered including the principle of subsidiarity, which demands that clinical research involving children is only permissible if the clinical study cannot be performed in adults. Such first-in-children clinical trial for liver organoid transplantation could be ethically justified provided that certain guidelines are followed and various safeguards are met [41]. \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that organoid transplantation may offer an alternative to xenotransplantation [42]. Xenotransplantation is the transplantation, implantation or infusion of living cells, tissues or whole organs from animals to humans and has been examined as a possible solution to the scarcity of human organ donors, to the illegal trade of organs from living donors and the use of condemned prisoners as donors, which is permitted in some countries. It involves genetic modification of animals (e.g., pigs and non-human primates) so that their organs cause a reduced immune response when transplanted into humans, raising arguments on the welfare of the donor animals. In addition, xenotransplantation encompasses serious safety issues, because of the possibility to transmit infectious agents from animals to human recipients threatening the recipient's health but also public health. Perhaps more importantly, transplanting animal organs into humans raises concerns over whether this changes the human nature of the recipient and whether it violates the integrity of the human species. These issues result in reduced societal acceptability of xenotransplantation.",

In this review, we comprehensively discuss the potential applications of both human and pig PSCs and provide an overview of the current progress and challenges in this field. In addition to exploring the therapeutic uses of PSC-derived cellular products, we also shed light on their significance in the study of interspecies chimeras, which has led to the creation of transplantable human or humanized pig organs. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of pig PSCs as an ideal cell source for genetic engineering, facilitating the development of genetically modified pigs for pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Despite the achievements that have been made, further investigations and refinement of PSC technologies are necessary to unlock their full potential in regenerative medicine and effectively address critical healthcare challenges.",

This simple argument is, however, not a valid argument for xenotransplantation, as the research touches on many more ethical aspects. Therefore, xenotransplantation research is accompanied by ethical research to evaluate the perception of the different ethical groups regarding the use of pig organs. Pioneering work has been established by the German xenotransplantation consortium. In a survey of representative citizens, the group considered the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks but called for strict regulatory measures [89]. Despite animals having been used in scientific research for a long time, the main ongoing concern is the welfare of these animals, ensuring that they live well, feel well, and function well [90]. Therefore, when manipulating the pig genome to create humanized pigs for xenotransplantation, it is essential to carefully assess gene modifications to avoid harming the animals' physical and mental health. \n\nWhen employing human PSCs for human-pig chimeras or directly utilizing humanized pig organs for regenerative medicine, we need to avoid human PSCs contributing to the neurons and germ cells. Efforts could be made to specifically eliminate the donor cell contribution in the brain in interspecies chimera [91]. Such scientific advances are expected to help circumvent the contribution of human cells to the pig brain or germ cells. \n\nAgain, the main argument for an overall positive assessment of stem cell research in general and xenotransplantation in particular in the societal context is primarily based on the societal obligation to help people with life-threatening conditions and to alleviate suffering where possible. The fact that research is well ahead of the public consciousness and that a broader societal debate is necessary and still lacking demands ongoing evaluation and regulation to ensure the responsible and safe implementation of using stem cell-and pig-related products in research and medicine. These research activities, including the generation of gene-edited pigs, must have ethical approval by an independent commission and abide by the local and international regulations.",

Petersen, Pentao Liu\n## Abstract\nPluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are important for studying development and hold great promise in regenerative medicine due to their ability to differentiate into various cell types. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the potential applications of both human and pig PSCs and provide an overview of the current progress and challenges in this field. In addition to exploring the therapeutic uses of PSC-derived cellular products, we also shed light on their significance in the study of interspecies chimeras, which has led to the creation of transplantable human or humanized pig organs. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of pig PSCs as an ideal cell source for genetic engineering, facilitating the development of genetically modified pigs for pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Despite the achievements that have been made, further investigations and refinement of PSC technologies are necessary to unlock their full potential in regenerative medicine and effectively address critical healthcare challenges.\n## Ethics and Other Concerns\nThere is a higher social acceptance of pig-related products for therapeutic purposesthey have a long history of domestication as livestock and serve as an important food source for human beings. This simple argument is, however, not a valid argument for xenotransplantation, as the research touches on many more ethical aspects. Therefore, xenotransplantation research is accompanied by ethical research to evaluate the perception of the different ethical groups regarding the use of pig organs. Pioneering work has been established by the German xenotransplantation consortium. In a survey of representative citizens, the group considered the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks but called for strict regulatory measures [89]. Despite animals having been used in scientific research for a long time, the main ongoing concern is the welfare of these animals, ensuring that they live well, feel well, and function well [90]. Therefore, when manipulating the pig genome to create humanized pigs for xenotransplantation, it is essential to carefully assess gene modifications to avoid harming the animals' physical and mental health. \n\nWhen employing human PSCs for human-pig chimeras or directly utilizing humanized pig organs for regenerative medicine, we need to avoid human PSCs contributing to the neurons and germ cells. Efforts could be made to specifically eliminate the donor cell contribution in the brain in interspecies chimera [91]. Such scientific advances are expected to help circumvent the contribution of human cells to the pig brain or germ cells. \n\nAgain, the main argument for an overall positive assessment of stem cell research in general and xenotransplantation in particular in the societal context is primarily based on the societal obligation to help people with life-threatening conditions and to alleviate suffering where possible. The fact that research is well ahead of the public consciousness and that a broader societal debate is necessary and still lacking demands ongoing evaluation and regulation to ensure the responsible and safe implementation of using stem cell-and pig-related products in research and medicine. These research activities, including the generation of gene-edited pigs, must have ethical approval by an independent commission and abide by the local and international regulations.",

Among all, microinjection of foreign DNA into newly fertilized eggs has been the predominant method used for the generation of transgenic livestock over the past 20 years. The following concerns are important as for as animal welfare is concerned: \n\nC The technology is a lab level and for commercialization of the techniques large number of animals may be exposed for the adaptability and trials 11,33,34,35 C Technique results in random integration and variable expression levels of the target gene in the transgenic offspring. This poorly controlled expression of the introduced gene can result in animal welfare concerns. For example, various growth abnormalities have been observed in genetically engineered animals expressing growth hormone transgenes at varying levels 36,37 C Animal welfare concerns may also be associated with the breeding objectives underlying the reasons behind making a given genetically engineered animal. For example, if genetic engineering makes farm animals more productive, this may have the effect of boosting productivity to a level that results in a welfare concern. This concern depends upon the effect of the specific transgene that is being investigated and is not a concern that is unique to genetic engineering. Any genetic improvement program directed exclusively towards high production efficiency has the potential to cause animal welfare concerns, irrespective of the techniques used to obtain that goal 38 C There are two central ethical concerns associated with the genetic engineering of animals. The first has to do with breaching species barriers or playing God. Proponents of this view suggest that life should not be regarded solely as if it were a chemical product subject to genetic alteration and patent able for economic benefit. The second major ethical concern is that the genetic engineering of animals interferes with the integrity or telos of the animal. \n\nTelos is defined as \"the set of needs and interests which are genetically based and environmentally expressed and which collectively constitute or define the form of life or way of living exhibited by that animal and whose fulfillment or thwarting matter to that animal\" 39",

Sachan\n## Abstract\nBackground: Genetically engineering is an integral approach to the development of new diagnostic techniques, drugs for human and animal diseases, foods for human health, development of tissues and cells for xenotransplantation. The components of vaccine for disease control and nutraceuticals for human health by altering the food components or by introducing the health provide proteins, peptides and other components may be the integral part of human life in coming days. Genetically engineered animals also offer significant human health and environmental benefits, livestock becomes more efficient for converting feed to animal protein and reducing waste production. Finally, genetic engineering will improve the welfare of animals by imparting resistance to disease and enhancing overall health and well being. Objective: This study reviews the basics of genetic engineering and their scope in various fields of life. Conclusion: The need is to commercialize the technology by the authentication on science based formulations. The judicial approaches and validation of the technologies by removing the myths related to the technology are some other issues must be handled properly.\n## GENETICALLY ENGINEERED (GE) ANIMALS AND ANIMAL WELFARE WITH SPECIAL CONCERN OF ETHICAL ISSUES\nA variety of techniques have been used produce transgenic livestock with varying degrees of success. Among all, microinjection of foreign DNA into newly fertilized eggs has been the predominant method used for the generation of transgenic livestock over the past 20 years. The following concerns are important as for as animal welfare is concerned: \n\nC The technology is a lab level and for commercialization of the techniques large number of animals may be exposed for the adaptability and trials 11,33,34,35 C Technique results in random integration and variable expression levels of the target gene in the transgenic offspring. This poorly controlled expression of the introduced gene can result in animal welfare concerns. For example, various growth abnormalities have been observed in genetically engineered animals expressing growth hormone transgenes at varying levels 36,37 C Animal welfare concerns may also be associated with the breeding objectives underlying the reasons behind making a given genetically engineered animal. For example, if genetic engineering makes farm animals more productive, this may have the effect of boosting productivity to a level that results in a welfare concern. This concern depends upon the effect of the specific transgene that is being investigated and is not a concern that is unique to genetic engineering. Any genetic improvement program directed exclusively towards high production efficiency has the potential to cause animal welfare concerns, irrespective of the techniques used to obtain that goal 38 C There are two central ethical concerns associated with the genetic engineering of animals. The first has to do with breaching species barriers or playing God. Proponents of this view suggest that life should not be regarded solely as if it were a chemical product subject to genetic alteration and patent able for economic benefit. The second major ethical concern is that the genetic engineering of animals interferes with the integrity or telos of the animal. \n\nTelos is defined as \"the set of needs and interests which are genetically based and environmentally expressed and which collectively constitute or define the form of life or way of living exhibited by that animal and whose fulfillment or thwarting matter to that animal\" 39",

Historically, ten attempts to transplant animal hearts into human recipients have been reported. Those who received hearts from nonhuman primates (i.e., baboons and chimpanzees) survived rather longer than did those who received hearts from nonprimates (i.e., sheep and pigs). Nevertheless, current opinion is that the pig is the best candidate as a source of hearts for humans despite the considerable immunologic disparity between the two species. Pigs are available in large numbers and can be bred easily and rapidly. They grow to appropriate sizes and their cardiovascular system is similar to that of humans. Substantial knowledge has been accumulated regarding both genetic engineering and tolerance induction in pigs, two strategies that may help to overcome the existing immunologic barriers. Concern has been raised, however, with regard to the potential for the transfer of a porcine infection with the pig organ to the human recipient. This brief review addresses these and other aspects of the use of the pig as a source of hearts for patients with end\u2010stage cardiac disease.",

Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is important that certain guidelines are established. The transgenic pigs that have already been developed express small amounts of human protein (e.g., hDAF). Although these animals continue to be very much pigs, some have argued that, with each addition of a human gene to the pig genome, the animal becomes more \"humanized\".\n\nThe extent to which the pigs genome can be manipulated such that the animal maintains its identity as a pig is difficult to define and is a mat-ter of debate.

Cooper\n## Abstract\nThe inadequate availability of human donor hearts and other organs has inspired interest in the field of xenotransplantation. Historically, ten attempts to transplant animal hearts into human recipients have been reported. Those who received hearts from nonhuman primates (i.e., baboons and chimpanzees) survived rather longer than did those who received hearts from nonprimates (i.e., sheep and pigs). Nevertheless, current opinion is that the pig is the best candidate as a source of hearts for humans despite the considerable immunologic disparity between the two species. Pigs are available in large numbers and can be bred easily and rapidly. They grow to appropriate sizes and their cardiovascular system is similar to that of humans. Substantial knowledge has been accumulated regarding both genetic engineering and tolerance induction in pigs, two strategies that may help to overcome the existing immunologic barriers. Concern has been raised, however, with regard to the potential for the transfer of a porcine infection with the pig organ to the human recipient. This brief review addresses these and other aspects of the use of the pig as a source of hearts for patients with end\u2010stage cardiac disease.\n## Moral and ethical issues\nare taken from the source pig and human recipient for storage for later study if necessary. Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is important that certain guidelines are established. The transgenic pigs that have already been developed express small amounts of human protein (e.g., hDAF). Although these animals continue to be very much pigs, some have argued that, with each addition of a human gene to the pig genome, the animal becomes more \"humanized\".\n\nThe extent to which the pigs genome can be manipulated such that the animal maintains its identity as a pig is difficult to define and is a mat-ter of debate. The UK Advisory Group on the Ethics of Xenotransplantation concluded that \"some degree of genetic modification is ethically acceptable\" but that \"there are limits to the extent to which an animal should be genetically modified\".79 Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the group stated that pigs should not be \"genetically manipulated beyond a point that w e would regard as intolerable to the animal (a moral point of view, concerned with the 'pigness' of pigs, which comes a point where the pig is no longer a pig and which might be deemed offensive to all).\" Indeed, the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human as well as pig characteristics, if conceivable, would certainly be unethical and should not be attempted.

            "text": "Simple Summary The dream of transferring bodily organs from animals to humans goes back to antiquity, as articulated in the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",

Public perception of the ethics surrounding xenotransplantation can significantly influence its acceptance and, consequently, the regulatory environment. As such there has been significant engagement with both societal and religious organizations to ensure robust understanding of the key concepts and garner opinion and support (6,35,36). \n\nThe IXA has endeavored to undertake public engagement with ongoing dialogue which are essential to fostering trust with transparency and acceptance. It is incumbent on the broader scientific community and policymakers to communicate the steps taken to mitigate ethical concerns and to provide evidence of the rigorous ethical oversight and animal welfare standards applied in xenotransplantation research. Furthermore the governing organization of xenotransplantation the IXA is maintaining its mission to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality by; fostering the science of xenotransplantation through promotion of ethical clinical and pre-clinical research, productive discourse, and collaboration; along with further educating health care providers and lay persons through broad, representative participation interactive public debate; and also guiding the development of scientifically sound, internationally consistent public policy that is responsive to new developments in the field and acknowledges varying social, ethical and legal frameworks (37). Along with ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and other agencies to ensure they balance the advancement of science but safeguarding the ethical principles. This is actively being undertaken with a strong push from the IXA to engage numerous agencies globally to ensure this continues to occur and keep pace with the rapidly developing technologies (8).",

            "text": "However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic. With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.",

            "text": "Other concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14].

            "text": "In our eagerness to press on toward new territories in medicine, it is important to consider the moral and ethical aspects of any new therapeutic approach. With regard to xenotransplantation, several issues must be considered and, indeed, have been previously reviewed by several aut h o r~.~~-*~ As in many other attempts to take great leaps in medicine, the moral and ethical views of the general public may differ from those in the medical field. Indeed, therapeutic xenotransplantation has the potential to evoke a great deal of controversy. Thus, public opinion must be carefully considered since, if antagonistic, it has the potential to prevent clinical implementation. Ethical concerns include those relating to animal welfare and animal rights, as well as the rights of the individual patient and of the community. Particular aspects that require consideration include the appropriate timing of the initial clinical trial of cardiac xenotransplantation, the selection of the first patients, and the abilityto obtain fully-informed consent from them and their families.\n\nPerhaps because approximately 100 million pigs are slain each year in the United States for food,84 research using pigs evokes less public opposition than that using nonhuman primates or even dogs. This, coupled with the fact that pig heart valves have been used therapeutically in the medical arena for several years, suggests that there may be general public acceptance to the use of pigs as a source of organs.\n\nThe major ethical concern is probably the potential risk of infection to the population at large. Before clinical trials proceed, sufficient evidence must be gathered to ensure that the welfare of the community is not jeopardized for the sake of what will initially be a very small number of sick patients. The anticipated benefit to the patient must be carefully weighed against the potential risk to the community. It is this potential risk to the community that mandates that all clinical trials are carried out under the authority of a body or organization which has powers to allow or discontinue the trial, and ensure that the necessary specimens are taken from the source pig and human recipient for storage for later study if necessary. Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is",

            "text": "Apart from this, there are a lot many unknown viruses that are hosted by animal species whose effects are not at all predictable [117]. Hence, the recipient should also be informed about the risks and preventions that he/she must take posttransplantation, restricting his freedom [121,122]. Further, to increase the success rate of transplants, recipients are constantly under the influence of immunosuppressant drugs, which would enhance his chances of other infections [117]. However, immunological reactions are not reported much after using dECM 3D bioprinted constructs. Additionally, one has to justify whether the amount that is being spent on xenotransplantation research for translation to clinical level is really worth, as it can help a relatively smaller group of people. Furthermore, for animal welfare, there are animal-related ethical issues which are considered important similar to human ethical issues [123]. Some groups believe that, the use of animals to fulfill human needs is strongly unethical, while few accept that if the benefits surpass the degree of suffering of animals, then there is no harm to use animal organs for saving human life [124]. Almost all the vertebrates suffer and perceive pain in a similar way [121]. Producing transgenic animals for organ transplantation also received criticism, as during this process, much more pain and suffering is imposed on animals due to multiple experiments in succession. In order to reduce the chance of viral transmissions, these transgenic animals are quarantined and kept in isolation [121]. Hence, the supports for animal welfare argue that the animals that undergo genetic engineering technique will be deprived of its natural habitat and are forced to live in a secluded place with pain and agony [117]. Will this suffering of an animal be the guarantee that its organ is successfully put into use remains as an unanswered question. Apart from ethics, religious feelings also come into play. A pig that is considered to have similar genetic and physiological traits similar to human [125] is considered unclean in many religions but is considered as a versatile model in biomedical research. On the other hand, if the benefits and safety of xenotransplantation is proven for human well-being, dealing with animal ethics could be vindicated.",

Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage. In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare. [12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization. \n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]",

And, as we know from the rise of industrial agriculture and the history of animal research, human benefit usually wins. \n\nThe template I have just outlined works very well for all aspects of biotechnology including agriculture, animal research, creation of animal models of human genetic disease, and the topic at hand, xenotransplantation. In fact, xenotransplantation provides a textbook example of all of the above categories. Approximately 3500 to 4000 people seek heart transplants per year in the U.S. As a result, alternatives to human donors have been sought. One putatively plausible alternative has been to use animals, specifically pigs, although historically baboons and other animals have been utilized. There are no cases reported of humans surviving with pig hearts. \n\nConsider the use of pig hearts for people needing heart transplants. (This is overwhelmingly the primary use of xenotransplantation that has been discussed.) There exist very real dangers in using animal organs for transplantation, specifically on microbiological, physiological, and immunological levels. There are also animal welfare issues associated with such uses, albeit subtle ones. Finally, there are extremely clear examples of bad ethics supplanting and eclipsing good ethics in discussions of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation necessitates the use of animals as organ donors. Pigs being primarily used due to their physiological compatibility with humans, their ability to be bred in large numbers at a rapid rate, and their ability to be readily genetically altered. This along with their longstanding acceptance as a source of medical products such as drugs and heart valves and other decellularized tissues. With by far the strongest reason being there acceptance as a major food supply and source of products for man for as long as they have been domesticated should ensure their ease of use ethically (6). However, the welfare of these animals is of paramount concern. As some organizations push the principal that pigs are not merely commodities but sentient beings with the capacity to experience pain and suffering. \n\nThe major issues raised are to ensure the donor pigs are being ethically and humanely cared for and ensure the process of genetic manipulation does not cause them any health issues. One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6). \n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4).",

While there is a high demand for human tissues, cells, and organs for use in clinical transplantation, they are often in short supply. Recent scientific and biotechnological advancements, coupled with the scarcity of human allografts, have led to renewed interest in developing exploratory treatment strategies that use xenotransplantation products in human recipients. However, despite its potential benefits, the use of xenotransplantation is still limited due to various considerations, as discussed in this review of the past, present, and future directions of xenotransplantation. One of the key ethical concerns surrounding xenotransplantation is the potential impact on the animals from which the cells, tissues, or organs are obtained. As with genetic modification to fix genetic defects or prevent disease, the ideal outcome for these animals is that they will be better off as a result of the change. However, unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed",

It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6). \n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6).",

Bach, an authority on xenotransplantation at Harvard Medical School, opined that helping individuals relieve pain was an adequate justification for the risk to the public, which was known to exist but could not be quantified at the time.The consensus was that xenotransplantation is ultimately an ethical issue rather than a technical one [11].At about that time, many countries around the world began to consider the ethical governance and legal issues around xenotransplantation.\n\nChina was late in starting xenotransplantation research.Some medical universities have performed xenotransplantation in animal models and have carried out related preclinical research.Some of these studies have been supported by major national projects in China.The number of articles on preclinical studies of xenotransplantation published in the journal China Organ Transplantation is increasing each year, as is the number of articles on xenotransplantation considered at the annual National Organ Transplantation Academic Conference.Nevertheless, ethical issues are hardly discussed.",

            "text": "A variety of techniques have been used produce transgenic livestock with varying degrees of success. Among all, microinjection of foreign DNA into newly fertilized eggs has been the predominant method used for the generation of transgenic livestock over the past 20 years. The following concerns are important as for as animal welfare is concerned: \n\nC The technology is a lab level and for commercialization of the techniques large number of animals may be exposed for the adaptability and trials 11,33,34,35 C Technique results in random integration and variable expression levels of the target gene in the transgenic offspring. This poorly controlled expression of the introduced gene can result in animal welfare concerns. For example, various growth abnormalities have been observed in genetically engineered animals expressing growth hormone transgenes at varying levels 36,37 C Animal welfare concerns may also be associated with the breeding objectives underlying the reasons behind making a given genetically engineered animal. For example, if genetic engineering makes farm animals more productive, this may have the effect of boosting productivity to a level that results in a welfare concern. This concern depends upon the effect of the specific transgene that is being investigated and is not a concern that is unique to genetic engineering. Any genetic improvement program directed exclusively towards high production efficiency has the potential to cause animal welfare concerns, irrespective of the techniques used to obtain that goal 38 C There are two central ethical concerns associated with the genetic engineering of animals. The first has to do with breaching species barriers or playing God. Proponents of this view suggest that life should not be regarded solely as if it were a chemical product subject to genetic alteration and patent able for economic benefit. The second major ethical concern is that the genetic engineering of animals interferes with the integrity or telos of the animal. \n\nTelos is defined as \"the set of needs and interests which are genetically based and environmentally expressed and which collectively constitute or define the form of life or way of living exhibited by that animal and whose fulfillment or thwarting matter to that animal\" 39",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is fraught with numerous ethical and social dilemmas, encompassing substantial costs and resource allocations essential for the research endeavor. Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

            "text": "For example, a member of the xenotransplantation team outlined the \"ethical algorithm\" at use during the xenoheart's development and eventual transplant. The clinician-scientist in question, Martine Rothblatt 28 , reassured readers in a commentary published in Xenotransplantation that a balance was struck between the \"public's concern not to face a new pandemic\" with the \"patient's concern not to die from their disease.\" The ethical dilemma, as perceived by the xenotransplantation team, was primarily concerned with how to \"comply with infection control procedures,\" diminish the \"possibility of transmissible pathogens,\" a \"commitment to biosurveillance,\" and \"humane care practices\" 28 for the donor pigs. In other words, an ethical algorithm that intended to balance the desire to break new grounds in xenotransplantation science with the all-too-real fear of zoonotic spillover. It should come as no surprise that many of the ethical considerations at the forefront of the biomedical team are, in a sense, deeply rooted in pragmatic scientific considerations. \n\nThe immunological response has been one of the most significant stumbling blocks for replacing solid organ transplantation with xenotransplantation. Current studies often utilize genetically modified porcine donor organs that lack the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (\"alpha Gal\"), which is thought to prevent hyperacute rejection of the transplanted non-human organ as well as acute vascular rejection events 34 . However, it is not just the knockout of alpha-Gal which may need to occur to prevent rejection. Some studies are exploring the combined effect of alpha-Gal knockouts and randomly inserted human alpha 1,2-fucosylosyltransferase (HT) transgene in the hopes that the addition of the human HT gene will produce better results than just the null porcine line 34 . These alterations and research lines refer to the porcine donor's genetic makeup. This work does not touch on the pharmaceutical course and immunological therapies that need to be developed or altered to prepare human and animal donors for transplantation.",

This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.",

Unfortunately, this colossal achievement of human progress has a problematic side \u2013 the shortage of donor organs. The use of animal organs could solve it. Currently, the issues of xenotransplantation have become relevant again after the experimental xenotransplantation of the kidney of a genetically modified pig in 2021, and the xenotransplantation of the heart in 2022. This practice raises a number of ethical questions. Is it ethical to put humanity at risk by saving one person? Is it ethical to limit the civil rights of a xeno-recipient? Will xenotransplantation create another reason for discrimination? Can the creation of xenochimeras be considered an unacceptable interference in the Divine plan from a religious point of view? Is it ethical to use higher animals for xenotransplantation? Will an increase in the number of xenotransplants create a risk of the identity of the human race? Will xenotransplantation create new questions about equitable organ allocation? The sources of scholars of theologians related to the main Abrahamic religions on this topic are analyzed. Consideration of theological approaches to the new ethical problems presented by xenotransplantation does not allow us to find a unanimity of opinion. However, as this new branch of medical science makes concrete clinical progress, the attitude of society, religious leaders and ordinary believers towards it will improve. From an individual point of view, Judaism does not object to xenotransplantation to prolong and save human life, even in the case of non-kosher animals with genetic modifications. The preservation of life outweighs other values almost without exception. Xenotransplantation, even from a pig, is hailed as a life-sustaining medical intervention from a Jewish ethical perspective by most authors. In Christianity, the motivation is to try to follow the example of Jesus Christ in bringing healing to all those in need. While physiological healing is important, the ultimate goal is the overall well-being of the individual, which requires spiritual, mental, and social well-being in addition to physical health. The most correct generalization about Islamic bioethical views on xenotransplantation would be that, given the state",

Here, we present a brief summary of considerations put to discussion for almost 70 years, related to the limits of \"doing good\" by avoiding harm to others. \n\nRegarding living donor organ donation, the safety of healthy people is a big concern where a balance between risk to the donor and the high possibility of a successful transplant must be taken into account [126]. Other topics under discussion are: if the altruist donor freely makes his/her decision; the possibility of receiving a reimbursement; or if it is acceptable to use hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected organs for uninfected recipients [127,128]. \n\nAlthough living donors can donate part of their liver, the shortage of organs is still a big concern. Xenotransplantation as an alternative, but brings new challenges. Clearly, this option is even more risky than orthotopic transplantation due to the high possibility of rejection and the potential emergence of a new virus and even worse, of a pandemic. However, the use of genetically modified animals in the attempt to reduce rejection rates is not exempt from ethical discussion [129,130]. In order to avoid rejection, it is possible to develop a \"humanized organ\" inside animals for later transplantation. In this case, the ethical concerns refer to the possibility, quite unlikely, of introducing human DNA into an animal embryo, and thereby compromising human dignity. \n\nAn emerging ethical concern while xenotransplantation is under experimental research is that once this procedure is established, the production of animals for this purpose, basically pigs, will be discussed in the context of life-saving benefits versus the use of animals for meat consumption. Undoubtedly, many ethical issues will be raised in the process of minimizing the risk of spreading zoonosis to humans, because everyone close to the recipient may well be subject to long-term observation, affecting their rights to privacy and confidentiality.",

While HAR has been alleviated owing to gene-editing technologies, DXR and chronic rejection remain urgent issues to be solved. Another concern focuses on PERVs transmission, which is a major hurdle to the clinical use of pig cells, tissues, and organs for treatment of organ failure in humans. However, it is still uncertain whether PERVs is pathogenic to humans, or if it could recombine with hERVs to form new viruses. Genetic engineering techniques such as CRIPSR/Cas9 genome editing system could prevent their activation or delete them from the pig cells (245,246). Further, the ethical issues around xenotransplantation have not been sufficiently discussed. Strict medical and ethical guidelines and regulations are needed before clinical applications can be tried on selected patients. Beyond the common ethical and technical issues shared by the different areas of xenotransplantation, there are also organ-specific barriers that are briefly addressed below.",

            "text": "Organ transplantation raises numerous ethical issues. Even transplanting kidneys from deceased human donors with their prior consent can raise some ethical concerns. For example, we may wonder about the conditions under which their consent is secured, or question a definition of death [1,2]; we may find the content and consequences of their consent objectionable, as when racist donors agree to transplants provided priority is given to members of their own race when distributing their organs [3]; or we may object to transplants of certain organs, such as wombs, because of the possible effects on third parties, such as the baby growing with immunosuppressants [4]. \n\nIn cases of xenotransplantation, when the donor and the recipient belong to different species, further issues arise, regarding (i) the unavoidable harms to the donor and (ii) the possible harms to the recipients. When the donor is a chimeric pig, designed to contain a percentage of human genes and cells, xenotransplantation provokes two opposing sets of reactions [5]. \n\nFor some, the use of human-pig chimeras strengthens both recipient-based and donor-based objections, rendering xenotransplantation more objectionable or even impermissible. Many feel an aversion to such a deep transgression of the natural order, for reasons that may be theological, ecological, or involve human dignity, animal rights or fear of scientists yet again producing undesirable, unforeseen, and irreversible consequences. Others have more specific concerns. For example, the US National Institutes of Health suspended funding of their chimeric xenotransplantation program in 2015 over concerns about introducing human DNA into a member of another species, and particularly doing so at such an early developmental stage. As Carrie Wolinetz, Salz Institute's Associate Director for Science Policy, explains: 'people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal' [6]. In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild.",

This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation marks a qualitatively new challenge in medical technology assessment. The reasons for this claim are twofold: (i) in contrast to more traditional medical interventions, xenotransplantation involves risks not only to the patient, but also to larger segments of society, thus to public health in general. (ii) while most medical technologies demand assessment and risk-management at the time when the technology is sufficiently developed to be put into practice, xenotransplantation demands pro-active action at a very early stage of development. A particular challenge for any assessment of xenotransplantation is the inclusion of a satisfactory approach to the ethical issues involved. In itself this is, of course, not particular/unique to xenotransplantation, as most medical interventions need a good consideration of ethics. But seen in connection with the two characteristics mentioned above, this amounts to a truly formidable task. Given that discussions about xenotransplantation are rather recent, and given that a real scientific development is \u2013 luckily I am inclined to say \u2013 still pending and assumedly not to be expected for several years to come, it is not surprising that the debate about the ethics involved is still very tentative. Several academic papers and several government reports from a variety of countries do indeed deal with the ethical issues of xenotransplantation. But it is, as far as I can see, still too early to say that a general consensus has been reached about what precisely the ethical issues are, and, more importantly, how best to deal with them. What is important, though, is that the discussion about ethics in xenotransplantation has started, and that it follows the medical-scientific advances very closely. This is in itself a consoling reminder that ethical awareness in modern societies is coming more and more to the fore front of public debate, and that ethics is put on the agenda, including the political agenda, like never before. In this paper I shall leave out a number of ethical issues that need to be dealt with if the ethical assessment is to be comprehensive. These are e.g. issues concerning animal welfare and ethics, issues concerning standard medical ethics about how to prepare patients for serious medical interventions, or issues concerning what could be considered a equitable distribution of scarce",

In Korea, the xenotransplantation research began at 2002.

We received 40 responses and analyzed the data.\nThis survey showed that all of the respondents answered that xenotransplantation research is ethically legitimate. But 'very much legitimate'(43.6%) is little lower than 'some legitimate'(56.4%).\nIn related to the ethics of animal experiments, this survey showed some meaningful results: the establishment of Animal Experiment Committee, the need to regular education about animal experiment guideline, the need and justness of transgenic animal and primates recipients etc.\nIn relation to the clinical trial, this survey showed the researchers are very prudent and cautious. They agree to clinical test after 90% safety guaranteed in animal experiments. But they show a favourable response to xenotransplantation if the safety and effectiveness of xenotransplantation is guaranteed.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation from a veterinary and a faith perspective is full of \"what ifs\" and \"what next\" contemplations. In the Anglican Communion, of which the Episcopal Church is part, there has been no consensus as to whether to allow or disallow the use of xenotransplantation to save a human life [42][43][44]. \n\nThe veterinary profession has been integral in the development of transplantation and xenotransplantation technology, not only through its focus on the care of research animals but also an active role in the research of the technologies used in both allo-and xenotransplantation. For many decades, many hearts of Episcopalians and veterinarians have beat with pig or cow valves in place. Editorials on xenotransplantation from Anglican theologians generally do not mention this established technology. The more serious review seems to have happened when research started to focus on solid organ transplant, using genetic manipulation to reduce transplant rejection. So, while there has been no formal declaration concerning the use of animal organs for human use, there are a few scenarios that are likely to play a role for the individual for whom it is offered (and their families). \n\nAnglicans are very committed to creating care, which includes animal welfare, including animals used for meat production or medical research. Given that the donor animal has been genetically modified and needs to be as close to gnotobiotic as feasible for the life of the animal, the care and welfare of the animal needs to be high. Since it is the pig, that is, the animal being used for this research, the physical care and mental health care of the animal are not inconsequential in terms of space, time, and other resources. The second part is when the animal's life is ended, the disposal of the remains, which potentially contain the human genome, becomes not only a biohazard assessment but also creates a question of how one mentally and spiritually addresses the disposal of the human genetic material. Historically, many Christian people would have a prayer service for an amputated limb which was then buried. This is not an understanding that the material, whether incorporated into a pig's genome or a human limb, is a human being.",

            "text": "Likewise, secularization in most contexts (including Egypt) has been associated with higher educational [83][84][85] and socio-economic levels [86,87]. However, in this study, neither of those variables predict moral approval of xenotransplantation. \n\nIt is important to consider that, while religious identity is a factor in predicting the moral approval of xenotransplantation, attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) are also a factor, albeit in a lower capacity. Indeed, as per the regression model of this study, greater attitudes of respect towards animals predict lower moral approval of xenotransplantation. This is expected, as the prospect of xenotransplantation raises concern about the welfare of animals. The genetic modification of animals for xenotransplantation purposes can involve altering their physiology to reduce the risk of organ rejection in humans; this may have a potential impact on the health and natural behaviour of the animals. Since xenotransplantation involves the sacrifice of animals for the benefit of humans, people who feel more empathy towards animals would likely oppose xenotransplantation. Subjects with a more elevated sense of the need for animal welfare would contend that animals should not be treated as mere resources for human use and that their interests, including their right to live free from unnecessary harm, should be respected. \n\nWhile Egypt has not been traditionally at the forefront of animal rights activism, movements have been on the rise in recent years [88], and there have been some governmental initiatives in this regard [89]. Consequently, although not to the same level as religious identity, animal welfare concerns are a predictive factor of moral approval of xenotransplantation, and policymakers and researchers seeking to establish a firmer hold of xenotransplantation in this nation, need to seriously consider ways of ensuring greater measures of animal welfare in xenotransplantation procedures, to persuade people to morally approve of this technology. \n\nHowever, it is important not to overestimate the role of religious identity or attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) in the moral approval of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).",

            "text": "There are several ethical issues pertaining to clinical xenotransplantation. One such issue concerns defining the harm/benefit ratio in the context of the initial clinical attempts. It might also be difficult to institute an appropriate informed-consent procedure. The fact that the patients will have to be monitored for possible infectious diseases for an extended time, possibly for life, is another ethical concern. \n\nMoreover, there are a number of ethical issues with regards to society at large. The public health hazard posed by the possible transmission and activation of PERV created considerable public concern a few years ago. The public debate that took place also generated some emotionally colored skepticism towards xenotransplantation, in which it was argued that \"transplantation from animal to man will violate the order of nature\". Other objections were with regard to the safety of the future recipients: \"xenotransplantation will constitute experimentation on sick human beings\". It is interesting to note that similar skepticism prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s when human organ transplantation was in its infancy. When it became apparent that transplantation could save a dying patient and bring him back to a normal life, the skepticism and the criticism abated. \n\nThe existence of national guidelines and of an official, institutional surveillance system are prerequisites for clinical trials with xenotransplantation. A number of countries, including the USA and the UK, already have guidelines in place, while others are lagging behind. This raises concerns that some such countries might initiate xenotransplantation programs and attract desperate patients in need of a transplant. The WHO has recently issued a statement against such \"xenotourism\".",

            "text": "Despite the many advantages of xenotransplantation, there are some ethical, legal, and social aspects that must be regulated and considered. First, there are no international legal regulations for pig-to-human xenotransplantation [139]. Their establishment is one of the major milestones in the introduction of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Apart from the lack of legal regulations, introducing xenotransplantation into clinical practice requires a discussion in the society combined with explanation of procedures and knowledge bases. There are concerns that some societies will oppose pig-to-human xenotransplantation because of religious and cultural aspects [140]. Moreover, there is a probability that the use of organs from modified pigs, in some countries, may lead to a global trend of reducing the number of human transplants for altruistic reasons [141]. At this moment, we are unable to predict the reaction of society to a person carrying an animal organ. The social acceptance and the fear of social rejection may pose a risk of a medical procedure refusal by patient. Therefore, there is a need for xenograft recipient anonymity. \n\nThe ethical aspects of xenotransplantation mainly concern the use of animals, namely pigs. Harvesting organs from these animals and transplanting them into humans will in most cases result in the death of the animal. Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding. This type of approach is anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species [142]. For this reason, it is imperative to investigate all alternatives that could replace animal organs and save patients' lives before introducing pig-to-human xenotransplantation into clinical practice [143]. These alternatives so far include, but are not limited to, the use of stem cells and tissue engineering [144]. Thus far, no alternative has been found that would be able to fully replace the functionality of the human organ.",

            "text": "This review aims to show and illustrate the history, current, ethical considerations, and limitations concerning xenotransplantation. Due to the current shortage of available donor organs for transplantation, many alternative sources are being examined to solve the donor shortage. One of them is xenotransplantation which refers to the transplantation of organs from one species to another. Compared to other nonhuman primates (NHP), pigs are ideal species for organ harvesting as they rapidly grow to human size in a handful of months. There is much advancement in the genetic engineering of pigs, which have hearts structurally and functionally similar to the human heart. The role of genetic engineering is to overcome the immune barriers in xenotransplantation and can be used in hyperacute rejection and T cell-mediated rejection. It is technically difficult to use large animal models for orthotopic, life-sustaining heart transplantation. Despite the fact that some religious traditions, such as Jewish and Muslim, prohibit the ingestion of pork products, few religious leaders consider that donating porcine organs is ethical because it saves human life. Although recent technologies have lowered the risk of a xenograft producing a novel virus that causes an epidemic, the risk still exists. It has major implications for the informed consent procedure connected with clinical research on heart xenotransplantation.",

Of course, it is sensible to posit that good animal treatment should be implemented for its own sake, but promoters of xenotransplantation should understand that the quality of animal treatment is fundamental in preserving the base of people who morally approve of xenotransplantation, as bad animal treatment would likely turn away people from approving xenotransplantation procedures, and women are more sensitive on this issue.",

            "text": "Discussion about the ethics of xenotransplantation from the 1990s and early 2000s evolved as the science advanced. Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health [7]. Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)? \n\nEthicists and researchers considered the role of local institutional review boards (IRB) in approving xenotransplant clinical trials [8]. They argued that IRB members, particularly community members who may not have scientific or medical knowledge, would need ongoing education about xenotransplantation. They cited the model of the National Institutes of Health's Re-combinant DNA Advisory Committee, which focused initially on public fears about gene transfer but ultimately provided a public forum to discuss broader issues of gene transfer. IRBs would have to confront the inability of a subject to withdraw from a study once the xenotransplant had been made. In addition to ongoing training, the authors recommend that IRBs bring in nonvoting consultants to help them reach a decision, as well as involve hospital ethics committees in an advisory role, particularly for the ethical concerns of the post-transplant period. \n\nScholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9].",

So much so that the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the NHP preclinical data prior to granting permission for the Baltimore, MD, USA XenoHeart team at the University of Maryland School of Medicine approval for the first pig-to-human heart transplant to be granted (40). The strictest of compliance on ethical grounds is required for any animal study let alone the massive scrutiny undertaken by authorities for NHP research related projects. In most jurisdictions special permission is required, even following appropriate animal ethics approval. Researchers are only allowed to undertake any study with NHPs once accredited and specifically approved due to community concern for their care as they are viewed as so similar to humans. \n\nScholars and ethicists have explored various strategies to mitigate these concerns. The concept of \"minimum moral standing,\" as proposed by Rollin, asserts that pigs raised for xenotransplantation should be provided with living conditions and treatment that accord them a minimum level of moral consideration (41). This includes efforts to reduce suffering and enhance the overall welfare of the animals. Ethical guidelines and regulations often inspired by principles of animal welfare, have been developed to ensure humane treatment throughout the animals' lives and the very best moral and ethical care for all animals.",

Advances in gene editing, including CRISPR technology, have reduced the risk of hyperacute rejection, bringing xenotransplantation closer to clinical application [49]. If successful, xenotransplantation could dramatically expand the organ pool, reducing the need for both deceased and live donors. \n\nHowever, several challenges remain before xenotransplantation can become a routine clinical practice. Concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, long-term immunological compatibility, and ethical questions surrounding the use of animal organs in humans must be addressed. Regulatory frameworks are still developing, and more data are needed to assess the long-term viability and safety of xenotransplanted organs. Despite these hurdles, xenotransplantation has the potential to fundamentally alter LT, providing organs to patients who might otherwise be excluded due to organ shortages.",

A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving.

            "text": "In terms of the non-human animals involved, the ethical focus is often restricted to comparing the relatively small number of pigs used for research with the much larger numbers of animals farmed for meat production. While using animals as a source of 'spare parts' for humans may align with an anthropocentric worldview, it is essential to insist that the frequently made assumption-that using animals to save human lives is acceptable when people also consume them for pleasureis not uncontested (Koplin 2020). From a biocentric perspective, which underlies animal rights activism, dietary choices such as vegetarianism and veganism, both of which are gaining prominence, particularly in countries where xenotransplantation research is conducted, may influence public perception and acceptance. \n\nIt is crucial to note that using animals in xenotransplantation does not equate the life of one pig to the life of one human (Baban et al 2023). In the production process of genetically engineered pigs, less than 1% mature into animals (Entwistle et al 2022), and on the path to clinical implementation in humans, a range of non-human primates, who have been used as proxies, will have perished during preclinical trials. In addition, for porcine islet cell xenotransplants, 10 adult or more than 90 juvenile pigs would be required for one person (Coe et al 2020). Clearly, the number of animals needed for experimental and clinical xenotransplantation is significant. \n\nThe acceptability of animal use for human purposes constitutes one aspect of the 'xenotransplantation paradox' (Haddow 2021a) which involves the simultaneous emphasis on sameness and difference between humans and animals in xenotransplantation discourse (Brown 1999;Cook 2006Cook , 2013;;Hansson 2011;Sharp 2011). The emphasis on similarity across species, as opposed to differences, serves to underscore the feasibility of xenotransplantation. From this framing, physiological differences are not seen as insurmountable barriers. For example, the heart is held to be merely a pump that can function in biological organisms regardless of their species-bound specificity.",

            "text": "This justifies the sacrifice of animals, provided pain and harm are minimized. Concerns about animal welfare in xenotransplantation, such as quarantining pigs in sterile environments, are deemed theologically acceptable as long as there are defined benefits for humans. The lack of voluntary giving from the source animal may raise concerns about exploitation and potential guilt for some individuals. The theology of taskh\u012br, however, overrides any theological culpability, leaving individuals to manage their own psychological responses to the practice. \n\nDespite the theology of taskhir functioning as a buffer against theological culpability, three specific issues related to xenotransplantation may cause theological tensions. Firstly, testing xenografts on brain-dead individuals conflicts with Islamic teachings on honoring the deceased and providing a swift burial. Secondly, the use of human DNA in pigs during the fetal stage for transgenesis necessitates further theological reflection on human experimentation. Lastly, the restrictions imposed on xenograft recipients regarding blood and milk donation, breastfeeding, sexual intercourse, and mandatory medication raise questions about autonomy and require an Islamic response. \n\nIn light of these theological and ethical dilemmas, some scholars argue for alternative solutions, such as synthetic models, 3D printed organs, and cloned organs from stem cells, to reduce reliance on allografts and porcine xenografts [22].",

Two primary cardiac transplantation procedures have been explored: orthotopic cardiac xenotransplantation (oCXTx) and intrathoracic heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation (ITHCXTx) [12]. \n\nThe ultimate goal of xenotransplantation is to save human lives and alleviate suffering related to organ failure [13]. While certain achievements have gained recognition, xenotransplantation remains largely in the preclinical phase, especially for organs with complex vasculature. Ethical considerations also come into play, including concerns related to animal welfare and human autonomy.

The symposium was the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years. This paper summarises the content of the expert lectures showcasing the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including\u2014the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and progress towards clinical xenotransplantation. We then set out the ethical and legal issues still to be resolved. Finally, we report the themes of the roundtable discussion highlighting areas of consensus and controversy. While the detail of the legal discussion was directed towards the UK, the principles and summary reported here are intended to be applicable to any jurisdiction seeking to implement clinical xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "The legislative landscape for xenotransplantation has evolved significantly over the years. As science has advanced, the regulations have been adapted to keep pace with the changing landscape in transplantation but it still lacks the oversight and ability to completely control all that occurs. Despite the best policies and guidance's more universal legislation is required to outlaw and prevent organ trafficking and ongoing issues associated with unscrupulous operators (44). The early years of xenotransplantation were characterized by limited regulatory oversight and fragmented approaches to the management of potential risks due to limited legislation to this new field. However, significant oversight was established early on by the WHO, TTS and IXA to ensure there were guidance's developed to underpin the field (2-4). \n\nHowever, high-profile setbacks and scientific developments have prompted a revaluation of regulatory frameworks. An example of this was the identification of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which raised concerns by government legislators about the potential transmission of these retroviruses to immunocompromised transplant recipients (45). As a result, several jurisdictions-initiated moratorium preventing any clinical xenotransplantation trials from commencing and as such a stronger focus was placed on the assessment and management of this risk in regulatory guidelines (46). \n\nRecently, regulatory bodies have intensified their efforts to provide comprehensive guidelines for xenotransplantation, reflecting a growing recognition of the field's incredible potential with a balance against the risks. Some guidance's such as from the USA FDA have addressed issues such as genetic modifications in source animals, monitoring for infectious agents, and the ethical treatment of donor animals (42). And the USA government and other jurisdictions legislating and licensing biological products such as xenografts, tissues and cells under specific biological products legislation (47).",

            "text": "The use of pigs engineered to grow organs with a low likelihood of rejection raises a number of ethical concerns. Transplant teams utilizing xenografts as a source of donor organs should be prepared to discuss these issues as the regular use of xenografts moves forward in \"daily\" clinical practice. There are many social benefits that xenotransplantation can help realize, namely relief of the long wait times for a suitable allograft, reduction in dialysis complications, and, especially in some parts of the world, elimination of coercion and financial compensation for organs (71). However, a number of ethical and psychosocial issues exist around xenotransplantation that do not necessarily apply to the use of traditional human allografts.\n\nIn some cultures, the use of porcine-based products is considered taboo, though some scholars from these groups will allow for transplants from pigs if the patient would die from organ failure without it (12). There are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88). Keeping in mind the perspective of balancing risks and benefits between use and needs, it is worth mentioning that 240 patients on dialysis die every day in the United States (89).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's",

            "text": "Scholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9]. Participants expressed concern about the ethics of using animals and the stigma of pigs in some religions. While many participants expressed ethical concerns, they didn't see them as a roadblock, particularly if the heart and islet cells from the pig kidney donor could be used for other recipients. Imams and rabbis argued that the need to honor human life would take precedence over religious prohibitions against eating pork. Some participants worried about stigma for the recipient, particularly children, as well as isolation if infection risk required them to stay [10] away from other people. Transplant administrators wondered whether insurers would pay for a pig kidney in someone who was too sick for a human kidney. Some participants questioned whether children should be given priority, while others worried about creating a two-tier system of who gets pig kidneys and whether pig and human kidneys are allocated differently. \n\nIn a theological symposium on xenotransplantation, the main themes among Jewish, Christian and Islamic commentators concerned the duty to heal, the need to treat the whole person and the need to put xenotransplantation in the context of its goals, the effect on the recipient, and the effects on society in terms of equity, justice and cost. A separate discussion of Islamic legal thinking about xenotransplantation examined the inherent contradictions in using an impure animal only if the treatment is considered life-saving [11]. Muhammad Mohiuddin, one of the cardiothoracic surgeons who transplanted a pig heart into a human recipient at the University of Maryland in January, told The New Yorker that as a Muslim he faced resistance from his family when he started to work with pigs. 'We don't eat pork or talk about pork.' But he said after talking to religious leaders, 'the consensus was that saving lives takes precedence over everything' [12].",

Active research in the field of xenotransplantation in the 1990s/2000s was associated with several reports related to the ethical and safety aspects of xenotransplantation [65,66]. Overall, these were favorable, with support of xenotransplantation by the major religions based on easing the suffering of patients if the basic principles of biomedical ethics are observed and animals are treated humanely and with respect [65,67,68]. \n\nA common assumption is that patients with end-stage organ failure who are not eligible for allotransplantation will be enthusiastic participants in xenotransplantation programs and several studies have demonstrated this [3]. However, this has not always been the case, as one study reported that a proportion of acutecare nurses were opposed to xenotransplantation, although this was in the late 1980s when primates were the donors of choice for clinical xenotransplantation [69]. This negative perception has changed as there seems to be less issue with the pig as the donor source animal. However, concerns raised include animal rights and welfare, patient acceptance and informed consent, risk of infectious diseases, and broader public health issues [70]. \n\nThe costs of organ transplantation underlie the potential for inappropriate or corrupt practices in living donor or even cadaveric organ donation in poorer socioeconomic countries. The gap between demand and supply of organs for transplant has led to organ trafficking, organ tourism, and commercialism. This problem remains an overwhelmingly negative issue and raises ethical dilemmas that could be resolved if xenotransplantation were successful and broadly adopted [5,71]. Additionally, multiorgan donation costs are extensive, complicating current financial repatriation to the donor family, donor hospitals, organ donor agencies, and all involved in the extensive logistics of the organ donor process.",

            "text": "Embodied in the wider concepts of informed consent are considerations that young people and the old or infirm are not exploited. Peoples with poor understanding of the language and scientific concepts involved are not to be misled. Religious and cultural feelings are not to be disregarded in potential recipients who find it difficult to express their reluctance to participate in the presence of those whom they perceive as medical authorities. \n\nThe ethical issues of xenotransplantation include concerns over the cultural, ethical and spiritual dimensions of xenotransplantation; the ethical acceptability of using animals to provide tissue for human transplantation; how the welfare of donor animals can be adequately protected and their suffering reduced; and how the welfare and interests of patients in early clinical xenotransplantation trials can be protected. These issues have been addressed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the United Kingdom (1996) and, in New Zealand, the Bioethics Council, Toi te Taiao (2005). The latter body concluded that prohibition of xenotransplantation could not be justified, given the compelling human need argument, and that it should be allowed to develop in New Zealand, with that development being demonstrably shaped by the resolution and management of safety issues by a competent authority; the relationship between the majority European culture and indigenous Maori people and the cultural, ethical and spiritual factors that matter to most New Zealanders. \n\nIn recent years, a number of recommendations to protect the ethical integrity of future human research have been made by various regulatory authorities. Key issues in the conduct of clinical trials of xenotransplantation include the requirement to provide patients with an explanation of the likely success, its attendant risks, and the subsequent quality-oflife that can be expected when obtaining their informed consent, and informing patients that their consent to the procedure includes consent to ongoing post-transplantation microbiological monitoring. \n\nOther international spiritual organisations have given their opinions about xenotransplantation. The Vatican in Rome, Italy have considered xenotransplantation in some depth and suggest it is worthy of serious consideration (Vatican, 2011). Jewish organisations have given qualified support to xenotransplantation as a life enhancing procedure while Muslim opinion is unclear but has generally been negative because of the status of pigs in the religious context.",

These perturbations, as I note above, stem from insights into genomics but also the creation of transpecies hybrid embryos for research and other areas of biotechnology including genetic engineering in addition to immunological insights into species symbiosis and beneficial parasitism, and so on. Xenotransplantation also extends and focuses long-standing controversies about the use of animals as model proxies for humans in medical research, let alone as novel sources of immunologically 'humanised' cells, organs, tissues and biodevices. In historical terms, dating back centuries even, humans have been the recipients of blood and tissues from an eclectic menagerie of animals including other primates and 'higher' simians (apes, baboons, macaques, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, etc.) and 'domesticated' animals (guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, goats, sheep, cows and pigs, etc.). \n\nThe question of species desirability in xenotransplantation has operated in relation to a rich and complex number of socio-cultural, scientific and physiological factors. These include, but are not limited to, the conventional use of some animals as 'meat' in the human food chain; or conversely the breeding of some species as 'companion animals' and pets; whether a species is understood to be a 'wild type' and subject to certain kinds of international protections; the amenability of some animals to rapid reproduction and therefore accelerated cycles of bespoke breeding programmes; the extent to which certain species are known to harbour, or not, various pathogens, parasites and viruses; the relative physiological size of a source species; the different responses of species to genetic engineering for immunological adaptation; the impact of sterile biosecurity measures upon the welfare of different species, and so on. The immunitary biopolitics of xenotransplantation are therefore rife with dilemmas N.

[3] Genetically modified pigs offer hope for a vast supply of organs for transplant in human patients, along with a minimal risk of transplant rejection and disease transmission.

However, we have argued that potential harms, such as zoonosis, transplant rejection and psychological harm, can be mitigated effectively, and that xenotransplantation offers the opportunity to improve or save human lives. Furthermore, the objection that xenotransplantation is unnatural fails, since there is no clear sense in which xenotransplantation is unnatural, and even if there were, this would not demonstrate that it was wrong. These objections thus fail to show that it is ethically unjustifiable to fatally extract pig organs for use in humans to save human lives. [6] n concluding, it is important to re-emphasise that there is currently no direct SA legislation or regulation addressing xenotransplantation.

            "text": "Humans have long been captivated by the possibility of merging physical features of animals and humans. This is evident in Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology, in which human-animal hybrids are deeply entrenched. [1] Xenotransplantation, which is the trans plantation of organs, tissues or clusters of specialised cells from one species to another, may seem like a modern extension of this ancient mythology. [2] nterest in animal-to-human transplantation (xenografts) has significantly increased in the last few decades, owing to the limitations on successful human-to-human organ transplantation (allografts) resulting from chronic scarcities of donated human organs, and transplant rejection. [3] Pig organs are of particular interest, and hold enormous potential to mitigate the rising demand for transplantable human organs, by creating a new and vast supply of organs for human transplantation, thereby potentially resolving the crisis of human organ scarcity. [3] till, xenotransplantation raises several ethical issues. While the ethical and regulatory aspects are much discussed in international contexts, there is little work that considers the South African (SA) context. [4] This is problematic, since in SA there is currently no direct legislation or regulation addressing xenotransplantation. [4] To inform potential regulation in SA, we address the ethics of fatally extracting pig organs for transplantation in humans, and argue that: (i) the benefits of the intervention are likely to outweigh the harms, provided harm mitigation strategies to be discussed are employed; and (ii) that the perceived unnaturalness of xenotransplantation ought not be considered an obstacle to its morality. \n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to clarify our scope in three respects. First, our focus is on pig-to-human organ transplantation, rather than xenograft cell and tissue transplantation. This is because the donation of organs appears likely to raise more significant ethical and emotional concerns. Second, our focus on pigs in particular for xenotransplantation is justified by the fact that this is the type of animal source about which there is the most scientific knowledge. The scientific basis for our claim may differ in other animal species.",

            "text": "The opposite occurs with the implantation of an organ from another individual. In swine organ transplantation, the immunological barrier, even with the current genetic modifications, still represents a major limitation. However, the rapid biotechnological advances currently verified give a perspective of possible control not only of rejection but also of a possible pandemic from zoonosis through technology to remove porcine genes harmful to the human species. \n\nBioethics in its interfaces with humanity fulfills its transdisciplinary role, which goes beyond and across disciplines. It broadens the discussions on morality in the therapy of xenotransplants, including the issue of animal rights, in a desirable platform for discussion about creating/ sacrificing/using for food and creating/sacrificing/using for scientific research. It is interesting how Bioethics encourages us to read some subjects and want to ask some questions, such as thinking about the cultural situation between transplant medicine and nutrition/gastronomy. In this way, bioethics motivates thinking and approaching difficulties in different and multidisciplinary ways, taking advantage of the intelligence of many to develop knowledge. \n\nFinally, it is important to discuss the ethical problem of the criteria for the indication and allocation of genetically modified pigs. These first cases were performed in patients outside the regular criteria for allotransplantation (transplantation between human beings), which could compromise the success of these transplants. Another relevant aspect is the cost of the production of a genetically modified swine. The current cost will certainly restrict the indication of this procedure to people with greater economic power. \n\nThe authors conclude by stating that bioethics in xenotransplantation using genetically modified pigs presents more doubts than certainties. Society as a whole, including bioethicists, politics, and the scientific community, needs to come to some understanding of the risk/benefit calculation and make decisions and protocols about clinical xenotransplantation. This understanding must be based on scientific research with an appropriate methodology that always promotes the elucidation of the truth.",

            "text": "Jaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman. Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).",

            "text": "This study indicates that people's views on xenotransplantation in Egypt are not dramatically different from those held in other countries [39][40][41][42]. While the benefits of xenotransplantation are appreciated, there may still be some ethical concerns, and this is reflected in the overall moral approval rate. The results of the present study suggest that moral opinions about this issue are roughly evenly distributed, suggesting that it is a complicated moral matter. \n\nThe prospect of xenotransplantation makes some people uneasy, given that it raises ethical questions about the boundaries between species [43][44][45][46][47]. This concern typically has various dimensions. First, there is the issue of human exceptionalism. Many philosophical and religious traditions emphasize the unique status of humans. The idea of human exceptionalism asserts that humans possess a distinct moral, intellectual, or spiritual essence that sets them apart from other species. The crossing of species boundaries, such as through genetic engineering or xenotransplantation, challenges this perception and raises ethical questions about the manipulation of fundamental aspects of life. Ethical frameworks often draw on distinctions between species to guide moral decisionmaking. Some individuals believe that certain rights and responsibilities are exclusive to humans, based on perceived moral or cognitive differences. The blurring of species boundaries, as in the case of xenotransplantation, can provoke ethical dilemmas for those who hold such beliefs. Some authors call this the \"xenotransplantation paradox. \" Gill Haddow defines it as the tension in thinking that \"although non-human animals and humans are thought to be biologically compatible or similar, many assume and emphasise just how different we are from  human and what is a non-human animal and yet how shallow the socially constructed division between the species is\" [48]. From a moral psychology perspective, xenotransplantation elicits cognitive discomfort in many people, to the extent that animals used as donors must be sufficiently close to humans (for purposes of anatomical and physiological compatibility, etc.), yet sufficiently distant to not be disturbed by their exploitative use.",

            "text": "There is a higher social acceptance of pig-related products for therapeutic purposesthey have a long history of domestication as livestock and serve as an important food source for human beings. This simple argument is, however, not a valid argument for xenotransplantation, as the research touches on many more ethical aspects. Therefore, xenotransplantation research is accompanied by ethical research to evaluate the perception of the different ethical groups regarding the use of pig organs. Pioneering work has been established by the German xenotransplantation consortium. In a survey of representative citizens, the group considered the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks but called for strict regulatory measures [89]. Despite animals having been used in scientific research for a long time, the main ongoing concern is the welfare of these animals, ensuring that they live well, feel well, and function well [90]. Therefore, when manipulating the pig genome to create humanized pigs for xenotransplantation, it is essential to carefully assess gene modifications to avoid harming the animals' physical and mental health. \n\nWhen employing human PSCs for human-pig chimeras or directly utilizing humanized pig organs for regenerative medicine, we need to avoid human PSCs contributing to the neurons and germ cells. Efforts could be made to specifically eliminate the donor cell contribution in the brain in interspecies chimera [91]. Such scientific advances are expected to help circumvent the contribution of human cells to the pig brain or germ cells. \n\nAgain, the main argument for an overall positive assessment of stem cell research in general and xenotransplantation in particular in the societal context is primarily based on the societal obligation to help people with life-threatening conditions and to alleviate suffering where possible. The fact that research is well ahead of the public consciousness and that a broader societal debate is necessary and still lacking demands ongoing evaluation and regulation to ensure the responsible and safe implementation of using stem cell-and pig-related products in research and medicine. These research activities, including the generation of gene-edited pigs, must have ethical approval by an independent commission and abide by the local and international regulations.",

            "text": "The history of xenotransplantation is peppered with optimistic predictions about its imminence and feasibility. In 1969, the Nobel winning transplant immunologist Peter Medawar hypothesised that We should solve the problem [of organ transplantation] by using heterografts [xenografts]  one day if we try hard enough, and maybe in less than 15 years. 1 More than 20 years later, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics predicted that the first pig to human xenotransplants would be performed in 1996. 2 What followed was almost 30 more years of intense research focused on the remaining immunological and infectious challenges. However, in 2022, xenotransplantation was thrust back into mainstream transplant discourse following two significant developments. First were the reports of two genetically engineered (GE) pig kidneys transplanted into deceased human recipients, mechanically maintained after death by neurological criteria (decedents). 3 4 6][7] This resurgence of activity, in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, comes at a time when public and professional anxieties about zoonoses, public health and experimental treatments are all running high. \n\nIt was on this background that in late 2022 King's College London, with endorsement from the British Transplant Society, and the European Society of Organ Transplantation, brought together a group of experts in xenotransplantation science, ethics and law. This symposium, the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years, aimed to discuss the ethical, regulatory, and technical challenges surrounding translating xenotransplantation into the clinical setting. First, a series of three lectures showcased the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including-the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and preclinical research activities. Following these were sessions introducing ethical and legal concerns. Finally, a roundtable discussion was held. This paper follows this structure first summarising the content of the expert lectures. Then, we report on the broad themes identified in the ethical and legal sessions and the third and final section reflects on the roundtable discussion, highlighting areas of consensus and controversy.",

            "text": "From their viewpoint, according to justified need or necessity, and if the benefits overcomes the degree of pain and suffering to animals, they can be used to meet human's needs while treating them properly (28). \n\nHowever, this group believes that transgenic animals' organ transplantation into human is also criticized because it is against the concept of animal welfare (29). \n\nRegarding this concept, two definitions have been given. In the broad definition, animals should be kept safe from some negative factors like thirst, hunger, pain, suffering, and psychological tensions. In transgenic animals' organ transplantation into human, due to series of experiments, much pain and suffering are imposed on these animals during various steps of this technique. In addition, since there is the possibility of virus transference from animal to human, during their life-time, these animals should be raised with special diets and in supervised environments specified for their growths (30). \n\nBased on the broad definition, the goal, in addition to keeping the animal away from negative factors, is to give a chance to animal to show its species-specific behavior and live according to its type. In other words, in this definition of animal welfare, the concept of being natural is highly emphasized (31). Therefore, genetic modification of animals is basically the total destruction of their welfare because the integrity of animal genome is manipulated to create an animal which is different from its natural type. \n\nFurthermore, in order to prevent transfer of any kind of virus, these animals should be kept in a completely quarantined place and be imprisoned. This has caused a lot of ethical criticism, because keeping animals imprisoned in a place that is not similar to its natural habitat, far from any interaction with its kind, takes its chance to live naturally. \n\nThe broad definition of animal welfare is close to the animal right school, so, it seems that welfare of the animals cannot be provided with this definition in most of the farms and labs. For example keeping cows in closed areas, milking them with new machineries and feeding them with concentrated synthetic foods are totally far from their nature, but are practiced in almost all farms and ranching facilities. Same thing happens in all the labs which work with lab animals. In almost all of the animals at homes, lab animals are kept in small cages and are feed with synthetic food.",

Regulation is not a barrier to entry into the animal breeding industry in the sense that it can be in the pharmaceutical sector. However, any novel foods derived from GM animals are likely to have a considerable regulatory hurdle to overcome. Animal welfare legislation is an issue with which the animal breeding industry is already familiar, but it is not clear how it is being applied in animal agriculture. Another regulatory aspect relevant to animal breeding is the issue of ethical acceptability and it is not clear how this will be resolved.",

The XWP acknowledged 'the submissions and discussion at the public meetings raised many significant concerns and identified issues that were not fully covered by the Discussion Paper or were in need of further consideration and discussion' (XWP 2003a, para 2.3). The XWP reported that there were two shortcomings in the initial consultation: (i) many participants only considered solid organ xenotransplantation, and (ii) participants did not represent 'all interest groups' (XWP 2003a, para 1.15-1.16). They noted that there were few submissions from transplant recipients and patients who may benefit from xenogeneic therapies (XWP 2003a, para 2.9). As such, for the second consultation, the XWP engaged the services of a public relations company to promote community engagement and increase public participation. The XWP was also expanded to include new members with expertise in animal welfare, clinical trials regulation and the management of infectious diseases (XWP 2003a, para 1.18). An Animal Issues Sub-Committee (AIS) was formed to address the issue of animal ethics, animal welfare and the use of animals in experimental transplantation (XWP 2003a, para 1.18). The Terms of Reference for the XWP was redrafted with minor modifications (XWP 2003a, para 1.23). A separate Terms of Reference was prepared for the AIS (XWP 2003a, para 1.24).\n\nIn early 2004, the XWP and AIS issued two documents to undertake the second round of national consultation. A plain English guide on xenotransplantation was prepared to provide accessible information for the general public (XWP 2003b). The XWP set out its responses to the initial consultation in a second discussion paper (XWP 2003a). Though the Working Partying acknowledged that xenotransplantation was highly contested, it concluded that 'there are no significant in-principle ethical objections to the use of live organs and tissues from animals for human the",

This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's natural instincts and needs. The degree of influence of both sides of this conflict has not yet been defined and warrants further exploration involving all stakeholders.\n\nAn additional source of ethical concern would be exposing the immunosuppressed patient to the possibility of zoonotic disease transmission. There are some viruses carried by pigs, particularly porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and Nipah virus that are carried harmlessly by pigs but able to cause significant human disease as human cellular receptors for these viruses exist (88,90). A PERV is suspected to be the virus responsible for a 2009 epidemic of swine flu that led to the loss of over 250,000 human lives. The risk associated with zoonotic viruses would be amplified by posttransplant immunosuppression (3). There are also some bacteria that may potentially be transmitted by a xenograft that risk horizontal transmission across the community. This is in addition to already an increased infection risk burden that is taken on by transplant recipients because of induction and maintenance immunosuppression. This risk is substantially reduced with raising a pig intended as a xenograft donor in a dedicated sterile, biosecure environment, addressing biosafety concerns but raising the aforementioned ethical issues with regards animal welfare. Specialized molecular assays for viruses may also further reduce this risk (90). Utilizing CRISPR technology, a pig has been produced that has had all PERVs inactivated, reducing the risk of infection with PERVs that could occur with xenotransplantation and allaying this source of ethical quandary (71,90,91).\n\nLastly, public perception of scientific breakthroughs and advancement in the field of xenotransplantation raises both fascination and ethical concerns. There should be general societal involvement in the development of xenotransplant policy, but in the United States public understanding of scientific knowledge and the scientific method is lacking (88).\n\nThe field of ethics is often considered \"outside\" of the",

Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is important that certain guidelines are established. The transgenic pigs that have already been developed express small amounts of human protein (e.g., hDAF). Although these animals continue to be very much pigs, some have argued that, with each addition of a human gene to the pig genome, the animal becomes more \"humanized\".\n\nThe extent to which the pigs genome can be manipulated such that the animal maintains its identity as a pig is difficult to define and is a mat-ter of debate. The UK Advisory Group on the Ethics of Xenotransplantation concluded that \"some degree of genetic modification is ethically acceptable\" but that \"there are limits to the extent to which an animal should be genetically modified\".79 Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the group stated that pigs should not be \"genetically manipulated beyond a point that w e would regard as intolerable to the animal (a moral point of view, concerned with the 'pigness' of pigs, which comes a point where the pig is no longer a pig and which might be deemed offensive to all).\" Indeed, the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human as well as pig characteristics, if conceivable, would certainly be unethical and should not be attempted. It is likely that some members of society will advocate that \"humanized'' animals should have some human rights.\n\nIt is unlikely that even an optimal xenograft will outperform a human allograft until w e have several years experience with this form of therapy. It would therefore be counterproductive to reduce the number of cadaveric human organs that become available until the results of xenotransplantation match those of allotransplantation. Overenthusiastic reporting of the early results of clinical xenotransplantation must therefore be avoided, as the public interpretation may be that the donation of human organs is no longer necessary.",

            "text": "Interviewees in our study viewed the ethical implications of animal and human enhancement as significantly different. This is perhaps not surprising in a context in which genome edits to animals are typically to create better models for human disease or disability or to further goals of efficient food production for human communities. For example, enhancement benefits to animals were addressed in the context of their human use while human benefits were considered in comparison to overall risks to them. Even welfare benefits for animals themselves were viewed as related to human interests, and other benefits of animal enhancement were fully instrumentalized to their human purpose -genome edited animals are better \"tools.\" Among the ways animals could be improved for human purposes through gene editing included for climate impact, though this was of marginal interest for gene editing of humans. Similarly, few interviewees raised justice related concerns when considering animal enhancement, though such concerns featured in discussions of human enhancement. How and why participant attitudes differed in assessing human and animal genomic enhancements is further complicated by potential distinctions in what is meant by \"enhancement\" in each context. Overall, the dissimilarities perceived in enhancing animals and humans through gene editing may be attributed to a view that animal enhancement is unburdened by the ethical complexities of human enhancement because of animals' lesser moral status and because germline editing animals is already common practice -it's \"still genetics\". \n\nConsiderations of animal welfare on the one hand, and human risks and benefits on the other, foreground concern for experiential well-being. Beneficence has been appealed to in balancing risks and benefits in human subject research (Beauchamp and Childress 2019; National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1979), while concern for animal experiential well-being in research has typically been considered as a matter of \"refinement\" -i.e., lessening harms and improving housing and husbandry (Russell and Burch 1959;National Research Council 2011). In our study, how enhancements impact experiential well-being featured prominently for both humans and animals, yet participants mainly rejected enhancement for humans due to risk-benefit concerns and largely supported enhancement for nonhuman animals as welfare improvements.",

Xenotransplantation also encompasses anthropology, sociology, and ethics, all of which may have significant impacts on our society, hence we must proceed with caution.\n\nThe experiences in allogeneic organ transplantation have shown that recipients have the belief that they have acquired qualities or adopted traits from the donors after transplantation [24,25].Therefore, human xenotransplantation might bring ethical dilemmas pertaining to personal identity and human dignity, which need to be cautiously evaluated in the process of preparation for clinical trial.\n\nIn 2008 and 2018, in Changsha China, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) developed and updated the WHO regulation for xenotransplantation clinical trials (the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9) with the participation of the Chinese transplant community [26,27].The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 indicated that the Chinese transplant professionals held the ethical and legal issues associated with xenotransplantation in high regard.",

            "text": "The demand for transplant organs far outstrips the supply, forcing thousands of patients to face the possibility that they will die before a compatible organ becomes available. This shortage is particularly acute in patients needing a kidney, where the average wait time for a deceased donor is 5 years (1). The Department of Health and Human Service's Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data reported that an average of 20 Americans die each day awaiting transplant. In 2018, 11 of those deaths were while waiting for a kidney. Additionally, 12 people per day were removed from the kidney transplant waiting list because they were deemed too sick to undergo the rigors of surgery (2).\n\nXenotransplantation (XTx) may be an option in addressing the organ shortage. Recent advances in genetic modification of pigs have demonstrated recipient survival in excess of a year (3). Despite their life-saving potential, the use of animal tissues in humans creates religious, ethical, and psychosocial considerations for all involved parties (4). To begin addressing these, directives from the World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration, and the International XTx Association all call for public involvement and transparency in evaluating the ethics and risks of XTx (5)(6)(7).\n\nGauging public attitudes toward cross-species transplantation is a necessary component to preparing for, and preemptively addressing, concerns should XTx become a clinical reality. Potential ethical considerations for society include religious objections specific to porcine tissues, animal rights, and individual fears of XTx violating the very idea of \"personhood\" (8). However, there is a lack of studies that capture the perceptions of the other major stakeholders regarding the issue of transplant organ supply from the health care providers themselves (9). The purpose of this study was to identify attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs to XTx between different stakeholders in the renal community, who will ultimately be involved in the clinical uptake and/or care of individuals who receive a xenograft.",

            "text": "Subsequently, animal enhancement serves a completely different purpose than human enhancement; hence the ethical evaluation of this procedure can be entirely different. Developments in biotechnology over the past 25 years have allowed scientists to engineer genetically modified (GM) animals that are used in agriculture, medicine and homelife. An example of animal enhancement to better serve human needs is the modification of dairy cows or chicken to raise their productivity. These modified animals should also gain weight faster or be immune to diseases caused by intensive animal farming. Despite such a rationale, the changes cause the animals to suffer. For example, the joints of chicken often cannot withstand their weight (Forabosco et al. 2013;PETA 2017). \n\nAnother example of animal enhancement is laboratory animals modified to be animal models for human diseases. Although the use of anatomy and physiology began in ancient Greece, the discoveries of the New Genetics have allowed for lasting and more useful improvement of animals (Ericsson et al. 2013). \n\nThe most widespread response among both medical researchers and ethicists was brought about by the creation of the oncomouse at Harvard University in 1984 1 . Inducing human breast cancer cells into mouse embryos created an animal that is vulnerable to oncological diseases. The model is currently used in preclinical trials of oncological therapies. Another example are animals with induced diabetes, depression or Huntington's disease. From the point of view of basic and pharmaceutical research, these animals provide an ideal research model for specific diseases. \n\nHowever, another example of using animals to advance medical research is a specific group of transplantation procedures, namely xenotransplantation (also called heterogenous transplantation). The procedures consist of transplantation between two different species. According to the definition of the U.S. Public Health Service: \n\nXenotransplantation is now defined to include any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a non-human animal source or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs. Furthermore, xenotransplantation products have been defined to include live cells, tissues or organs used in xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Regarding the use of animals' organs in transplantation into human, some of the supporters of the animal rights have disagreed strongly about human's using animals for any kind of their needs through emphasizing on equal rights of animal and human being. As a result, from their point of View, torturing and killing animals to transplant their organs to human beings is unethical and means lowering animals' status to things or to a tool box. 28 Along with this point of view, another group of animal ethics philosophers, especially utilitarian philosophers like Peter Singer, have not refused the idea of using animals for saving human life, and in contrast, only through attribution requirements, they have tried to limit and to decrease the quantity and quality of such a use. 29 ased on the broad definition, the goal, in addition to keeping the animal away from negative factors, is to give a chance to animal to show its species-specific behavior and live according to its type. In other words, in this definition of animal welfare, the concept of being natural is highly emphasized. 30 erefore, genetic modification of animals is basically the total destruction of their welfare because the integrity of animal genome is manipulated to create an animal which is different from its natural type. Furthermore, in order to prevent transfer of any kind of virus, these animals should be kept in a completely quarantined place and be imprisoned. This has caused a lot of ethical criticism, because keeping animals imprisoned in a place that is not similar to its natural habitat, far from any interaction with its kind, takes its chance to live naturally. The broad definition of animal welfare is close to the animal right school, so, it seems that welfare of the animals cannot be provided with this definition in most of the farms and labs.",

            "text": "For now, it is difficult to predict what the eventual outcome of this ethical discussion will be. But if ethicists eventually reach a consensus that xenotransplantation is a morally acceptable procedure (admittedly, that is a big \"if \") and it is one that is worth pursuing in biotechnological advancement, then the present study has some implications for policy. \n\nOn the one hand, for xenotransplantation to be more accepted in Muslim countries, researchers need to start considering alternatives to pigs in procedures and explore the possibility of using permissible animals in Islam (sheep, cows, etc.). Admittedly, this is a very difficult endeavor, as there are many technical problems in using these animals for xenotransplantation. \n\nOn the other hand, assuming that xenotransplantation becomes an effective and safe procedure, policymakers need to work with religious authorities to favor an interpretation of Islam in which pigs are not allowed for consumption, but they may be allowed as sources of organ transplantation, especially considering that xenotransplantation may save lives, and Islam has a strong tradition of flexibility if it comes to life-saving procedures. \n\nFurthermore, it is important to highlight that religious identity (not religiosity) is the relevant factor in predicting moral approval of xenotransplantation, and consequently, policymakers ought to work with religious and secular authorities-again, assuming the full viability and success of xenotransplantation-in order to find a way of assuring Muslims (regardless of their level of religiosity) that xenotransplantation from pigs is not a threat to their religious identity. \n\nHowever, it is more likely that the core of xenotransplantation (and not merely its accessory features) will remain ethically contentious. In that case, it is important for leaders of civil society in Egypt to facilitate discussions in order to help people make informed decisions that align with their moral interests, and on that basis, allow people to come to their own moral conclusions regarding xenotransplantation. If some people come to decide that there is no scenario in which xenotransplantation is morally admissible, then that commitment should be respected.",

            "text": "Previous research has established that women, on average, may exhibit higher levels of empathy and compassion toward animals compared to men. Likewise, women are often prominent in animal advocacy and activism; they may be more likely to engage in activities such as volunteering at animal shelters, supporting animal rights organizations, and advocating for humane treatment. Women, on average, may be more likely to own pets and to express strong emotional bonds with their animals; the companionship and caregiving aspects of pet ownership can contribute to a heightened awareness of animal welfare issues [101]. Women are often overrepresented in occupations related to animal care, such as veterinary medicine, animal welfare organizations, and pet grooming [102]; this professional involvement may contribute to a heightened awareness of and concern for animal welfare. \n\nAs per the mediation analysis of this study, attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) serve as partial mediator of women's greater moral disapproval of xenotransplantation. Therefore, once again, assuming that xenotransplantation is a worthy moral endeavor (to the extent that, as mentioned in the Introduction, xenotransplantation is a viable partial solution to the problem of shortage of organs in donation), and assuming that it is desirable to increase the moral acceptance of xenotransplantation amongst Egyptians, policymakers and researchers ought to focus on women. But in so doing, it must be understood that an important way of increasing women's approval of xenotransplantation comes through some assurance that animals used in xenotransplantation would be offered some acceptable measure of welfare. \n\nInterestingly, in this study, pet owners do show attitudes of greater care towards animals, as measured by BMAAS (t(893) = \u2212 3.59, p < 0.01, d = \u2212 3.67). This reproduces some results in previous research [103,104]. But in this study, owning a pet is not, by and of itself, a relevant factor in predicting the moral approval of xenotransplantation. The relevant aspect is attitudes towards animals (as measured by the BMAAS) on a more abstract level. \n\nFinally, it is important to consider whether having a child may predict approval of xenotransplantation.",

While it provides hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, it also raises ethical, psychosocial, and regulatory issues. These issues challenge us both as human beings and in our relationship to animals and should be discussed among broader society. In order to elicit well-informed public opinion on the benefits and risks of xenotransplantation, we organized a citizens' conference. After deliberating over three weekends, the participants drafted an evaluative statement on xenotransplantation and made recommendations to scientists and policy makers. Overall, the citizen group considers the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks, but calls for strict regulatory measures to ensure the development of a sustainable and ethically justifiable biotechnology. One hundred and ninety-five days. This is the period of time denoted for a scientific breakthrough in the field of xenotransplantation (XT) (La \u00a8ngin et al, 2018). Baboons survived for 6 months with a genetically modified pig heart. Bringing xenotransplantation to patients with the prospect of reducing the current shortage of donor organs has thus become more realistic. This success owes to significant progress regarding the immunological challenges of XT on the molecular level and by better genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (Sykes & Sachs, 2019). The time has come to align the necessary infrastructure of policy making, legal, and medical regulation, political administration, market interests, and public opinion. \n\nWhile these advances in XT provide hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, they also raise ethical and philosophical issues: Is it ethically acceptable to breed animals and use them as an organic spare parts stock? What does it mean anthropologically for patients to live with an animal organ or animal tissue? How shall we balance the potential benefits and risks of XT therapies, given that everyone could potentially benefit as an organ recipient, but at the same time may risk acquiring a xenogeneic infectious disease?",

A concerted effort is required to navigate the intricate interweaving of scientific advancement and ethical imperatives. Recognition of underlying ethical issues, awareness and education of ethical dilemmas are the key first step to resolve. Clinical ethicists and bioethicists should be involved in research protocols, scientific experimentation, and implementation procedures. One such avenue for future exploration lies in addressing ethical concerns surrounding interspecies organ transplantations. Research endeavours should prioritize the development of robust immunomodulatory strategies to minimize the risk of rejection and zoonotic transmission, ensuring the safety, efficacy and long-term utility of xenogeneic liver transplantation. Furthermore, the emergence of stem cell therapies offers unprecedented opportunities to overcome the limitations of traditional organ transplantation. Ethical issues such as informed consent, patient autonomy and equitable access to emerging treatment modalities should find a prominent place in public discourse. A deeper dive into the concerns related to genetic manipulation and long-term safety is due. Ethical frameworks have to be established to properly govern the creation and utilization of human-animal hybrids. Collaborative efforts between scientists, surgeons, policymakers and ethicists will be essential to navigate the complexities to ensure that management principles are still guided by the principles of beneficence, justice and respect for human dignity.",

Animal welfare is a major concern during the application of xenogeneic products in humans. Since animals' welfare is a major ethical issue, it is considered by regulatory bodies before approving any product of animal origin for clinical use. \n\nAlso, during the clinical trial stages or in long term, the volunteers or the patients and the close contacts should be educated about the chance of infectious disease risks and about how to manage those risks. Moreover, such counseling should also be continued for long term as some infection may take years to get manifested. Also, lifelong surveillance is advised by FDA irrespective of the status of the implant or graft or other xenotransplantation product. \n\nConversely, 3D bioprinted in vitro organs and tissues that are being developed using dECM are expected not to pose potential threat to recipients. This is because the cell and nucleus materials are being removed from the tissue using harsh chemicals during the process of decellularization. However, the regulatory bodies ensure that xenotransplantation is allowed only when there are evidences that show nearzero chance of recipient getting infected and informed consent, and acceptance for lifelong postoperative care from the patient was collected [116]. Nevertheless, stringent regulations will be required from regulatory bodies to monitor the pros and cons for a longer duration.",

On January 7th, 2022, a successful genetically edited porcine to human HT was performed with 60 days patient survival (31). On autopsy, the xenograft showed findings that were not consistent with typical rejection: it was edematous, nearly doubled in weight, and histologic examination revealed scattered myocyte necrosis, interstitial edema, and red-cell extravasation, without evidence of microvascular thrombosis. Studies are currently under way to identify the mechanisms responsible for these changes (32) and clearly, this experience has highlighted the presence of pathophysiological patterns that have yet to be understood. The topic of xenotransplantation, which could allow new, exciting therapeutic perspectives, raises political, ethical and moral concerns, that will have to be addressed in the years to come. Nevertheless, it represents an interesting new frontier which could make a significant contribution in solving the problem of donor shortage, guaranteeing survival hopes for patients with terminal heart disease currently lacking therapeutic alternatives.",

The results showed that religiosity itself does not predict moral approval of xenotransplantation, but religious identity does, as Muslims are less likely to approve of xenotransplantation than Christians. However, the strongest predictor of moral approval of xenotransplantation was gender, with women displaying less approval. A partial mediating factor in this association was concern for animal welfare. Based on these results, some implications for public policy are discussed.",

Sanctity of life is a top priority (Quran: 5:32) and so is human dignity.

Some people hold the view that xenotransplantation inevitably compromises species boundaries and erodes human dignity. Animal welfare groups also opposed xenotransplantation on the grounds that nonhuman animals should not be treated as redesignable systems [30]. In fact, various animal products are already used in humans. For example, bioactive bones from decellularized bovine femoral bone and freeze-dried bone marrow stem cell paracrine factors are extensively used in large-sized bone defects [48]. These achievements are gradually changing the public's outlook, paving the way for xenogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, potential applications must consider customs, laws, religions, and other factors in different regions.",

            "text": "the more the human element in such combinations increases, the more it is perceived as problematic: if a gene of human origin is introduced into an animal, it is not yet \"humanized\". thus, there are generally few misgivings in relation to the use of individual genes from the human organism in an animal or, conversely, the use of a therapeutically effective animal gene in the somatic genetic therapy of humans. the use of adult animal tissue in humans for therapeutic purposes, e.g. animal heart valves or the implantation of animal cells in cellular xenotransplantation, is also largely accepted. In general, it would appear that the integration of individual cells from a different species into the body of a human or an animal is accepted (microchimerism). this is not perceived as either the \"humanization\" of the animal in question or \"animalization\" of the human involved. Countless symbiotic alien organisms and even endoparasites reside permanently in every human being and animal. \n\nthe situation would appear to be different, however, when it comes to an elevated alien-species proportion, namely when structures, organ parts or organs are formed using human cells in an animal organism, when control is taken of the development of the host organism and when, in the case of transplantations into the brain, the characteristics of humans or another animal species arise in the animal. In the view of the NeK these concerns are based on the fact that the possible development by the chimera of a rudimentary form of the perception, sensibility, experience or consciousness of humans or another animal species cannot be excluded. According to the NeK, reservations in relation to the formation of organ parts or partial structures of humans in animals and in relation to interspecies chimeras in humans for research or therapeutic purposes are justified from a human ethical perspective (NeK, 2006). \n\nIn terms of animal ethics, the fundamental question arises as to whether the generation of chimeras or inter-species hybrids can be justified. The Ethics Committee for Animal Studies of the SAMS and SCNAt does not fundamentally question the generation of chimeras and hybrids in relation to the protection of the welfare and dignity of the animal, nevertheless it deems the observation of restrictive conditions as necessary for the generation of chimeras and hybrids.",

In addition to these general ethical concerns, South Korea's strong Confucian influence necessitates culturally tailored ethical considerations. Therefore, enough public discussions, social consensus and appropriate regulatory framework are required before proceeding with human trials and clinical application [13]. Previously, similar surveys on the perception of xenotransplantation were conducted in Korea [14,15]. Given that xenotransplantation technology now extends to organ transplantation, which bring about new issues and ethico-legal implications, it is time to conduct another perception survey.",

            "text": "The world has witnessed several efforts in xenotransplantation involving the implantation of genetically engineered organs derived from pigs into human patients. Specifically, these include two heart and two kidney surgeries in the USA and a liver transplant in China. The heart transplantation patients survived 6 and 8 weeks, the kidney patients 2 months. For the liver transplantation patient from China, there is no news available. 1 Xenotransplantation has also seen initial exemplifications as a subject of policymaking. It marked the first instance in which the precautionary principle was advised in the realm of bioethics (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014). Additionally, xenotransplantation has prompted public consultation projects in several countries as well as an European Union-wide research project on participatory technology assessment (Griessler et al 2012). In social research, xenotransplantation serves as an instructive example to illustrate forms of governance and control such as 'pre-emptive' biopolitics and various social relations (including those associated with patienthood, animal ethics, biocapital and expertise). \n\nXenotransplantation is not a new science and there are documented experiments dating back to at least the 1600s (Deschamps et al 2005) with an intensification of sporadic attempts in the USA especially during the mid-to-late 20th century involving non-human primates as source animals and human patients. Most recently, novel scientific insights have emerged with the development of the gene editing system CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a tool that scientists working in the field of xenotransplantation praise for its technoscientific capacities to overcome previous hurdles like porcine endogenous retroviruses alongside a host of other transspecies immunological challenges. In addition to the recent pig-to-human transplantations, experiments with genetically engineered pig organs have been conducted on brain-dead individuals in the USA and in China, attempting to supplement the preclinical non-human primate model (Montgomery et al 2024). Yet despite these developments and changes in the scientific and clinical landscape of xenotransplantation, many social and ethical aspects persist.",

            "text": "are those that relate to the issue of introducing a problematic degree of humanness into the non-human animal, and in synergy with this the principle for adjudication that is being settled on is that of 'human dignity'.\n\nAt the same time, the animal perspective is excluded from both the governance agenda and its operational implementation. No attention is paid to any problems for the animal that is modified to be more like a human. The focus is entirely on the problems for humans of creating human-like animals. Commenting on the 2005 US National Academy of Sciences Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research recommendation that experiments introducing hESC into an NHP blastocyst should not be permitted, Alta Charo, one of the report's authors, commented that such research 'might humanize animals in ways that are unnerving' (quoted in Scott, 2006, p. 490). In this vein, the question of recipient species is allowed into discussion on the basis that if the animal is closely related to humans, there is less leeway for adding human material before it becomes 'too human' for our comfort. An alternative argument could be made, but is not, that a closely related species is more likely to suffer like us from this experimentation.\n\nThe exclusive agenda-setting power of the emphasis in the bioethical governance discourse solely on problems that accrue for humans is revealed through its sharp contrast with much of the previous debate on the ethics of this kind of research. For example, in debates over the genetic modification of animals, the problem of the possible negative impact on the animal's wellbeing from the gene introduced has been a significant part of the debate (ECVAM, 1998;Boyd Group, 1999, p. 4.2.1;APC, 2001, p. 24). The 'Beltsville Pig', genetically engineered with genes to increase growth rate, suffered a range of disorders including painful bone and joint problems and diminished vision, and was frequently cited as an example of the negative impact on the animal of transgenic technology. The focus on the human also runs counter to existing regulatory frameworks for the use of animals in scientific research. In the majority of countries, these are based on well-established ethical frameworks for animal welfare, with the principle of the '3Rs' (of Replacement of animals where possible, Refine",

            "text": "The ethics of animal use for purposes of transplantation should be consistent across species and between captive and wild-caught animals. Moral responsibility assumes the target species is not endangered in the wild or is readily bred in captivity, and is treated with compassion and respect. Organ transplantation does not, and will never, represent an excuse for wholesale slaughter of any animal species. However, preservation and enhancement of the human species is the legitimate aim of xenotransplantation. That alone justifies utilization of baboons as surrogate participants in the research process. The individual life and welfare of a human should, ethically speaking, always trump concerns for the individual life of an animal, be it nonhuman primate or otherwise. \n\nThe concern for the broader issues of health and welfare of the human species is also a vital part of the quest for xenotransplantation. That quest goes beyond individual recipients and their families and caregivers. It has the potential to involve all of mankind if, indeed, novel infections of animal origin are introduced into the global population. Investigators need to determine if the cross-species transplantation risk to public health is real or if it is simply a perception of risk. Based on anecdotal history and laboratory and clinical studies, a \"real\" risk has yet to be demonstrated. Copious laboratory virology, however, suggests that caution is appropriate. \n\nThe perception of risk to the public health has occasionally stimulated intense, almost evangelical debate in public forums, in news media, and in the world of science fiction literature and motion pictures. The shading of objectivity on this issue has been distressingly counterproductive to the development of xenotransplantation. Clearly, if the discussion about the risk to public health is not laced with reason and solid, clinically applicable science, then the xenotransplant enterprise will not go forward, and will not succeed. Guidelines and safeguards for this type of research should be established, and investigators should thoroughly examine the potential for infectious disease transfer from animal donor to human recipient and beyond. Progress in xenotransplantation and future clinical trials cannot be aborted on the basis of a general fear of potential risk to public health. Intensive research is needed to minimize the public health concerns associated with what may be a critical lifesaving approach in the future.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is the process of transplanting organs, tissues, or cells from one species into another species, most commonly into humans. The primary goal of xenotransplantation is to address the shortage of human donor organs and potentially provide a more readily available source of organs for transplantation [1]. \n\nThe process goes through various phases. First, animal donors are chosen on the basis of suitability of their organs being of similar in size and function to human organs; originally baboons and other non-human primates were used, since the 1980s pigs have been preferred in this endeavor. Second, donor animals are genetically modified to reduce the risk of immune rejection and transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis), donor animals are genetically modified [2]. This can involve removing or modifying specific genes responsible for producing antigens that are recognized by the human immune system. This process is known as \"humanization\" of the animal's organs. Even with genetic modifications, the human recipient's immune system can still recognize animal tissues as foreign and trigger a rejection response. To prevent this, recipients receive immunosuppressive drugs to dampen their immune response, similar to what is done in human-to-human organ transplantation [3]. \n\nThird, the donor animal organ, which has been genetically modified, is surgically transplanted into the human recipient. The specific surgical procedure varies depending on the organ being transplanted [4]. Fourth, after transplantation, the recipient is closely monitored for any signs of rejection or complications. Regular medical check-ups and immunosuppressive drug therapy adjustments may be necessary to maintain the viability of the transplanted organ [5]. \n\nWhile xenotransplantation is a promising alternative, some challenges remain. For example, immune rejection is still a problem, and there is a potential risk of transmitting animal viruses to humans, which must be carefully managed and monitored. Perhaps the bestknown case was that of Baby Fae, who died a few weeks later after receiving a baboon's organ, largely due to immunological complications [6]. This suggests that with xenotransplantation, there are concerns about the need for lifelong surveillance of patients after receiving the organ. \n\nOther concerns are ethical.",

            "text": "In addition, cultural factors play a significant role in the acceptance of xenotransplantation in countries where post-mortem allotransplantation is not possible from a social point of view. For example, in Japan and India organ transplants from animals are a feasible alternative, but the opponents of these procedures cite various arguments against them, including philosophical, legal and medical factors. Of significance are also the above-mentioned arguments concerning the pursuit of anthropocentrism at all costs, and the utilitarian nature of such activity when animals become a \"reservoir of spare parts\" for people. Other issues involve potential problems with the recipient's identity and concerns relating to the \"tyranny of the gift\"6 . \n\nIn general, transplantation is usually perceived as a gift (Chyrowicz 2011), as an informed and fully voluntary decision. But can we really speak of informed decisions in the case of animals? Could the moral dilemma that is harvesting animal organs be solved by measures taken to increase the number of allotransplantations? These measures should target the largest possible groups of recipients to reliably present to them the dangers of organ donation, in addition to making them aware that transplantation is a lifesaving procedure which has no other substitute (Baum 2017). Using animal organs would not be necessary if there was a significant increase in donations from relatives and other unrelated living donors7 . \n\nLegal issues are also a cause of concern as the recipient loses at least some of their rights to anonymity and privacy, whilst being obliged to inform the people around them (including the medical community) of having a xenograft in their body (Smor\u0105g 2006). This may cause the organ recipient to feel discomfort and a sense of discrimination. Another legal aspect is the possible existence of \"xenotourism\", in other words, organised and commercial journeys to countries where xenotransplantation is possible8 . Nowadays, another example of controversial ethical research is creating animal embryos that contain human cells and transplant them into surrogate animals. The study was approved in 2019 in Japan (Cyranowski 2019).",

A few other groups are concerned with the limitation of modern science to fully comprehend the potential negative ramifi cation and unforeseen possible effects of genetic manipulation . \n\nDespite the importance of transgenic animals in biomedical research, there are some concerns raised about their use in research. Transgenic animals suffer more abnormalities than regular research animals. The introduction of DNA into an animal can be very complex and the possible side effects can be diffi cult to predict. Possible harm might arise from surgical techniques used to harvest and reimplant embryos, the collection of tissue from the tip of the tail for genotyping, and nonspecifi c effects caused by damage to genes adjoining the altered area. In addition, reduced fertility and/or oversize fetuses may result from this technology. In most cases the mutations highly affect specifi c metabolic processes or cell receptors without actually resulting in disease but causing discomfort, pain, or malfunctioning in the animals. \n\nTransgenic animals not expressing foreign DNA or not containing a particular gene modification are destroyed. Because transgenesis is a complex science, it is not 100 % effi cient. However, new methods are being developed to increase the accuracy in transgenesis. Again, it should be remembered that such genetic alteration could only be attempted if the authorities are persuaded that there is no other way to pursue important research. The potential risks of transgenics to animals, humans, and the environment are too great to justify their use. The Genetic Modifi cation of Organisms regulations and the Environmental Protection Act (1990) address the risks to those working with animals and the impact on the environment of accidental or planned releases . \n\nThe intrinsic worth of animals may be devalued and their integrity violated by genetic modification. Transgenic animals have not chosen to have foreign DNA or other genetic modifi cations. However, this potential \"cost\" to the animals is routinely assessed under the ethical review of proposed procedures and weighed against the potential benefi ts.",

These concerns stem from the study's complexity, the procedures' invasiveness, and the potential for suffering in NHPs. For the welfare of the NHP, the following points should be considered. \n\nReproductive engineering techniques often involve highly invasive procedures such as oocyte retrieval, embryo transfer, or hormonal manipulation. To minimize distress and harm, these procedures should be performed with the utmost care and precision, ideally under anesthesia or appropriate analgesia, and only when necessary for the research objectives. Effective anesthesia and analgesia should be administered to minimize pain and discomfort, and the animals should be monitored continuously to detect signs of distress or discomfort. Where possible, researchers should explore non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques to gather data, such as non-invasive imaging, blood or urine analysis, and genomic studies. \n\nGenetic modifications (e.g., CRISPR) for reproductive engineering in NHPs raise additional ethical concerns, especially regarding unintended genetic consequences and the long-term impact on animal welfare. Ethical review is crucial to ensure that such experiments are conducted with appropriate safeguards and that potential risks are minimized. \n\nEthical considerations regarding using NHPs in reproductive engineering are complex but crucial. They revolve around minimizing harm, ensuring scientific necessity, and providing appropriate animal care throughout their lives. Ethical guidelines, such as those offered by IACUCs and institutional review boards, exist to ensure that NHPs are treated with respect, their welfare is a top priority, and their use is scientifically justified. Adhering to these principles ensures humane treatment and enhances the credibility and legitimacy of the research.",

            "text": "Similarly, it has been found over the years of public opinion surveys that public perceptions of risk are higher when they concern GM animals rather than GM crops/microorganisms and are also perceived as riskier and having more ethical concerns if the context is food applications rather than medical applications as the latter tend to be evaluated on a more specific or case-by-case basis (Frewer, 2003;Frewer et al., 2011). The two differences that appear when comparing surveys from before and after the introduction of CRISPR-Cas9 technology are largely associated with the type of questions that were asked. In pre-CRISPR surveys, most respondents see laboratory research in animal models like GM mice as useful but not morally acceptable. This reflects an ambivalence between what is perceived to be a valuable objective (the study of human disease) and the concerns over animals' welfare (Spencer, 1999;EASAC, 2017;de Graeff et al., 2019). In the CRISPR surveys that include animal applications, the questions are about applications where genetic modification is done to avoid animal welfare problems, and while people mention some concerns, in particular about potential suffering, overall, they see it as something good. However, they also reveal an unwillingness to consume products derived from these animals, similar to respondents in pre-CRISPR surveys. This follows the usual perception of risks and ethical concerns where the public has also been found to be willing to pay less for GM foods than conventional ones (Frewer et al., 2011). Impacts on human health by the introduction of genetically modified species in the food chain, unnaturalness, and potential ecosystem disturbance are also recognized as moral issues of these interventions (Nuffield Council of Bioethics, 2016;EASAC, 2017;Nordberg et al., 2018;de Graeff et al., 2019). Impacts on biodiversity and sustainability are repeatedly identified ethical concerns about the genetic modification of animals, together with animal welfare, tampering with nature, and unnaturalness (Frewer et al., 2004;MacNaghten, 2004;Schuppli and Weary, 2010;Frewer et al., 2011).",

The Nuffield Council on Bioethics, an independent British charity, conducted the first public inquiry on the topic. In March 1996, it issued an influential report titled, Animal-to-Human Transplants: The Ethics of Xenotransplantation. The Council's report concluded that it is 'ethically acceptable' to use pig organs and tissues for transplantation given the scarcity of human biological material (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 1996, viii). Adopting a precautionary approach on xenotransplantation, the report recommended the establishment of an advisory committee to oversee and monitor xenotransplantation research and clinical trials. According to Sobbrio and Jorqui, the Nuffield Council report was innovative since it was the first attempt to apply the precautionary principle to protect public health beyond the field of environmental science and humanities (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014). In the following year, an interdisciplinary committee appointed by the UK Department of Health put forward a comparable report. Commonly known as the 'Kennedy Report' after its chairperson, Sir Ian Kennedy, this document reiterated some of proposals made in the Nuffield Council report (U. K. Department of Health 1997). Following both reports, the government promptly set up the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA). Inter alia, the terms of reference for UKXIRA instructed the authority to provide advice to government on 'safety, efficacy and considerations of animal welfare and any other pre-conditions for xenotransplantation for human use, and whether these have been met' (UKIXRA 1998, 24).\n\nIn March 1997, a shift in the trajectory of xenotransplantation research occurred when leading virologist, Clive Patience and his colleagues alerted scientists and the general public to the risks of infectious diseases associated with Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV). Endogenous retroviruses are found in the genome of all mammal species. Since porcine retroviruses are embedded in the swine genome, it would be difficult to selectively breed pigs free of PERV and other pathogens. The expression",

            "text": "Western European societies clearly differ-entiate between organs in respect to their species of origin. Considerably less controversial is the use of transgenic animals, for instance bred organs from pigs, than using organs from monkeys, despite their anatomic and physiologic similarity to people. Primates seem especially close to the human species due to the affinity between them (being the closest phylogenetically related). This, however, raises some concerns, as the relatively high level of compatibility means that some baboon and chimpanzee viral pathogens can infect people (Smor\u0105g and S\u0142omski 2005). Moreover, the breeding of monkeys is more demanding. Their fertility is much lower and gestation longer in comparison to pigs, which have turned out to be the optimal animals. Furthermore, public discourse attaches great importance to religious issues. The three monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) accept xenotransplantation, allowing the use and modification of nature (including the animal world) if this serves the development and welfare of humankind. Humans have the right to intervene in the work of God. Moreover, Islam and Judaism accept pig xenotransplantation, because they do not see this as the consumption of meat, but as a considerable advantage resulting from using animal organs (Smor\u0105g 2011). \n\nIn the Catholic Church, already in 1956 Pope Pius XII spoke of xenotransplantation in his address to the Italian Corneal Donors Association and the Italian Blind Association, stating that it is acceptable when the transplanted organ does not violate the recipient's mental and genetic identity, and the risk associated with the procedure is relatively small (Knia\u017a 2005). Nonetheless, it should be stressed that the Catholic Church has spoken against xenotransplantation in relation to gonads and brain cells (Smor\u0105g 2011). Some other religions, for instance, Buddhism and Hinduism, have different perceptions of the relationship between humans and animals, whilst concerns regarding animal organ transplants are left to the believers' individual judgement. In addition, cultural factors play a significant role in the acceptance of xenotransplantation in countries where post-mortem allotransplantation is not possible from a social point of view.",

First of all, the possibility of off-target mutations in the genome can lead to diseases or different side effects in animals (Ishii, 2017a;Schultz-Bergin, 2018;de Graeff et al., 2019). Such a situation will adversely affect animal welfare (Rodriguez, 2017). \n\nThe second bioethical issue to be discussed could be the concerns about \"animal dignity\" (Eriksson et al., 2018) and alterations in their natural environments and physiological needs (Manesh et al., 2014). Some studies have stated that the use of animals as objects only serving for humans is not ethically or morally acceptable (Martinelli et al., 2014;Fung and Kerridge, 2016;Greenfield, 2017), and such practices can lead to greater control over humans on animals (Ishii, 2017a;de Graeff et al., 2019). Some others think that animals are not bound by any moral law and therefore there is no need for a discussion regarding animal dignity (Heeger, 2015;Shriver and McConnachie, 2018). Schultz-Bergin (2017) stated that animal rights, welfare, and dignity will not be adversely affected since these animals will occur through genome editing technologies. The existence of contrary opinions on this matter indicates that the mentioned bioethical issues will be on the agenda for a long time.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is a clinical biotechnology that has great potential to alleviate the global shortage of organs available for transplantation. However, whilst conventional organ donation involves several ethical questions, xenotransplantation raises several additional novel ethical objections. \n\nThis may be especially the case in the Muslim world, as the animal most suited for xenotransplantation is the pig, and this animal has traditionally been considered impure in Islam. The results of the present study indicate that, indeed, the fact that xenotransplantation involves the use of pig tissue is an obstacle to moral approval amongst Muslims in Egypt. But importantly, the relevant factor is not the level of religiosity itself, but rather, religious identity. Muslims in Egypt seem to be less likely than Christians to morally approve of xenotransplantation, but only when it involves pigs. Likewise, Muslims in Egypt are more likely to accept xenotransplantation if it involves sheep's organs. However, it is important to keep in mind that this study is limited to the extent that the proportion of Christian participants was small (lower than the proportion of Christians in Egypt at large), and therefore, no overly robust conclusions can be obtained. \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the present study is concerned with moral psychology, and it is not a normative treatise. We have sought to examine what participants think about the ethics of xenotransplantation, but we have not sought to examine whether such stances are morally correct or not. Indeed, the ethics of xenotransplantation may be a nonstarter, to the extent that from the onset, such a project may be morally flawed. Even if a particular animal that is not considered impure in any major religion is chosen (say, the sheep) for xenotransplantation, even if we assume it to be ethically acceptable to blur the boundaries between species by creating human-animal hybrids, and even if animal donors are given good treatment and are painlessly killed to procure their organs, some philosophers may make the case that xenotransplantation is still immoral. \n\nPhilosophers have long debated whether it is immoral to eat meat.",

            "text": "With recent achievements and the accumulation of experience with xenotransplantation in preclinical research, the first-inhuman clinical trial may be possible in the near future. It is an inevitable trend that pigs modified with multiple genes are to be used as donor animals for xenotransplantation. New gene-editing technologies enable the production of multiple genetically engineered pigs in shorter periods of time and with greater efficiency. Various types of gene-modified pigs already exist, most of which are being tested in preclinical pig-to-NHP xenotransplantation models. In addition, new xenoreactive antigens are continually being discovered (198,199), from which new knockout and transgenic pigs may be generated. Although assessment of current genetically modified pigs combined with immunosuppressive therapy in NHP models is complex and expensive, we agree with the opinion that substantial results should be obtain in NHP models before clinic application. Data and experience based on studies with NHP models suggest that combining various genetically modified pigs with different immunosuppressive therapies is necessary for the effective transplantation of different organs. Therefore, determining the optimal genetically engineered organ-source pig and immunosuppressive regimen strategy in pig-to-NHP models is a key step toward further clinical study.\n\nQuestions regarding the regulatory challenges and ethical concerns regarding clinical xenotransplantation are being asked worldwide. In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration published comprehensive guidelines for xenotransplantation (http://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm). Scientists suggest that national regulatory authorities worldwide should reconsider guidelines and regulations regarding xenotransplantation so as to better enable design and safe conduction of informative clinical trials of xenotransplantation when supported by preclinical data (200). The current research makes some progress in meeting the criteria outlined by the recommendations of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation published in 2000 (201). However, it is unclear which regulatory agencies consider current evidence to be sufficient for moving forward with clinical xenotransplantation.\n\nAn alternative potential approach that could alleviate the current shortage of human organs for transplantation is to create human-animal chimeras through various techniques",

In recent decades, the ever increasing demand for clinical transplantation and shortage of allogeneic sources for patients on the waiting lists has led to considerable amounts of clinical and experimental research in order to overcome the barriers of xenotransplantation. However, a great number of ethical red tape and immunological roadblocks are yet to be surpassed. Graft rejection and failure to achieve successful long-term outcomes are the main issues to be addressed, as there are great disparities between MHCs of different species. Another concern is the risk of zoonotic infections, particularly unidentified viruses. In addition, xenotransplantation is by itself a controversial ethical issue and sometimes raises religious concerns because it involves sacrificing animals to harvest organs and tissues for human usage [16] .",

            "text": "Thus far, we have outlined concerns about AVC identified in the veterinary ethics literature, including poor quality of life or negative impacts on animal welfare, dysthanasia, increased caregiver burden, financial costs and impacts on accessibility, conflicts of interest and a lack of oversight for what amounts to experimentation. These concerns are not exclusive to AVC, but may be exacerbated in the context of AVC, for example due to its potential to be more invasive or more costly. Despite these concerns, we believe that individual animals, their owners and veterinary professionals and practices can benefit from improved treatment of companion animals through improved animal welfare, an enhanced human-animal bond, professional development, compassion satisfaction, and income. However, the concerns raised demonstrate that AVC, simply by virtue of being \"advanced\", is not enough to ensure \"good\" practice. Ethical AVC requires prospective and retrospective ethical review and thoughtful implementation. \n\nThe use of ethical frameworks, for example utilitarianism, the ethical matrix, and the four principles of biomedical ethics, prompt structured reflection on the potential harms relative to the potential benefits of healthcare [85,86]. For example, according to the first two principles of biomedical ethics, non-maleficence and beneficence [85], veterinary professionals should aim to minimise harms and maximise benefits associated with veterinary care. Indeed, Bley employs these principles as the basis of guidelines for clinical decision making in veterinary oncology [87]. According to this model, if treatment promotes a patient's basic needs and interests or increases wellbeing, and the frequency, durational and intensity of side effects is outweighed by these, the treatment can be justified on ethical grounds. \n\nFraser's \"practical\" ethic for animals requires that we provide good lives for animals in our care, treat suffering with compassion, be mindful of unseen or unintended harms and protect the life sustaining processes and balances of nature [88,89]. According to this framework, it is important that veterinary care is compatible with a good life (or a life worth living [90], or positive welfare [91]), aims to minimise suffering, has minimal negative unintended consequences, and is practiced sustainably.",

Regardless of general criticism, which can be attributed to many biological-technical dimensions, this treatment method raises many questions from both human-based and animalbased ethical points of view. \n\nIn the human-based side, it seems that from the viewpoint of precautionary principle and common good, it is better to keep this issue in the experimental level and clinical trials in a limited range due to lack of scientific certainties including diseases manifestations, virus transference from animal to human, its transfer-ence or spread in the society and also the degree of pain which is imposed on the patient and his/ her relatives. Following the steps of trials, with increasing human's knowledge and by finding solutions for existing problems on the way to transplant and also a deeper acceptance of this issue in the society, its side-effects are reduced as much as possible. \n\nFrom the animal-based side, the supporters of animal welfare school believe that starting this treatment process will destroy animal welfare from broad dimensions. This happens because its genetic structure is modified and therefore, the animal will not have the chance to live its instinct and will be deprived of the least factors necessary to live like being safe from pain and suffering. Therefore, even from the viewpoint of these philosophers who believe in the use of animals when necessary, this method at its present level is neither justified nor verified from the ethical point of view, but if its benefit and safety is proved, compromising the animal welfare to save a human life is justifiable. \n\nConsequently, considering the above mentioned facts, we can conclude that within the current situation, transgenic animals' organ transplantation into to human is not ethically justified; therefore, it needs to develop further.",

            "text": "The word \"Xenos\" is a Greek word meaning foreign or strange. Xenografting is heterologous transplantation involving the grafting of viable cells, tissues, or organs between two species (e.g., a dog and a pig). It is a cross-species transplantation method. The continued demand for viable organs, tissues, and cells brought about by end-stage organ failure and chronic diseases has been the driving force in this medical/scientific research and practice [25]. However, it has been confronted with the significant challenges of immunological barriers and ethical issues. Organ rejection is widespread in xenotransplantation. In humans, for instance, natural antibodies circulate in the blood, and these cause instant transplant rejection when the organdonating species is, for example, a pig. Again, the complement systems are often activated each time organs from pigs are grafted into humans or primates and are highly prone to profound system toxicity due to the central role played by the complement system in body homeostasis and metabolism [26]. The porcine complementary proteins are foreign to primate complement regulatory systems. Studies have shown that genetic engineering may be a way out of this complementary system challenge if pigs are genetically modified to contain some human complement regulatory proteins in their cells [27]. \n\nAnother fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans [28]. Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk [1]. The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28].",

            "text": "The common complications include coagulopathy, stemming from endothelial damage and acute rejection, further complicate the post-transplant scenario, necessitating ongoing research and development of strategies to mitigate these effects. \n\nViral infections, particularly those associated with porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) and porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV/PRV), pose significant risks for xenotransplantation. Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods. Consequently, developing future strategies to detect and eliminate these viruses is imperative to uphold the safety of both the graft and the recipient (28). \n\nAdditionally, the ethical landscape of xenotransplantation, encompassing animal rights, public attitudes, and regulatory milestones such as the FDA's 2022 approval of a pig-to-human heart transplant, presents ongoing challenges (29). The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30). Public acceptance and ethical considerations remain integral to the advancement and clinical application of xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for continued research, dialogue, and education in this evolving field. \n\nIn summary, xenotransplantation's journey towards becoming a viable clinical option is fraught with complex immunological, physiological, virological, and ethical challenges.",

            "text": "Motivated by persistent disparities in xenotransplantation regulatory posture among WHO member states, the first WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials was held in Changsha, China in 2008 under the leadership of WHO's Dr. Luc Noel [49]. The resulting Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 broadly inscribed 10 guiding principles and 20 recommendations for consideration by \"the WHO, Member States, Investigators, and proposers of clinical trials using xenotransplantation products\". This pivotal document provided evidence-based guidance as well as expert opinion regarding clinical trial design and was a landmark document in establishing guidance for xenotransplantation. It also strengthened the collaborative link between the IXA and TTS and the WHO. This guidance was approved by the WHA and published in 2009 [49,63]. The guiding principles addressed the ethical and safety considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, emphasized the need for rigorous scientific research, robust ethical standards, and the protection of public health and animal welfare, and advocated for transparent risk assessment, informed consent, and international collaboration to minimize potential risks and address ethical concerns. The recommendations provide detailed specific guidance on ensuring the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation practices, including the establishment of regulatory frameworks, the implementation of stringent biosafety measures, and the promotion of public and scientific dialogue to ensure responsible and ethical advancements in this field. \n\nIn 2011, the WHO and IXA organized the Second WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials, held at the WHO headquarters in Geneva [50]. This meeting focused on the refinement of guidance for infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and how best to respond appropriately to various clinical xenotransplant trial scenarios [50] significantly updating the 2001 document (WHO Guidance document on Xenogeneic Infection/Disease Surveillance and Response: A strategy for International Cooperation and Coordination) [24,33,50]. \n\nAs a direct outcome of the 2011 meeting, IXA infectious disease experts and other participants from the Consultation published a position paper in 2012 on xenotransplantation-associated infectious risks and proposed several preventative and mitigation strategies [24].",

The ethical issues relating to xenotransplantation include the risk/benefit to the individual, the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents crossing into humans, animal welfare and rights, issues of human and animal identity and concerns relating to fair allocation of organs and appropriate use of resources. These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician. In this review we will consider the virtues of justice, courage, temperance and practical wisdom, as well as the role of clinical curiosity, and their application to xenotransplantation. This provides an alternative approach for the clinical academic and others involved in the research to reflect on their practice.",

It is due to the fact that transplants of animal organs are currently in the experimental phase. The main current problem of transplantology is the shortage of organs; hence, the search for new solutions has become an everyday challenge. If a way for the human body to tolerate animal organs could be found, transplant medicine and humanity would be in a completely different place. The authors introduce the concepts of transplantation and xenotransplantation and their origins, then they raise ethical issues related to this type of organ transplantation. Finally, the authors conclude that xenotransplantations have a chance to be \u201cincorporated\u201d (back again) in the \u201ctransplants\u201d category when the experimental phase of xenotransplantation shifts to the implementation stage. Time will tell whether it will be possible.",

The local public debate on xenotransplantation began in the mid-1990s. According to Griessler, 'the debate was neither extensive nor continuous and only of concern to a small group of informed actors from research, parliament, public administration and stakeholder organizations' (Griessler 2012: 64). A diverse range of views on xenotransplantation was canvassed in the federal parliamentary debates. Though a proposed bill banning the procedure was introduced into the Swiss parliament, it was defeated towards the end of 1999. In the following year, at the 'PubliForum'-a consensus conference on transplantation medicine-a majority of lay participants affirmed their support for xenotransplantation research (Griessler 2012: 66). Notwithstanding public objections to xenotransplantation among sections of the community, the introduction of permissive laws sought to protect local research and economic interests in the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. The conflict between global science and local concerns regarding public health and patient safety have taken place in other parts of the world. As foreshadowed, I will explore comparable developments in Canada and Australia in the following two sub-sections of this paper.",

While the academic discussion on the ethical implications of XT has already started (Manesh et al, 2014), a broader societal debate is still lacking. This public deliberation may be more relevant for XT than for other biomedical innovations as it affects us as human beings and our relationship to animals. Therefore, the questions raised cannot be answered by reference to scientific evidence or ethical theories, but have to be deliberated in society. Not discussing these issues could result in an ethical rejection of promising XT therapies. However, public deliberation about XT is especially difficult, as the topic is hardly recognized among the general population owing to its novelty and biomedical complexity. We therefore organized a citizens' conference because it provides a useful tool to elicit well-informed and carefully reflected opinions on the topic. The results of the conference, a written evaluative statement on xenotransplantation, the so-called citizens' vote, has been published online, debated publicly, and was sent to healthcare politicians. The goals of the citizens' conference were to inform public debate and support policy and political decision-making. The results seem especially relevant in that it marks the first public consultation since the aforementioned research breakthrough in XT, thus reflecting the latest stage of research and development. Public deliberation on XT has been considered especially necessary because \"[t]o date [. . .] ethical thinking has largely been left in the hands of scientists\" (Jasanoff, 2018). For example, in Germany, there has hardly been any public debate on the current state of XT so far, nor has XT been considered by law or politics (Brown & Beynon-Jones, 2010). \n\n\"Yes, but. . .\"-the citizens' statement on xenotransplantation Eighteen citizens, recruited through a multistage process based on random and self-selection, met over three weekends, during which they received information about XT, listened to and discussed with experts from various disciplines, and engaged in intensive group deliberations.",

            "text": "On the animal side, a common motivation for genome editing was the possibility of lessening the environmental costs of animal agriculture by editing animals to emit fewer greenhouse gasses or to grow denser muscle tissue. In contrast, climate change was generally not cited as relevant to human genome editing, even though it is plausible that humans could also be genomically manipulated to help combat (or adjust to) climate changes (Lehmann 2017;Liao, Sandberg, and Roache 2012). On the human side, one common worry about enhancement was the issue of distributive justice. Some worried that enhancements might be unequally distributed to the wealthy, further compounding privileges. These concerns track similar issues raised by governance groups (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2017; European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies 2021). No similar justice concerns were raised for animals. This conspicuous absence raises the interesting question of whether animals can be the subjects of injustice, especially in the context of human use (Walker 2006). \n\nAs shown elsewhere (Waltz et al. 2024), genome editors and policymakers have varied views about enhancement, both conceptually and in terms of the ethical implications. When considering animal enhancement specifically, however, new ethical and conceptual issues arise (Chan 2009), some of which are relevant for our study. For example, it must be determined whether edits that do not improve the welfare of the individual animal but have other benefits ought to be considered enhancements (Gayozzo 2021;Shriver 2021). Animals edited to grow larger might be considered enhanced given that they can produce more meat, even if their greater size decreases their welfare. Considering how to conceptualize animal enhancement also raises important ethical questions about the prospect of \"disenhancement. \" Some have argued, for example, that to improve their welfare we have ethical reasons to edit animals to reduce certain capacities (Thompson 2008). In the context of intensive meat production farming, chickens, for example, might enjoy higher welfare if they are blind rather than sighted (Sand\u00f8e et al. 2014). Our data raises the question of whether, despite constituting a reduction in capacities, such edits could be considered an enhancement. \n\nWhile the issue of how to conceptualize animal enhancement is raised by our study, it had an important limitation with respect to this question.",

However, the development of new technologies without proper legislative preparation raises significant moral and ethical considerations. This paper provides an overview of the current state of xenotransplantology, highlighting its revolutionary potential alongside the moral dilemmas it entails.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess current social, ethical, religious, and legal trends regarding the issue of xenotransplantation.\nMaterials and methods: To obtain up-to-date information concerning trends in xenotransplantation, a review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, along with the latest legislative reports in both Europe and Poland, was performed.\nConclusions: Firstly, the authors briefly report on the current situation concerning transplantology and the widely spread organ donor crisis. Next, the issue of species boundaries and the moral status of non-human animals is addressed. The assessment of ethical implications of utilizing animals as organ donors is examined, along with the legal acts regulating this issue. Moreover, the authors attempt to evaluate the cultural and religious differences related to this concern. Furthermore, this study discusses the allocation and distribution of xenotransplants, considering issues of justice, fairness, and access to this innovative medical technology. Lastly, the paper delves into the risks and uncertainties associated with xenotransplantation, including the possibility of cross-species disease transmission and intensified course of organ rejection disease.",

Although potential harms of pig-to-human xenotransplantation exist, such as cross-species infection, transplant rejection, psychological harm, risks of wear and tear and threats to altruism, these harms may be mitigated through appropriate strategies. We address the objection that xenotransplantation is unnatural. We respond that the sense in which xenotransplantation is unnatural is unclear, and moreover, does not demonstrate that it is wrong. Overall, we claim that the benefits of pig-to-human xenotransplantation are likely to outweigh the harms, if appropriate steps are taken. Genetically modified pigs offer hope for a vast supply of organs for transplant in patients, along with a potentially avoidable risk of transplant rejection and disease transmission.",

            "text": "According to many respondents, the procedure was unwarranted, no alternative treatments were sought, nothing was known about the parents' informed consent, and doctor Bailey was reluctant to work with the media (Borowiec 2019;Tilney 2019). \n\nIn Poland, since 2003 the Institute of Zootechnics in Balice has been conducting research on transgenic pigs, supervised by prof. Zygmunt Smor\u0105g. The project, ordered by the Ministry of Science and Informatisation, involves 11 research teams representing various fields, including molecular biology, embryology, virology, immunology, as well as transplantation surgery. The project aims to breed transgenic pigs with an edited human gene in order to crossbreed the animals to obtain the best possible transplantation organ, and thus, to lower the immunological barrier between humans and pigs (Smor\u0105g and S\u0142omski 2005). So far, the outcome of the project is the TG1154 transgenic hog, whose semen is used to inseminate and reproduce subsequent specimens. Professor Smor\u0105g stresses the importance of various procedures and requirements regarding how xenotransplantation products are obtained. A major requisite is the source of organs and their effectiveness which leads to appointing a specific series number, as well as their safety with regard to their maximum and documented sterility (Smor\u0105g 2006). Indisputably, the advantage of xenotransplantation is that it responds to the human organ shortage, in addition to the possibility of thoroughly testing, supervising and fully controlling a specific graft (i.e. its size and genetic profile), as well as specifically planning transplantation procedures. \n\nApart from biotechnical, medical and organisational aspects, xenotransplantation involves social and ethical concerns. By their very nature, xenotransplantation gives rise to moral dilemmas. Most people approach the use of heterogenous organs with reserve. Some fear the existence of an alien, heterogenous organ inside the human body: the most perfect, most advanced evolutionary organism. Others are simply afraid of rejection or inefficiency of the animal graft. Western European societies clearly differ-entiate between organs in respect to their species of origin.",

            "text": "Animals are a potential source of donated organs. Experiments with baboon hearts and pig liver transplants have received extensive media attention in the past. One cautionary argument in opposition to the use of animal organs concerns the possibility of transferring animal bacteria and viruses to humans. Some argue that xenotransplantation is the only www.intechopen.com potential way of addressing this shortage. As immunological barriers to xenotransplantation are better understood, those hurdles are being addressed through genetic engineering of donor animals and the development of new drugs therapies [Starzl etal 1964& Grant etal 2001. The focus of ethical attention has changed from the moral correctness of using animals for research/therapy to an increasingly appreciated danger of the establishment and spread of xenozoonses in recipients, their contacts and the general public. There are a number of reasons for not using subhuman primates for xenotransplantation, including their closeness to humans, the likelihood of passing on infections, their availability (gorillas, chimpanzees), their slow breeding and the expense of breeding them under specified pathogen free conditions. The pig, although domesticated and familiar, is too distant to evoke the same feeling as we have for primates, has the correct size organs, is probably less likely to pass infections, breeds rapidly and is not endangered; moreover, millions of them are eaten every year. Although drawing ethical conclusions is difficult at the stage of knowledge and debate, it seems acceptable to manipulate pigs genetically and to proceed to using their organs for xenotransplantation trials when infection control measures and the scientific base justify it [Bukler etal 1999& Sim etal 1999. The use of pigs in Muslim countries would be more controversial and disruptive although it is acceptable by Islamic religion in case of a real need and when there is no alternative [Rahman 1998]. In this case the question of informed consent is likely to be ambiguous and awkward. It might end up more of a binding legal contract than consent, as we understand it now. Xenotransplantation is also unlikely to cost less than or significantly alleviate the shortage of cadaveric organs in the short term. The international dimension of the risk of infection is becoming obvious, but there has so far been no effort to",

            "text": "In contrast to this, the opinions about xenotransplantation and the precautionary principle are divergent. For the activists, xenotransplantation represents an unacceptable risk, whereas the opponents fear that a life-saving method is prevented by ill-founded concerns. \n\nOriginally, xenotransplantation, i.e. the transplantation of animal, especially porcine cellular, tissue and organ grafts to humans, has been deemed a promising option to over-come the permanent shortage of donor organs. However, there are presently three important reasons being opposed to its introduction in practice: the immunological rejections against porcine xenotransplants; the long-term physiological compatibility and thus functionality of xenotransplants in the human organism; and of late, the potential risk of damage by transmission of infectious agents present in pigs [24,25]. Solving the well-known problems of the rejection and of the compatibility is essential for the feasibility of xenotransplantation. But stepwise progresses such the production of new transgenic pigs [26] raise hope that this might be possible in the long run. In contrast to this, the question on the microbiological safety has been characterized by complete uncertainty of the risk. \n\nAt present, about 25 different viruses are identified such as swine hepatitis E virus, hendravirus, porcine circoviruses type I and II, two newly identified herpesviruses, porcine cytomegalovirus and in particular, pig endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) [27]. Whereas most of the microorganisms may be eliminated by specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal husbandry and breed selection [25], PERVs represent a special problem. \n\nPERVs are integrated in the porcine genome and are thus transmitted to the recipient. They are related to retrovirus known to induce leukaemia and immune deficiency syndromes. Consequently, the question arises whether PERVs might also become pathogenic in humans.",

Attitudes were shaped by age, marital status, social engagement, religious beliefs and attitudes toward deceased organ transplants. Respondents from Honduras and Guatemala were significantly more in favor of xenotransplantation [13]. In a separate study of Spanish veterinary students, researchers found that respondents were generally in favor of xenotransplantation [14]. \n\nBlack and white patients with kidney disease and Black and white parents of children with congenital heart disease did not differ in attitudes toward xenotransplantation of hearts. But Black kidney patients were less likely than white kidney patients to accept porcine xenotransplantation in part due to psychosocial concerns about the effect of pig xenotransplantation on the recipient's personality and social interactions. Overall acceptance of pig kidney transplants was still high among Black respondents, with 70% responding favorably [15]. \n\nAttitudes toward xenotransplantation in Asia are influenced unfavorably by Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism, but seem to be shifting as scientists in Korea and China become more involved in research on pig xenotransplants of kidneys, corneas and islet cells [16]. \n\nAnimal rights remain a concern. Religious leaders discussed the need for 'Stewardship over creation,' avoiding cruelty to animals in frivolous research. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an organization opposed to animal experimentation, argued that reports on the xenotransplantation of pig heart and pig kidney 'should serve as reminders that animal-tohuman transplants are unethical, dangerous and a tremendous waste of resources.' The group proposed that presumed consent laws, in which people must opt-out of being considered an organ donor rather than opting in, would make more human organs available [17].",

            "text": "Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38] This is not merely an ethical dilemma that trades life for life but rather requires multiple animals to be used and killed for every human life potentially extended. As Jan Dutkiewicz writes, \"embracing xenotransplantation involves embracing the commodification, modification, and slaughter of animals on an unknown scale.\" [39] he 3Rs-replacement, reduction, and refinement-are pioneering principles of animal use in medical research and testing. [40] In line with these general principles, U.S. federal agencies require researchers to consider alternatives to animal use; [41] but this framework is notoriously subjective, allowing researchers and oversight committees to justify any number of animals and any methods of research on the grounds of necessity for obtaining the knowledge sought. A more comprehensive framework of principles for animal research ethics was recently proposed based on social benefit and animal welfare. [42] Included in this framework is the Principle of No Alternative Method, a more robust version of the 3Rs notion of replacement: \"use of animal subjects must be the sole ethically acceptable way to address a research problem whose solution offers the prospect of a social benefit\", ( [42] p.6). According to this principle, because there are feasible alternatives for addressing transplant needs that do not cause harm to animals, those alternatives should be prioritized. Thus, because pigs are sentient animals with moral status, and because there is a wealth of strategies beyond xenotransplantation for solving the organ shortage that have yet to receive investment to match their potential, those alternatives should be pursued.",

More specifically, gene-editing technologies combined with cross-breeding are employed to produce personalized organ generation. The generated organ in tandem with immunosuppression and gene reprogramming constitutes the step preceding xenotransplantation. 7 In the technical field, the formidable barriers to overcome are as follows: a) hyperacute rejection and acute humoral xenograft rejection, happening from minutes to hours posttransplantation; b) initial cellular xenograft dysfunction, presenting from minutes to hours post-transplantation; and c) acute humoral rejection, attributed to coagulation dysregulation and elicited antibody immunity, presenting from days to weeks post-transplantation. 8,9 Nonetheless, even the supporters of cardiac xenotransplantation admit that this method is indicated in selected cases. Pierson et al 10 defined the criteria for cardiac xenotransplantation consisting of 4 principal categories: the risk of allograft failure due to immunologic factors, contraindications for the ventricular assist device, adult congenital heart diseases, and severe biventricular failure without established end-organ failure. \n\nIndubitably, the enthusiasm for new methods that could offer solutions in the treatment of end-stage cardiac failure is elevated. Nevertheless, the technical barriers notwithstanding, ethical parameters should be considered. First and foremost, the transmission of zoonotic viral diseases is a complication that cannot be neglected, especially after the disastrous experience of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In other words, are we ready to take the risk of performing xenotransplantation even though the risk of a new pandemic may arise? Is it ethical to risk the creation of new zoonotic diseases in order to treat cardiac failure in some patients?",

Given the potential for such advances to revolutionize how NHPs are used in future research, and the high societal concern about the use of these highly sentient animals in scientific procedures generally (European Commission, 2006;Crettaz von Roten, 2012;Clemence, 2019), it is surprising there have been few focused attempts by regulatory or research funding bodies to examine the ethical issues associated with GA NHPs. Nor has there been a concerted effort to engage with the general public, which ultimately funds most of the work, to ascertain its views on the acceptability of otherwise of this new NHP research paradigm. \n\nTwo forums which have considered the ethical issues are the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) and the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS). In 2016, the European Commission tasked its Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) to update an opinion on the need for NHP research and alternatives. With regard to transgenic NHPs, the Working Group, of which this author was a member, called for an examination of \"the scientific and ethical implications of such research to determine if it should be allowed in the EU and, if so, within what constraints\" (Vermeire et al., 2017: 64). The Commission passed this to EGE, an independent multidisciplinary body, but it has not yet reported on its deliberations (Moedas, 2018). In late 2018, the NAS held a workshop to explore the scientific opportunities afforded by new transgenic and chimeric NHP models in neuroscience (Bain et al., 2019), along with a related workshop on the care, use and welfare of marmosets used in gene editing-based biomedical research (Anestidou & Johnson, 2019). Both workshop reports give some attention to ethics, though not always focused on GA NHPs specifically. In this paper, I summarize the main animal welfare concerns and ethical issues, and highlight the need for appropriate oversight, taking an international perspective.",

            "text": "We also aim to apply lessons learned through historical analysis to reveal bioethical concerns that are critically underdiscussed. Organ transplantation appears poised on the precipice of spectacular, paradigmatic change. However, little has been done to show that xenotransplantation will not also fall victim to the issues currently troubling traditional organ transplantation. Without this analysis, researchers, physicians, and patients may adopt ostensible solutions plagued by the same problems they were meant to solve. If the set of reasons concerning why so many would-be transplant recipients suffer and die are connected to a broader network of social and cultural considerations, it would follow that simply replacing human donors with nonhuman donors would fail to rectify the many problems within today's transplant practices. \n\nUsing the current shortfalls of traditional organ transplantation as a justification for shifting to xenotransplantation leaves us vulnerable to repeating past mistakes, particularly when we discover that the rhetoric around xenotransplantation research today paints an alarmingly optimistic, solutionoriented picture. Moreover, xenotransplantation has not yet engaged with a number of critical ethical issues, such as how human subjects will be used as the proving ground for this therapy. Broad and thorough bioethical outlining can protect against a similar fate befalling xenotransplantation practice in the future. In other words, if we work to synergize historical and bioethical perspectives today, we may generate positive downstream effects on researchers, patients, and non-human animals within a new biomedical system of relationships and practices. \n\nOne tool at our disposal for generating these positive effects is bioethics, one of the most important institutions in biomedical research for helping to orchestrate, buffer, and rebuff the complex web of interactions guiding medical research. This system includes a robust legal framework guiding research and protecting patients, a governing and review body present at most research institutions, and an informal network of academics, scientists, lawyers, researchers, theologians, philosophers, and, indeed, the public itself. All individuals and groups involved are tasked with protecting the most vulnerable in society while biomedical research continues to seek new heights in knowledge and understanding. \n\nNevertheless, bioethics was born in response to history.",

            "text": "In the late 1990s there were serious concerns about public health risks associated with xenotransplantation, especially the transmission of animal infections to humans.This included both the risk of infecting the transplant recipients themselves, and that infections originating in animals could mutate in an individual with a weakened immune system, placing other individuals at risk.In the worst-case scenario, this could lead to pandemics.Some commentators called for a moratorium on all xenotransplantation until these concerns could be addressed [12].However, most official reports called for a careful development of xenotransplantation with strong oversight mechanisms, and stringent quality controls at all stages of development.Examples of these reports include the 1996 Nuffield Council's report on xenotransplantation [12], the 1996 report of the US National Academies [13], and a WHO Consultation on Xenotransplantation in 1997 [14].All of these groups highlighted the risk of disease transmission, and recommended that national authorities should develop national guidelines and/or regulations that would set standards and rules for xenotransplantation activities.There was some disagreement about whether there should be national review and approval of all xenotransplantation activities because of the special nature of the risks.Some argued that local ethics reviews would be sufficient.However, even when this was deemed sufficient, local review committees were expected to consult experts, and always follow national guidelines or regulations.These reports also recommended setting up national databases of transplant recipients so that they could be followed and monitored systematically for the rest of their lives for any infections or other adverse events resulting from the transplant.\n\nA number of countries have since introduced regulatory frameworks or guidelines for xenotransplantation.The US Food and Drugs Agency (FDA) has set out detailed and strict rules to minimize public health risks [15,16].These rules recognize that xenotransplantation involves standardized production of biological material that has inherent risks to the recipients, and that standards therefore need to be developed for the production and approval of such products, similar to those for pharmaceutical products.The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 clearly states that government regulations \"should have a legal basis with powers to ban unregulated procedures and enforce compliance with regulatory requirements.\"",

            "text": "One of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in xenotransplantation is the selection of patients for clinical trials. Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19]. \n\nCardiac xenotransplantation is also actively being explored for pediatric patients-a population in which few therapeutic options exist at all. Successful xenotransplantation could represent a bridge to allotransplantation or a potential long-term solution for this vulnerable population. Genetically modified pig hearts offer considerable promise in alleviating growing waitlists and reducing high mortality rates among pediatric patients [20]. However, the ethical challenges surrounding pediatric xenotransplantation are complex. Issues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials. Efforts to address these challenges include developing transparent patient selection frameworks prioritizing medical need, equitable access, and rigorous informed consent processes, particularly for vulnerable groups such as pediatric patients [21]. By integrating these considerations, the field can progress in a way that balances innovation with justice and beneficence",

            "text": "Philosophers have long debated whether it is immoral to eat meat. A growing number of ethicists claim that it is not moral to eat meat, to the extent that animals are sentient beings (as Bentham famously asserted, \"the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" [109], and furthermore, meat is not a true necessity for human diet. Another line of reasoning (famously advanced by ethicist Tom Regan [110]) posits that even if the animals are killed painlessly (as may be the case in xenotransplantation), it is still immoral to do so, to the extent that animals have rights, and killing them for the purpose of human exploitation violates their right to life. \n\nBut xenotransplantation is in one dimension different from eating meat, as this technological prospect may indeed be a necessity for the survival of terminally ill people. In this case, xenotransplantation may be more akin to animal experimentation, to the extent that it is a procedure that entails the killing of animals in order to save human beings. Philosophers also debate the ethics of animal experimentation. Some ethicists (such as Gary Francione [111]) think that animal experiments are never ethically permissible; others (such as Carl Cohen [112]) think we should prioritize human suffering above animal suffering (since animals do not have the same moral status, given their limited capacity for moral duties), and therefore, experiments are permissible; yet others (such as Peter Singer in his more recently revised views) are overall very skeptical of the moral permissibility of animal experimentation, but remain open to the possibility, provided the benefits truly outweigh the harms, considering all sentient beings involved in the procedures [113]. \n\nWhile ethical discussions on animal experimentation have been happening for quite some time, xenotransplantation presents a new challenge. For now, it is difficult to predict what the eventual outcome of this ethical discussion will be.",

Ethical issues with clinical xenotransplantation have been described for decades, largely centering on animal welfare, the risks posed to the recipient, and public health risks posed by potential spread of xenozoonosis. Much less attention has been given to considerations relating to potentially elevated risks faced by those who may care for or otherwise have close contact with xenograft recipients. This paper examines the ethical and logistical issues raised by the potential exposure to xenozoonotic disease faced by close contacts of xenotransplant recipients\u2014defined herein as including but not limited to caregivers, household contacts, and sexual partners\u2014which warrants special attention given their increased risk of exposure to infection compared to the general public. We discuss implications of assent or consent by these close contacts to potentially undergo, along with the recipient, procedures for infection screening and possible quarantine. We then propose several options and recommendations for operationalizing oversight of xenotransplantation clinical trials that could account for and address close contacts\u2019 education on and agency regarding the risk of xenozoonosis.",

If, as leaders of the scientific community have repeatedly affirmed, scientific progress is absolutely dependent upon animal use, it surely behooves that community to address societal ethical concerns attendant upon animal use. \n\nI have also indicated in our discussion that the concept of animal telos is presuppositional to the development of animal ethics as I have formulated it, and society seems to agree. The question then obviously arises as to whether genetic modification, which can readily be seen as effecting both major and minor changes in telos, is morally acceptable. This is certainly not the place for a full discussion of this vexatious issue. But I have argued that as long as telos changes do not negatively affect the animals' lives, i.e., that genetically modified animals are no worse off than their unmodified predecessors, and ideally are better off, there is nothing morally wrong with creating such genetic modifications. In other words, one foundational issue in genetically engineering animals is providing assurance that genetic modification occasions no harm, and ideally, as is the case in genetic modification to prevent disease or ameliorate genetic defects, the animals will be better off in virtue of such modification. Such considerations will not be addressed until such time as the thinking of scientists is radically changed in order to assure that ethics enters into standard scientific theory and practice, and this can only be accomplished by revolutionary modification of science education.",

            "text": ": Xenotransplantation, involving animal organ transplantation into humans to address the human organ shortage, has been studied since the 17th century. Early attempts to obtain organs from animals such as goats, dogs, and non-human primates proved unsuccessful. In the 1990s, scientists agreed that pigs were the most suitable donor animals for xenotransplantation. However, immune rejection between pig and human has hindered the application. To overcome these challenges, researchers developed genetically modified pigs that deactivate xenoreactive antigen genes and express human protective genes. These advances extended xenograft survival from days to years in non-human primates, resulting in the first human heart xeno-transplant trial. Using genetically engineered pigs for the organ shortage is promising. This review provides an overview of potential incompatibilities of immunogenicity and functional proteins related to xenotransplantation between humans and pigs. Furthermore, it elucidates possible approaches for multiplex gene modification to breed better-humanized pigs for clinical xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "A range of technologies can be used to change the genetics of an organism (referred to as gene editing, genetic modification, etc.; collectively referred to here as genetic engineering or GE). Proponents of these technologies have suggested that these can be used to address a variety of societal and environmental challenges, including human health and environmental concerns [1,2]. In farming, applications have been proposed to improve disease resistance in animals, reduce agricultural pollution and improve animal welfare [3,4]. Some research has focused on what GE means for the animals involved and what people consider to be acceptable for animals. Early research focused on the negative effects on animals such as genetic disorders and development abnormalities [e.g. 5] and the role humans ought to play in modifying animal genomes [i.e. \"playing God\"; 6]. However, much of this scholarship took place before the development of technologies that can target specific genes [e.g. CRISPR/Cas9; 7]; such technologies are considered more precise, changing some ethical considerations [8]. In response to the growing discussion regarding ethical considerations about this technology, [9] conducted a systematic review of reasons given for and against gene editing in non-human animals. Their findings indicate that the reasons against gene editing included concerns about environmental safety, animal health and public acceptability, while the most cited reason in favor of this approach was the potential to improve human health (although this improvement focused on the application of gene drives to control vector-borne diseases). \n\nA large body of research now exists on public attitudes specifically towards foods resulting from GE. Researchers have reviewed behavioral processes that can lead to acceptance, including perceptions of risk and benefit, trust, knowledge, valuation and purchasing decisions [10,11]. For example, one review reported that genetically modified (GM) meat was perceived as less acceptable than GM oil [11]. Others have evaluated consumer and societal attitudes toward genetically engineered food [12] and, like [10], identified that risk and benefit perceptions and intention to purchase as well as awareness, beliefs, concerns and emotions play a role in determining attitudes. In another instance, [13] also reviewed risk, benefit and trust perceptions, but also considered perceptions of \"naturalness\" and technology use in food.",

            "text": "This work does not touch on the pharmaceutical course and immunological therapies that need to be developed or altered to prepare human and animal donors for transplantation. Additionally, this does not include the pharmaceutical supports that will need to be developed to prevent the rejection of the organs throughout the recipient's life. Getting the genetic basis of the porcine donor is just one step of many that will need to be perfected to make xenotransplantation a legitimate realworld solution to the crisis of demand for organ transplants. Notably, the xenotransplantation team at the heart of Mr. Bennett's story recalled the difficult biomedical journey that resulted in a transplant-ready xenoheart as \"based on trialand-error over a decade\" with \"many dozens of experiments carried out\" 28 . \n\nSurmounting one of the immunological hurdles previously preventing xenotransplantation from becoming a mainstay of biomedical practice is undoubtedly a result to be celebrated. However, it seems likely that the biomedical focus on donor-to-host immunological response has overshadowed other serious bioethical concerns. Bennett's new xenoheart was not the product of a clinical study. Instead, as stated, it resulted from a unique, singular approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for an operation on an otherwise poor candidate for traditional transplantation with no alternatives. Other ethical treatments of the Bennett case similarly focus on the welfare of donor animals and the prevalence of zoonosis. In the latter case, the emphasis is still on \"xenogeneic diseases\" and how to account for informed consent given the \"Ulysses contract,\" or a contractual agreement that \"waives the right to withdraw from the clinical trial\" 35 . Discussion of whether Bennett ought to have been the target of this xenotransplantation team, given his markedly vulnerable status, is conspicuously absent. \n\nIt is not necessarily the number of studies conducted that will automatically confirm or deny the permissibility of xenotransplantation from a bioethical perspective. Instead, to be seen as a safe and effective solution to the shortage of human organs for organ transplantation, xenotransplantation science needs to grapple with a greater variety of ethical considerations.",

            "text": "The improved life expectancy of humans over the past decades has increased the prevalence of a growing number of chronic diseases 1 . The increasing application of organ transplantation, the last resort and definitive treatment for endstage organ failure, has resulted in a disparity in the supply and demand for such organs 1 . Therefore, xenotransplantation has become an appealing solution to overcome this obstacle 2 . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines xenotransplantation as \"any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs\" 3 . Currently, xenotransplant use has been reported mainly for the kidneys, hearts, livers, skin, and corneas 4 . \n\nPigs are the species of choice to harvest organs for xenotransplantation, as they have anatomically similar organs to humans and are suitable for genetic modification 5 . They are highly bred and often consumed, clearing the way for the ethical decision to use pig organs to treat human diseases. Although the genetic discrepancies between humans and pigs are greater than those of primates, the use of primate organs is not sustainable for ethical reasons and because most primates are considered endangered 5 . Furthermore, primate organs have a substantial chance of carrying viruses that can infect humans 5 . Hence, genetic engineering techniques have been developed to decrease porcine and human genetic dissimilarities 1 , paving the road for the usage of pig organs for xenotransplants. Indeed, recent studies described two successful cases of kidney transplants from pigs in brain-dead patients 6 , and another reported a successful case of a heart transplant from a pig to a human 7 . These breakthroughs marked a great milestone for the field of xenotransplantation. \n\nThe main obstacle facing xenotransplants is immunological reactions. Although the mechanism behind hyperacute rejection (HAR) in the xenograft is well defined, the mechanisms of acute cellular rejection are not fully understood 2 .",

Griffith and scientific/program director Muhammad Mohiuddin [3], successfully transplanted a gene-edited pig heart into a patient with end-stage cardiac failure at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.The donor pigs had 10 genetic modifications.Four genes were knocked out or inactivated, including one encoding a molecule (Nglycolylneuraminic acid) that causes an aggressive human rejection response and a growth gene (growth hormone receptor) that was knocked out to prevent the pig's heart from growing after transplantation.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that animal viruses can be controlled with the use of effective measures, including the breeding of source animals in biosecure isolation conditions, regular testing of donor animals, and the execution of long-term follow-ups after clinical xenotransplantations [2,27,47]. \n\nFor endogenous retrovirus that cannot be solved by the above methods, gene editing can be used as an effective strategy. The current research studies focus more on porcine endogenous retroviruses. CRISPR/Cas9, a revolutionary gene editing technology that allows the custom modification of almost any part of any genome with unmatched precision and accuracy, has stimulated interest in the field as it offers the possibility to genetically engineer porcine organs and tissues that are virtually riskfree of endogenous porcine retrovirus transmissions [16,30].",

However, at times, there may be conflicts between the interests of animal caregivers or owners, the interests of veterinarians and the interests of animals. We provide an overview of why and how veterinary ethics is taught to veterinary students, as well as providing a context for thinking about veterinary ethical challenges and animal welfare issues. We argue that veterinarians are ethically obliged to speak up and ask questions when problems arise or are seen and provide a series of clinical case examples in which there is scope for veterinarians to improve animal welfare by \u2018speaking up\u2019. Abstract Although expectations for appropriate animal care are present in most developed countries, significant animal welfare challenges continue to be seen on a regular basis in all areas of veterinary practice. Veterinary ethics is a relatively new area of educational focus but is thought to be critically important in helping veterinarians formulate their approach to clinical case management and in determining the overall acceptability of practices towards animals. An overview is provided of how veterinary ethics are taught and how common ethical frameworks and approaches are employed\u2014along with legislation, guidelines and codes of professional conduct\u2014to address animal welfare issues. Insufficiently mature ethical reasoning or a lack of veterinary ethical sensitivity can lead to an inability or difficulty in speaking up about concerns with clients and ultimately, failure in their duty of care to animals, leading to poor animal welfare outcomes. A number of examples are provided to illustrate this point. Ensuring that robust ethical frameworks are employed will ultimately help veterinarians to \u201cspeak up\u201d to address animal welfare concerns and prevent future harms.",

            "text": "That being said, we recognise that xenotransplantation may represent an opportunity for many patients to alleviate themselves from feelings of guilt towards donors and their relatives, as well as from the realisation that another human has given their life for them. Xenotransplantation raises expectations (Brown and Michael 2003), including the hope to alleviate the organ shortage and the hope among chronically ill and dying patients for a prolonged life. This may lead them to opt for experimental treatments (a facet of this involves the necessary infringement on what is considered a patient's autonomy (Strand 2023). One of the challenges that patients and their relatives may face can be seen in the dual construction of the xenotransplanted body (viewed as sacred and profane, subjective and depersonalised, both similar and different from the 'donor' species; organs as essential and disposable, simultaneously vitalistic and mechanical). These complexities may pose a potential burden for those affected (potential and actual recipients) necessitating careful consideration and grappling with these intricate aspects. \n\nMany factors remain speculative, such as the potential impact of organ transplant commodification on society and the symbolic value of the organ as a gift. Companies producing genetically engineered pigs for xenotransplantation are already implementing different strategies for their 'products'. Revivicor, which provided the porcine hearts for the first cardiac xenotransplants, and eGenesis, which respectively provided the first kidney, each implemented 10 or more genetic modifications to the source pigs. Meanwhile, scientists in Germany Current controversy advocate that fewer genetic edits to the source pigs are a safer and more reproducible approach (Kemter et al 2020;Wolf et al 2023). These competing approaches have the potential to develop into national market strategies as companies work to develop different models of genetically modified pigs as new biocommodities. This could lead to challenges in decisionmaking options for xenotransplantation patients, and is likely to pose new regulatory challenges (Cook et al 2013).",

Yet, the precise basis of the recipient's death continues to be uncertain and remains under evaluation. 16 The porcine donor in this case had 10 genetic modulations (knock out of three porcine genes that promote hyperacute rejection, knock out of one gene that causes continued organ growth, and six human genes that promote tolerance (rejection reduction) were inserted (knock-in) in the porcine genome. 17 owever, despite these advances and optimism, bioethical issues related to xenotransplantation remain polemic and some issues deserve particular attention. Clinical application of innovation such as xenotransplantation raises questions concerning the balance between beneficence, individual autonomy and the recognition of possible damage to society and the environment. 18,19 The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. 18,19 he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation. 20,21  recipients and their contacts probably will need lifelong surveillance to detect and treat any unexpected disease early and protect society as a whole. 20,21 he appropriate care of the swine that will be a donor in the xenotransplantation is another important bioethical issue.",

            "text": "In 1995, I published what I believe to be the first book ever written on the social and ethical issues associated with the genetic engineering of animals, entitled The Frankenstein Thing: Ethical and Social Issues in the Genetic Engineering of Animals [1]. I used the iconic image of the Frankenstein monster as the symbol for society's view of biotechnology. I disambiguated three different aspects of the myth that I called \"There are certain things humans were not meant to do\", \"Rampaging monsters\", and \"The plight of the creature\". Aspect one referred to the widespread belief, primarily for religious reasons, that certain areas should not be studied. Aspect two referred to dangers attendant on human manipulation of species. Aspect three referred to the suffering of the created being. All of these are strikingly present in the issue of using animal organs for xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile aspect one was of great social prominence, I did not see it as a genuine ethical issue, though much of society surely did. I in fact enunciated what I called \"a Gresham's law for ethics\". Recall that Gresham's law affirms that \"bad money drives good money out of circulation\". For example, after World War I in Germany it took a wheelbarrow full of deutschemarks to buy a loaf of bread, so devalued was the currency. In such a situation, no one paid off major debts in gold, but rather in worthless currency. Similarly, I argued that \"bad ethics drives good ethics out of circulation\", since such aspect one claims as \"genetic engineering violates God's will\" are far \"sexier\" than genuine ethical issues. After Dolly the cloned sheep was announced, for example, a Time/Warner survey conducted the next week revealed that 75% of the U.S. public believed that the creation of Dolly violated God's will. \n\nAspect two referred to various kinds of danger or harm associated with genetic engineering; for example, environmental dangers or the potential for new pathogens. While certainly counting as ethical issues, they were equally matters of prudence. Aspect three, the effect of genetic engineering on the welfare of the animals engineered, was a truly ethical issue, as it almost invariably pitted the well-being of the animals against human well-being.",

Whether or not animals should be used in research, their welfare, sufferings, and wellbeing were debated throughout the world. In India many plants and animals are linked to religious beliefs and are respected and worshipped for their contribution in the life of human beings. \n\nLikewise usage of embryonic stem cells faced controversies and concerns. Protestants agree to have stem cell research under strict public regulations. Many however are opposed to embryonic stem cell research as it destroys the embryo. The debates and issues surrounding the stem cell are all centered on the potential source of these cells. Embryonic stem cell usage either is prohibited or is under strict public regulation. Somatic stem cells and dedifferentiated somatic cells can be used for therapy. \n\nThe public support for xenotransplantation was low due to safety issues with fear of spread of unknown contaminants. However, some xenogeneic tissue-engineered products are now available to treat dermal wounds and burn patients. The usage of biological weapons (use of living organism or its product for human killing) in war is presently banned.",

            "text": "This analysis estimated only financial savings and did not address quality of life issues or years of productive life reclaimed. Although xenotransplantation's potential for positive benefits to individuals and society was a primary driver for the clinical research community, the attention of the public health community was captured more by concern for the potential for unintended negative consequences. Xenotransplantation is intended to benefit the health of individuals by replacing nonfunctioning or malfunctioning human cells, tissues, or organs with functioning nonhuman animals cells, tissue, or organs. However, the implantation, transplantation, or infusion of living nonhuman tissue into humans for therapeutic purposes has an associated potential to also transfer infections across species lines into humans. Because xenotransplantation applications breech normal host defenses and are frequently accompanied by pharmacological immune suppression, xenotransplantation may be ideally suited to have the unintended consequence of introducing new infections into the human recipients. The potential for implanted living nonhuman animal cells to also transfer infections across species lines into the human population (xenozoonosis or xenogeneic infections) was a major concern. Zoonotic infections occur in nature and produce disease in individuals and epidemics in human populations. Examples of zoonotic epidemics include the 1993 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome outbreak in the American southwest 11 and the epidemic of encephalitis that followed the introduction of West Nile virus into New York in 1999. 12 Zoonotic infection of humans by avian influenza viruses caused the largest recorded pandemic in human history, the Influenza Pandemic of 1918. 13 AIDS, now understood to have resulted from the introduction of a simian immunodeficiency virus infection across species lines into humans, 14 has gone through all these stages and is no longer a zoonosis, an epidemic, or a pandemic. DOI:10.1002/MSJ AIDS now is simply an endemic infection affecting all human populations throughout the world, and as much as any single force in this century, it is reshaping the world. \n\nThis then is the primary basis for public health interest in xenotransplantation and related biotechnologies.",

            "text": "Therefore, it contains the risk of the so-called \"therapeutic misconception\", a phenomenon during which the study participants have no other available therapeutic options and believe that they will be personally benefited therapeutically by the clinical trial rather than they will help to generate knowledge and advance the science for certain diseases [40]. In view of that, the risk of therapeutic misconception must be taken into consideration during the informed consent procedure and ensure that participants in the trial fully understand the true benefits of research. \n\nSome scientists have even raised the question about whether it is ethically acceptable to include children in a first-in-human organoid transplantation clinical trial and under which conditions. Of course, these would be children who suffer from severe conditions that predominantly affect children, such as metabolic diseases [41]. In such cases, additional ethical concerns should be considered including the principle of subsidiarity, which demands that clinical research involving children is only permissible if the clinical study cannot be performed in adults. Such first-in-children clinical trial for liver organoid transplantation could be ethically justified provided that certain guidelines are followed and various safeguards are met [41]. \n\nFinally, it is worth noting that organoid transplantation may offer an alternative to xenotransplantation [42]. Xenotransplantation is the transplantation, implantation or infusion of living cells, tissues or whole organs from animals to humans and has been examined as a possible solution to the scarcity of human organ donors, to the illegal trade of organs from living donors and the use of condemned prisoners as donors, which is permitted in some countries. It involves genetic modification of animals (e.g., pigs and non-human primates) so that their organs cause a reduced immune response when transplanted into humans, raising arguments on the welfare of the donor animals. In addition, xenotransplantation encompasses serious safety issues, because of the possibility to transmit infectious agents from animals to human recipients threatening the recipient's health but also public health. Perhaps more importantly, transplanting animal organs into humans raises concerns over whether this changes the human nature of the recipient and whether it violates the integrity of the human species. These issues result in reduced societal acceptability of xenotransplantation.",

Yang et. al recently demonstrated the effectiveness of genome-wide inactivation of porcine endogenous retroviruses in preventing zoonotic infection in porcine renal epithelial cells. Through use of the CRISPR-cas9 system, researchers were able to remove 25 copies of porcine endogenous retroviruses from the genomes of pigs. These animals were then genetically engineered to highly express 9 human transgenes that augmented their blood-coagulation and immunological compatibility with humans. 134 Furthermore, researchers removed three major xenoantigens from these pigs and in turn reduced the likelihood of xenograft rejection secondary to a host immune response. 135 Host production of xenoantibodies is a daunting obstacle for safe and effective clinical xenotransplantation, but this study illustrated the feasibility of successful xenoantigen deletion in pigs.",

We hope to deal with objections related to the moral status of pigs in another publication. \n\nIn the following section we provide background on medical research on xenotransplantation. Subsequently, we draw on empirical evidence concerning the potential harms and benefits of pigs in human xenotransplantation, and claim that great potential benefits justify xenotransplantation, provided that the harm mitigation techniques we discuss are employed. Thereafter, we consider the objection that xenotransplantation is 'unnatural' , and claim that the objection fails due to the indistinctness of the term natural, and because the (un)naturalness of a practice or intervention is an unreliable guide to its morality or goodness. We conclude by discussing some implications for the SA context.",

The production of a rat pancreas by a mouse has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The next step will be the generation of larger chimeric animals, such as pigs bearing human organs. Because of the dramatic organ shortage for transplantation, the medical needs for such a transgressive practice are indisputable. However, there are serious technical barriers and complex ethical issues that must be discussed and solved before producing human organs in animals. The main ethical issues are the risks of consciousness and of human features in the chimeric animal due to a too high contribution of human cells to the brain, in the first case, or for instance to limbs, in the second. Another critical point concerns the production of human gametes by such chimeric animals. These worst-case scenarios are obviously unacceptable and must be strictly monitored by careful risk assessment, and, if necessary, technically prevented. The public must be associated with this ethical debate. Scientists and physicians have a critical role in explaining the medical needs, the advantages and limits of this potential medical procedure, and the ethical boundaries that must not be trespassed. If these prerequisites are met, acceptance of such a new, borderline medical procedure may prevail, as happened before for in-vitro fertilization or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.",

Since the 1990s, researchers have attempted to use pigs as the source animal for xenotransplantation, and the pig is currently considered the most appropriate candidate species. Reasons for selecting the pig as a source animal include the pig's relatively large litter size and short maturation period, its size and physiological similarity to humans, the low risk of xenozoonosis, and the readily application of genetic engineering techniques to produce porcine organs that are resistant to rejection (7). However, the genetic discrepancy between pigs and humans has resulted in barriers for xenotransplantation, including immunological rejection, and risk of xenozoonosis. As with human allotransplants, xenotransplants are prone to immunological rejection. However, a vascularized porcine organ is more vigorously rejected in comparison with the current reaction observed in allotransplants because of the genetic distance between pigs and primates. Thanks to genetically modified pigs and immunosuppressive therapy, survival time results for xenografts have improved considerably in preclinical xenotransplantation models. These results in NHP models indicate that the use of xenotransplantation in clinical applications is approaching.\n\nIn this article, we (a) describe our understanding of immunological rejection responses in xenotransplantation, (b) summarize the genetically modified pigs used for xenotransplantation, and (c) report the current survival time of xenografts in pig-to-NHP models. On the basis of this considerable progress, we hold that clinical application of xenotransplantation will soon be a reality.",

            "text": "Hence, for organ donation and transplantation, as well as for xenotransplantation, we must consider the intention behind actions for, as Jesus himself has stated, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\" (Matthew 5:8, ESV). \n\nXenotransplantation raises further issues for Protestants, including (i) the use of animals for human flourishing, (ii) the risk to neighbors from xenozoonotic infection, and (iii) the acceptability of human finitude. First, animals are used for a variety of purposes to benefit humanity in Christian Scripture, including sacrifice in the Old Testament, food, clothing, and agricultural purposes. Protestants would affirm that the privilege of dominion over the created world is always balanced in Scripture by the responsibility to be a good steward over that which has been entrusted to humanity. Generally, theologically conservative Protestants view the responsible use of animals for human advancement and flourishing as permissible. \n\nSecond, a central ethical issue in xenotransplantation is the risk of xenozoonotic infection to xenograft recipients, close contacts, and public health. The risk may conflict with the Christian duty to steward the body well (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) and love one's neighbor (Matthew 22:39). That is, what does it mean to \"love my neighbor as myself\" if a procedure for my benefit could also cause harm (possible xenozoonosis) to my neighbor? It could be reasonably argued that loving a neighbor would certainly include supporting xenotransplantation research as it provides the opportunity to express compassion for the needs of others and the alleviation of suffering (similar to allotransplantation). Yet, on the other hand, Christians should not be concerned with the welfare of the individual to the detriment of the community (Jeremiah 29:7). While xenotransplantation may lead to greater human flourishing, it could also (albeit, unlikely) prove disastrous for humanity and produce the opposite effect of flourishing. Without significant safety assurances, pursuing xenotransplantation might not align with loving one's neighbor.",

The purpose of this review is to summarize the early experiences of xenotransplantation, with special focus on heart xenotransplantation. It aims to highlight the important ethical concerns of animal-to-human heart xenotransplantation, identify the key immunological barriers to successful long-term xenograft survival, as well as summarize the progress made in terms of development of pharmacological and genetic engineering strategies to address these barriers. Lastly, we discuss more recent attempts of porcine-to-human heart xenotransplantation, as well as provide some commentary on the current concerns and possible applications for future clinical heart xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "This extraordinary progress has led some to speculate that xenotransplantation will ultimately be accomplished through ever increasing genetic modification. This may be part of the answer, but there are three key issues with this approach. First, the xenotransplant community remains divided over exactly which genetic modifications are necessary. While some modifications, including GalTKO, are well-studied, others are supported only by mouse models or by a small number of cases in NHP models. Cost is a major obstacle to definitive research here, as genetically modified animals are expensive to produce, and transplants in NHPs are expensive to conduct. However, these modifications may have unintended consequences (e.g. creation of neoepitopes, seen in transplant of CMAH KO pigs to old world monkeys) (58), and it is important that each individual modification is subject to rigorous scrutiny. \n\nSecond, while genes may be reliably incorporated within the genome using new gene editing technologies, uneven gene expression in transgenic animals remains an issue. Of particular concern is tissue-specific gene expression. For example, transgenes that are only expressed in the liver will not be effective in kidney xenotransplantation. On a more granular level, studies have shown that human CD47 expression in pig endothelial cells and podocytes prevented phagocytosis by correcting CD47-SIRPa species incompatibilities and enabling normal SIRPa signal transduction. Indeed, hCD47 expression on podocytes in hCD47/GalTKO pig-tobaboon kidney transplants was shown to inhibit the development of proteinuria (59).. However, our data also demonstrated that high hCD47 expression in renal tubular cells may lead to destructive inflammatory responses via the hCD47-TSP-1 pathway (59). More research is needed to further refine and reliably predict gene expression in multiply modified pigs. \n\nThird, while genetic modifications may help protect pig xenografts from innate responses, genetic engineering alone is not sufficient to prevent rejection long-term, given the overwhelming number of possible xenoantigens that could trigger adaptive responses and antibody-mediated rejection.",

Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices.

            "text": "It has been more than a century since researchers began investigating the possibility of using animal tissues and organs in humans. Xenotransplantation has risen in popularity as a result of the success of allotransplantation [1], which is 'the transplantation of an organ or tissue from one individual to another of the same species with a different genotype' [2], as a treatment for a variety of illnesses, including organ failure. Xenotransplantation is 'the deliberate transfer of living cells, tissues, or organs from individuals of one species to individuals of another' [3]. It is believed that using pigs as a source of transplants will allow transplantation to have a significantly greater impact on medicine and public health than allotransplantation [4]. However, this has not yet been proven. It is generally agreed that the recipient's immunity, incompatibility of biologic systems, and transfer of new pathogenic organisms are all biologic obstacles to xenotransplantation that are currently impeding its use in clinical settings [4][5][6][7][8][9], in addition to the ethical concerns pertaining to xenotransplantation [4,10]. The genetic modification of animal sources could be a viable answer to the xenotransplantation problem [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. The tools for genetically altering animals have progressed significantly over the past two decades [12]. The advancement of reversal xenografts, in which human stem cells are implanted into pigs under conditions that promote differentiation and enlargement into functioning tissues and maybe organs, has also been aided by the advancement of this novel type of xenograft [3]. It is necessary to evaluate the constraints of genetic engineering and to propose models for advancing xenotransplantation and reverse xenotransplantation clinical applications in order to build on these recent successes.",

            "text": "perception (Lundin and Idvall 2003). Noteworthy in this regard is that options such as human or artificial organs are preferred among patients and other population groups (Haddow 2021a;Rubaltelli et al 2008). This preference has been interpreted as strong affective reactions (Rubaltelli et al 2008(Rubaltelli et al , 2009)). However, qualitative empirical research studies also indicate that xenotransplantation finds acceptance among patients, when no alternative options or treatments exist (Kranenburg et al 2005). Accordingly, health matters tend to take priority over ethical considerations, even regarding the use of animals (K\u00f6gel et al 2021), with the functionality of the transplant important to these patients regardless of the source of the organ (Idvall 2006). The actual risk involved is seen in not receiving a transplant (Lundin and Widner 2000). This is also reflected in paediatric xenotransplantation (Hurst et al 2021) where parents of children with congenital heart disease are willing to consider xenotransplantation as a last resort, but are particularly concerned about the stigmatisation of and among children. Nevertheless, social pressure and religious prohibitions are reported to influence patients' willingness to accept xenotransplants (\u015eahin Akbo\u011fa and Rukiye Hobek 2023). Research with actual xenotransplantation recipients is currently minimal but shows that survival (Lundin 1999(Lundin , 2001(Lundin , 2002) ) and, among adolescents, autonomy (Ter\u00e1n-Escand\u00f3n et al 2005) take priority over other concerns. In this regard, various justifications for using animals are constructed (Lundin 1999(Lundin , 2001)), leading to entanglements of identity issues and normalisation (Lundin 2002). All these patient groups vary in their diagnosis and do not offer a uniform perspective, hence our calling for future social science research.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation has shown considerable promise in earlystage studies, bridging a critical gap between theoretical potential and practical clinical application (31). This transition from laboratory success to real-world efficacy underscores the importance of preclinical research as an essential step. This phase serves not only to validate findings from controlled laboratory settings in more clinically relevant scenarios but also to identify unforeseen challenges that may not be apparent in initial studies. The intricate dance between clinical application and laboratory research is informed by these challenges, directing the trajectory of future investigations. The exploration of genetically engineered pigs, particularly those modified with multiple genes, marks a significant advancement in this field (3). However, delving deeper into the specific functions of these genetic modifications and the discovery of new xenoantigens remain critical areas for further research. The protracted process of breeding these genetically altered pigs also poses a logistical challenge, emphasizing the need for streamlining breeding techniques to enhance research efficiency. \n\nThe ethical considerations surrounding the selection of participants for clinical trials, especially the inclusion of end-stage renal disease patients or those not eligible for conventional transplants, continue to provoke debate. Alternatively, the use of brain-dead individuals in preclinical studies presents a less contentious pathway, aligning with both ethical standards and research needs. Meanwhile, the quest for optimal immunosuppression strategies remains ongoing, with the current regimens requiring refinement to improve outcomes and reduce adverse effects. The consistency in selecting donor genotypes and standardizing perioperative care protocols also presents a significant hurdle, mirroring the complexity of translating xenotransplantation into a clinically viable option. Persistent issues such as graft rejection, inflammation, coagulation disorders, maintaining the physiological function of transplanted kidneys, and managing the risk of viral transmission underscore the multifaceted challenges ahead. \n\nAs preclinical research progresses, it is imperative to tackle these obstacles head-on, paving the way for the successful integration of xenotransplantation into clinical practice. The future of this innovative field hinges on our ability to navigate these complexities, requiring a concerted effort from researchers, clinicians, and ethicists alike.",

To address transplant needs and shortages of human organs, NIAID established The Immunobiology of Xenotransplantation Cooperative Research Program (IXCRP). Xenotransplantation is a transplant from one species to another. The goal of this program is to develop preclinical pig to NHP models of islet, kidney, heart, lung, or liver transplantation. Genetically modified (GM) pigs offer unique benefits as xenograft donors because they are anatomically and physiologically similar to humans. These GM pigs are developed through an iterative process of gene editing to ensure each gene modification dampens the recipient immune response to the transplanted organ, thus increasing xenograft survival.\n\nResearch supported by the IXCRP laid the foundation for the first pig-to-human heart transplant that took place in 2022. Following the surgery, the 57-year-old male recipient had excellent cardiac function. This initial success has encouraged expansion of both preclinical and clinical research activities. NIAID has supported xenotransplantation research since 2003 and will continue to ensure high scientific, regulatory, and ethical standards in this rapidly evolving field.",

New gene editing technologies now potentially offer a new and feasible way to genetically modify research animals in order to reduce or eliminate their ability to feel pain and to suffer. In this paper, we discuss the ethical concerns this new technology and new possibility raise and evaluate the implications of such genetic modifications with regards to the legal regulations in animal research in Europe. Abstract Every year, around 12 million animals are used for the purpose of scientific research in the European Union alone. The procedures performed on them often cause significant pain and suffering. Despite regulations aimed at reducing this suffering, we can expect millions of research animals to continue to suffer in the near to mid-term future. Given this reality, we propose the use of gene editing to create research animals with a reduced capacity for suffering, in particular, from pain. We argue that our proposal would be in line with moral principles embedded in European regulations regarding animal research, and that it would facilitate compliance with these regulations. We also respond to the strongest argument against our proposal\u2014the \u2018no pain no gain\u2019 argument.",

Recent advancements in interspecies chimerism enabled by CRISPR/Cas9 (Wu et al., 2017), and xenografts, including successful long-term survival of pig organ grafts in non-human primates (Mohiuddin et al., 2016;L\u00e4ngin et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2019;Ma et al., 2022;Mohiuddin et al., 2022), have sparked renewed enthusiasm for this approach. The pioneering pig-to-human heart transplant in 2022 (Griffith et al., 2022), alongside encouraging data from experiments using pig kidneys (Montgomery et al., 2022), underscores the potential of xenotransplantation to address organ shortages. Crucial to these advancements are genetic modifications enabled by gene-editing techniques, mainly CRISPR-Cas9, which allow for the modification of animal organs more akin to human physiology, reducing rejection risks (Ryczek et al., 2021). Utilizing edited animals offers a dependable supply of quality-controlled organs, optimizing size, structure, and function while mitigating infectious risks. Xenotransplantation could broaden access to transplantation, particularly for those at early stages of organ failure, improving outcomes and quality of life (Sykes and Sachs, 2022). The pig, due to its size, availability, breeding characteristics, and physiological likeness to humans, has emerged as the preferred source animal for xenografts (Xi et al., 2023).",

The use of organs from these animals would theoretically reduce the important mortality on transplant lists worldwide due to the lack of donors. ][3][4][5] Swine is a species with great potential to be an organ donor because they have organs morphologically and physiologically compatible with those of humans; nevertheless, this method may cause hyperacute rejection, an immunological reaction caused by pre-formed antibodies that destroy the transplanted organs in a few hours and are always present in transplantation between species very different (discordant xenotransplantation). [1][2][3] This catastrophic immunological reaction was responsible for the failures of the first xenotransplants performed using organs and tissues from non-genetically modified animals in the 60s and 70s and caused the abandonment of this methodology. 2,4 ][7] The evolution of genetic modulation of living beings using technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) provide the creation of genetically modified pigs whose organs would be immunologically compatible with human, escaping from hyperacute rejection. 8 Research using an organ from these modified animals transplanted in non-human primates accomplished promising results, especially in terms of survival and function. 9 hese progresses revived the interest in clinical xenotransplantation and brought great hope to thousands of patients on the transplant list and inspired optimistic expectations in several researchers.

[99]. Xenotransplantation offers new hope for people on organ transplantation waiting lists. \n\nThe earliest record of xenotransplantation was a cornea transplantation trial that took place in 1838 [100]. Another xenotransplantation of a rabbit kidney to a human was done in 1905, and the patient died after 17 days due to graft rejection [101]. Between 1920-1990 many transplant studies were done using the kidneys, hearts, and livers of non-human primates [102], as well as other mammals, including rabbits, sheep, and pigs [103]. \n\nThe modern concept of xenotransplantation focuses mainly on pigs as donors, pigs share physiological similarities with humans, reach sexual maturity within few months, and produce large litters. Moreover, they carry a lower risk of zoonotic disease transmission compared to nonhuman primates (NHPs) and can be bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, which further minimizes infection risks [104]. Additionally, the use of primate organs is unsustainable due to ethical concerns and the endangered status of many primate species [105]. \n\nThe Third WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials recommended that donor pigs should possess a minimum set of 'essential' genetic modifications [106]; those recommendations are based on three main principles:",

Clinical trials and preclinical studies have suggested that living cells and tissue from other species have the potential to be used in humans to ameliorate disease. However, the potential for successful xenotransplantation to cure human disease is coupled with the risk that therapeutic use of living nonhuman cells in humans may also serve to introduce xenogeneic infections of unpredictable significance. Animal husbandry practices and xenotransplantation product preparation may eliminate most exogenous infectious agents prior to transplantation. However, endogenous retroviruses are present in the genomes of all mammalian cells, have an inadequately defined ability to infect human cells, and have generated public health concern. The history of xenotransplantation, the implications for public health, the global consensus on public safeguards necessary to accompany clinical trials, and the future direction of xenotransplantation are discussed in the context of public health.

            "text": "In November 2012, the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC) published its opinion on the welfare implications of breeding and breeding technologies in commercial livestock agriculture (FAWC, 2012). Though the FAWC noted that the regulation of genetic material has not kept up with advances in biotechnology, it failed to address the broader question of whether the regulation of the entire, fast-developing field of veterinary assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) is adequately protecting animal welfare. This paper attempts to answer that subject by assessing first what the current regulation of ARTs aims to do to protect animal welfare and whether those aims are fulfilled, and secondly whether, even if the aims of current regulation are being fulfilled, they are adequate to protect animal welfare in the twenty first century. \n\nAssisted reproduction is the most tightly regulated area of human medicine, being governed by primary legislation in the form of the Human Embryology Act (1990, as amended) and by a statutory body (the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority). The underlying reason for the extraordinary level of regulation of assisted reproduction in human medicine is concern that the techniques which are being used potentially affect not only the individuals demanding treatment but also other potential and existing individuals, and society as a whole. Veterinary assisted reproduction is regulated much less tightly than human assisted reproduction, but at a level which is more consistent both with all other human medical specialities and with all areas of veterinary medicine. The purpose of this paper is not to argue that assisted veterinary reproduction deserves special regulatory consideration. Creation of human:animal admixed embryos does require special regulatory consideration, because of the impact which it has on society and on very essential moral questions such as what qualifies a being to be considered human. However, that it already provided for in the HFE Act (2008, as amended). Rather, I hope to show that current regulation of ARTs fails to protect animal welfare adequately, and that the reasons for that failure are not particular to assisted reproduction butare rather associated with a more general lack of safeguards relating to , training, specialisation and the legal framework of veterinary regulation, which apply also to and ought also to be considered in relation to other veterinary specialities. \n\nThere are three main areas of concern about animal welfare and the regulation of veterinary assisted reproductive technologies. The first is the technologies themselves.",

            "text": "For example, in a 1999 article in Science, George Gaskell and his associates showed that a higher percentage of the European public opposed xenotransplantation than any other biotechnological modality. Prima facie, this appears to be incomprehensible. After all, xenotransplantation is most directly relevant to saving lives. Gaskell has also repeatedly made the point that moral concerns are more important to the public in evaluating biotechnology than considerations of risk and safety [25]. Obviously, xenotransplantation is seen as presenting weighty moral concerns. \n\nMany people articulated what we have called \"spurious moral concerns\" (bad ethics), i.e., reasons for rejecting transplanting organs from animals, including concerns about the \"unnatural\" dimension of such a procedure. Others saw xenotransplantation as \"playing God\" or \"crossing species barriers\". Such claims are easily defeated. If transplanting organs from animals to humans is unnatural, so too are building flying machines, damming the Nile, exterminating pathogenic insects, and the myriad activities in which we engage to make nature more congenial to human life and flourishing. In the same manner, we can put paid to claims that \"crossing species barriers violates God's will\". One can plausibly claim that if God did not wish humans to blur the lines between species, as we have in fact done repeatedly in plant agriculture, why would He have given us the ability to do so? (In fact, many theologians who support biotechnology make precisely this claim.) The key point is that theologically-based opinions do not in and of themselves constitute rational ethical concerns. \n\nI personally believe that much of the opposition to xenotransplantation stems from the appalling degree of social illiteracy regarding transplant science. Many people in society, for example, still retain the ancient belief that the heart is where personality resides and is the locus and seat of emotions, thought, and will, a belief entertained by both the ancient Greeks and the ancient Egyptians. This idea of course persists in the belief that love is founded in the heart, and in such phrases as \"he has a kind heart\". (Hence the myth of Cupid firing arrows into the heart.)",

Though the Working Partying acknowledged that xenotransplantation was highly contested, it concluded that 'there are no significant in-principle ethical objections to the use of live organs and tissues from animals for human therapies, that would preclude any further research to develop such therapies' (emphasis in the original) (XWP 2003a, para 12.8). It reiterated a position it adopted in the previous consultation. That is, xenotransplantation clinical trials should be allowed to proceed 'if there are clear potential benefits, both for individual patients and for the general public' (XWP 2003a, para 12.15). The draft guidelines were revised to incorporate two new topics: animal welfare and patient selection. The additional guidelines required research protocols to specify clear information on the criteria for patient selection (proposed Guideline 4) (XWP 2003a, 158). Further, in accordance with the relevant regulations, all pre-clinical and clinical xenotransplantation studies are required to meet rigorous animal welfare standards (proposed Guideline 1) (XWP 2003a, 158).\n\nSimilarly to the initial consultation, the second round of consultation involved public meetings and a call for written submissions. In February 2004, the XWP held public meetings in all capital cities around the country attracting a total of 377 attendees. On this occasion, there were no targeted meetings. After the second round of meetings, Jack Sparrow, the second Chairperson of the XWP, made general comments on public responses in an interview on national radio. Sparrow reported that transplant recipients and patients on waiting lists, and their families supported xenotransplantation (Beaumont and Noble 2004, 3). However, he also added that ' Australians are more fearful about the use of living animal material in humans than they were 18 months ago as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and bird flu outbreaks overseas' (Reuters News 2004). The Working Party received a total of 343 written submissions from respondents in Australia and overseas (XWP 2004, 4). From its public consultation, the XWP found that 'animal-to-human transplantation, in particular animal organ transplantation, is not",

            "text": "Animal welfare and ethics (AWE) is an integral and growing component of modern veterinary education [1]. The reasons for this include an increasing community concern about animal welfare [2,3] and growing public expectation that veterinarians demonstrate competency and knowledge in AWE principles underpinning the societal use of animals [4], including the use of animals for scientific purposes. Given veterinarians attain the skills and knowledge required to provide animal care and disease management for a wide range of species, they are ideally placed to: (i) understand the potential impacts of many scientific procedures on animals; and (ii) ensure the welfare of the animals affected. Veterinarians can provide a valued and unique perspective on numerous areas of animal use, including the challenging issues that arise when animals are used for scientific purposes.\n\nAlthough the use of animals for scientific purposes still attracts debate, as described below, the current regulatory position in most western countries allows regulated animal use to occur because of the perceived benefits in generating new knowledge and in the development of therapies for humans and animals alike [5]. Animals kept for scientific purposes include those used for the education of animal science, biomedical, and veterinary students in a variety of contexts. In Australia, and around the world, animals used for research or teaching are not limited to laboratory rodents; many species are used, including livestock, birds, cats, dogs, poultry, reptiles, fish, and wildlife [6].\n\nThe use of animals for scientific purposes engenders a wide range of ethical perspectives, with some people seeking the complete abolition of animal use, and others strongly supporting their continued use (reviewed by Ormandy and Schuppli) [7]. Although regulatory systems vary from country to country, in most jurisdictions, research and teaching institutions are required to ensure that staff and students using animals for scientific purposes are appropriately trained, that animals are well cared for, and that the ethical review process for projects is robust. Hence, this is a growing area of involvement for veterinarians, including their roles as: educators (to public, clients, new researchers, and industry); researchers or teaching academics; members of institutional animal ethics committees or their equivalents; technical consultants for research teams or animal facility managers; health and welfare consultants in regional and international areas; government veterinarians; welfare organization veterinarians; and regulators.\n\nIncreasingly",

            "text": "Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound. Indeed, in this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done, in which our given human nature no longer commands respect, in which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our autonomous rational wills, repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder (Kass 1997, 20).\n\nWhen given a choice responses in the current research suggest a majority view against xenotransplantation and hugely favourable response in favour of 3-D bioprinted ones followed by organs from a known individual and then a deceased stranger. The popularity of 3-D bioprinting and the desire to have personalised organs relate to avoiding concerns about bodily functioning that xenotransplantation raises (reliability and compatibility), avoidable harm to others (including non-human animals) and knowledge about the source of the organ. Although pigs that would be used for xenotransplantation would be clinically and medically grade pathogen-free, responses in the current research suggest the pig is thought to be dirty, physiologically incompatible, and potentially a vehicle of disease. As I have shown, there is little variation in terms of religion or vegetarianism beliefs that helps explain respondents' negative views of xenotransplantation. Views about xenotransplantation might be therefore closer to understandings about chimaeras and the mixed bodies of species, rather than vegetarianism. The creation of chimaeras and hybrids, for example, is seen as 'an affront to the hierarchical superiority and separateness of the human species' despite the practice of breeding animals and hybridised plants ( Knoppers and Joly 2007, 284).\n\nIndeed, as shown in the focus groups and survey, were the imagined possibilities of becoming 'part pig'. Xenotransplantation, as is the case with beliefs about possible gender alteration through human organ donation, potentially threatens an individual's subjectivity. Previous studies show that proposals to mix non-human animal and human organs produces public reactions of disgust or 'yuck'",

The components of vaccine for disease control and nutraceuticals for human health by altering the food components or by introducing the health provide proteins, peptides and other components may be the integral part of human life in coming days. Genetically engineered animals also offer significant human health and environmental benefits, livestock becomes more efficient for converting feed to animal protein and reducing waste production. Finally, genetic engineering will improve the welfare of animals by imparting resistance to disease and enhancing overall health and well being. Objective: This study reviews the basics of genetic engineering and their scope in various fields of life. Conclusion: The need is to commercialize the technology by the authentication on science based formulations. The judicial approaches and validation of the technologies by removing the myths related to the technology are some other issues must be handled properly.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is 'the practice of transplanting, implanting or infusing cells, tissues or organs from one species to another' (Ravelingien et al. 2002, 92). It may involve internal or external xenogenic therapies 1 designed as a temporary bridging device or as a 'final solution to end-stage organ failure' (Boneva and Folks 2004, 504). For the purpose of addressing organ scarcity, scientists have generally experimented with organs and tissues from different breeds of pigs. However, towards the end of the 1990s, virologists began to query the safety of xenotransplantation due to the possibility of infectious diseases caused by porcine endogenous retroviruses. A number of scientists called for a moratorium until the controversy could be resolved through open debate and public policy.\n\nWhile some countries adopted a ban, others pursued a permissive stance on clinical xenotransplantation. A de facto moratorium was adopted in Canada following a novel experiment in public consultation. In Australia, the xenotransplantation controversy was sparked by a clinical trial involving the use of porcine cells to treat diabetes. Following a national inquiry, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) imposed a 5 year moratorium on clinical trials involving animal-to-human transplantation.\n\nSobbrio and Jorqui observed that public engagement on xenotransplantation in Canada and Australia represented significant developments in 'experimental democracy' (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014, 523). They wrote, democratic social contract between institutions and citizens; they aimed at engaging citizens in more direct decision-making; they explored and inquired into relevant issues about technological innovation and social change; and they attempted to introduce a new concept of scientific citizenship through the identity of the citizen scientist (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014: 528).\n\nA number of publications have analysed the Canadian and/or Australian xenotransplantation controversies. Such work generally adopt either a national or comparative perspective (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014;McLean and Williamson 2005;Cook 2011Cook , 2014Beynon-Jones and Brown 2011;Einsiedel et al. 2011a;Tallachini 2011;Allspaw 2004;",

            "text": "However, researchers and the public still have concerns about the risk of human cells integrating into the host animal's brain or germline, and these concerns need to be taken into account. Unlike transgene technology, which introduces an exogenous gene into the host genome randomly, genome editing only changes the endogenous gene in an efficient and accurate way. With these new technologies, the FDA is maintaining a product-focused, science-based regulatory policy with specific legal standards applied to different REVIEW types of products. The FDA has determined that animals with intentionally altered genomes should be subjected to regulations under the provisions of new animal drugs [154]. Unlike the FDA, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has stated that the USDA will not regulate genetically modified plants produced by the new genome editing techniques [155], which will definitely accelerate the commercialization of genome-edited organisms. With further studies to solve the 'off-target' effects and potential risks to the host genome, genome editing of animals may become more accepted by the public. In summary, the rapid progress of genome editing in large animals has resulted in the production of many valuable animals for human disease models, xenotransplantation and the agricultural economy (Table 1). Further optimization of the existing genome editing system and the generation of new tools for precise gene modification will additionally accelerate the development of genetically modified animals, organs and tissues for agriculture, regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications.",

Therefore, alternatives to the use of human organs for transplantation, continue to be explored including use of stem cells, artificial organs, and organs from other species (xenotransplantation). In xenotransplantation, the species of choice remains the pig due to its physiological similarities to humans, reduced costs, ease of manipulation, and reduced ethical concerns to its use. However, in order to develop pig organs that are suitable for xenotransplantation, complex genetic modification need to be undertaken. These modifications require the introduction of precise genetic changes into the pig that can only be accomplished at this time using somatic cell nuclear transfer. We cover in this review advances in transgenic manipulation and cloning in swine and how the development of these two technologies is critical to the eventual utilization of the pig as a human organ donor.",

            "text": "Signed in to law in 1966, the Animal Welfare Act was originally intended to prevent the theft and subsequent sale of privately owned animals to research facilities and was later expanded to \"regulated groups and individuals\" that \"exhibit, transport, or use animals in the pursuit of medical and scientific knowledge\" (https://awahistory. nal.usda.gov/timeline). The Animal Welfare Act is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and outlines minimum acceptable standards for the treatment of animals bred for use in research (https://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/animal-welfareact). In 1985, the act was amended to require the formation of institutional animal care and use committees (IACUC) to review studies that proposed to use animals for research and provided guidance on the reduction of pain and distress in laboratory animals. \n\nOne of the foundational premises of the Animal Welfare Act is that laboratory animals do not have an inherent advocate and thus federal regulations must guide their ethical use in research. This is, of course, not the case with client-owned animals in the context of veterinary clinical studies; however, federal funding sources still mandate IACUC review for studies involving clientowned animals [4]. Unique to veterinary clinical studies, animals are presented by their owner/care-givers, who are seeking research involvement in the context of veterinary health care and bring an additional set of ethical considerations that extend beyond treatment of the animal itself. These include the existence of the human/animal bond and its influence on willingness to enroll a pet in a clinical study; the veterinary client-patient relationship and the potential for lines between clinical caregiver and researcher to be blurred; differing endpoints and early study removal criteria than may be allowable or relevant for research using purpose-bred animals; and the concept of informed consent for owners and how that may differ when the study subject is an individual animal versus a group or herd of animals. \n\nIt is clear that groups reviewing veterinary clinical studies must consider some aspects of the regulatory framework surrounding the use of animals in research, but they also must examine ethical questions similar to those articulated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as vital during human trial review and approval as well as have a clear understanding of the practice of and regulations associated with veterinary medicine.",

            "text": "The environmental impact is difficult to predict and will depend on the number of escaped fish, their phenotypic characteristics (related to ability for reproduction and survival over time), and the aquatic biodiversity present in the receiving ecosystem (Kapuscinski & Brister, 2001). \n\nAnother potential problem related to transgenic fish that is disease or parasite resistant may be similar to what has been experienced with insect resistant crops (Le Curie-Belford et al., 2009). It has for example been reported that insects have developed resistance to insect resistant crops. Hence, the benefit achieved may over time develop into a long-term problem. If the same unexpected events develops with disease or parasite resistant fish the consequence will be a need for more or other antibiotics and chemicals to cope with resistant pathogens and parasites or new emerging pathogens. \n\nDevelopment of transgenic fish does also raise ethical concern. One implication by the genetic modification process itself is that it may affect fish welfare, behaviour and reproduction (see also Le Curie-Belford et al., 2009). It has been reported pleiotropic effects as changes in coloration, cranial, opercula and lower jaw deformation in transgenic coho salmon (Devlin et al., 1995). Concerns have also been raised that genetic modification strategies may affect the animal's integrity (Verhoog, 2001). This is controversial, and for example Sand\u00f8e & Holtug (1998) argue that only welfare of animals and humans are relevant ethical considerations, and that these considerations imply to: \n\n1. Clarify realistic alternatives for improving animals welfare through breeding or biotechnology 2. Consider positive and negative effects on animal welfare 3. Find what benefits are at stake for humans 4. If animals welfare is reduced, consider if the costs of animals will weigh up for humans benefits 5. Weigh conflicting concerns, including risk of possible long term side effects. \n\nWhen weighing conflicting ethical concerns we often have to compromise between efficiency and animal welfare, where different ethical theories of animal ethics may affect acceptance of biotechnology on animals (Sand\u00f8e & Christensen, 2008):",

However, there are a number of ethical, legal, and social issues to consider, and it is necessary to know the public attitudes regarding them.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA Computer Aided Web Interview consisting of 22 questionnaire items was conducted to investigate the attitudes of Korean related to xenotransplantation. Participants were selected from Hankook Research MS (Master Sample) panel. A total of 1007 sets of data were finally collected and analyzed with SPSS. A statistical analysis was performed using an independent t-test and chi-square method.\n\n\nRESULTS\n72.9% of the respondents were positive about xenotransplantation, while 22.2% negative. 61.7% said that they would accept xenotransplantation for incurable diseases. 64.4% agreed with genetically modified pigs for organ resource. 61% agreed that the brain dead could be transplanted first for research purpose, while 32.7% disagreed. The ratio of response that the risk of zoonotic infection is important was 97.2%; the safety issue due to immunosuppression 98.7%; the human identity issue after transplantation 67.4%; and the animal right issue 51.6%. Men were more favorable to xenotransplantation than women on all but one item (stigmatization). There was no significant difference between religions except for the human identity issue.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nKorean people are favorable to xenotransplantation as a therapeutic option and also positive with the use of pig even genetically modified in spite of the issue of animal rights. They are also positive with the idea of using the brain dead as study subject for xenotransplantation, which is currently forbidden in Korea.",

The case of Mr. David Bennett Sr. received worldwide acclaim when a \"xenoheart\" 28 , or a human heart sourced from a genetically modified pig, was transplanted into a profoundly ill patient. Mr. Bennett experienced \"8 weeks of post-operative success\" with his new xenoheart that, according to a care provider involved in the case, \"continued to function until his death\" 28 . \n\nMr. Bennett's case is complex, touching on a wide range of potential ethical issues. While Mr. Bennett's life was extended by 2 months through the use of a xenoheart (also referred to as a \"porcine\" or \"pig\" heart in the popular press), several notable characteristics of Bennett as a patient highlight how medically risky it is to replace traditional forms of solid organ transplantation and life-sustaining treatment. For example, during the time that Bennett was kept alive through the use of a xenoheart, he was described as bedridden and on life support. Some of the promotional material coming out of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's animal-tohuman transplant program, where Bennett was receiving care, certainly suggested a less-than-pleasant quality of life 29 . Additionally, Bennett, 57 at the time of the operation and suffering from life-threatening arrhythmia, was categorized as historically \"medically noncompliant.\" In simpler terms, Bennett was not eligible for placement on the national organ waiting list due to a history of \"failing to follow doctors' orders\" 30 . The doctor that performed the transplant described Bennett as \"someone with no alternatives\" and \"who very likely wouldn't be able to leave the hospital without a transplant\"-an ideal candidate to receive a \"genetically modified pig heart transplant\" 31 . \n\nIn these initial, groundbreaking cases, recipients of xenohearts, porcine, or other non-human organ transplants are likely to be similarly situated: incredibly vulnerable patients deserving of increased bioethical scrutiny.",

            "text": "Due to the shortage of human organs for allotransplantation, essential efforts aimed at developing a transgenic source animal (donor) for animal-human xenotransplantation have been performed over the last decade. Although man is concordant with old world primates, and the choice of this species would be an obvious way to prevent hyperacute rejection, there are several good reasons for preferring pigs to primates (Table 1). Therefore, concerns for future maintenance problems should be related to the pig. It can be questioned whether maintenance conditions of the transgenic xenograft donor pigs will differ significantly from non-transgenic pigs. Due to the fact that a xenograft donor pig is not yet fully available, little factual knowledge about this issue is available. However, in relation to a future xenograft donor pig basic and applied research has already created knowledge usable for the prediction of its health and welfare. Transgenic knock out mice partly equivalent to a future donor pig have existed for years, and basic knowledge on the function of the strategic transgenes is also available. Therefore, essential information on the impact of these modifications may be achieved by combining this information. Basically, these will be reared and cared for as for other pigs, but two considerations may make the maintenance principles different. Firstly, transgenesis may have induced new health and welfare problems in these pigs, and secondly, the specialized use of the pig may induce new hazards to the xenograft recipients and even to mankind, as such.",

Due to pressures from the international scientific community, Mexican xenotransplantation was eventually terminated by local government authorities. By contrast to Valdes' practice, a xenotransplantation clinical trial outsourced by a New Zealand company to a research institute in Moscow was not contested by the scientific community. These trials voluntarily adhered to the guidelines issued by the FDA which included provisions for the surveillance and risk management of infectious agents (Cook et al. 2011).\n\nFollowing the controversy over xenotourism in Mexico, the World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted a Resolution on Human Organ and Tissue Transplantation in May 2004. WHA Resolution 57.18 was passed by 192 countries. It urges Member states 'to allow xenogeneic transplantation only when effective national regulatory control and surveillance mechanisms overseen by national health authorities are in place' (Fifty-Seventh WHA 2004: Clause II). Xenotransplantation clinical trials should only be permissible in countries with a welldeveloped regulatory framework to oversee high-risk biomedical research. In the absence of stringent regulations, clinical xenotransplantation would pose a global public health risks. In addition, WHA Resolution 57.18 also advises Member States to engage in the harmonisation of regulatory practice and to 'support international collaboration and coordination for the prevention and surveillance of infections resulting from xenogeneic transplantation' (Fifty-Seventh WHA 2004: Clause II).\n\nConsistent with the global approach, permissive law on xenotransplantation was enacted in Switzerland in 1999 (Griessler 2012). Xenotransplantation is permitted subject to prior authorisation and due compliance with regulatory requirements. Swiss interests in xenotransplantation is linked to commercial investments in research made by Norvatis (formerly Sandoz). On the other hand, xenotransplantation research was also contested by political parties and NGOs including the Green Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Basel Appeal Against Genetic Engineering, Greenpeace Switzerland, Physicians against Animal Experimentation and the Swiss Animal Protection.

[3] Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of same species), syngeneic transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and auto transplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person). \n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immune compromised mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research. Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. [4] A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to animal testing, animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds. [5] A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published. [6] It is common for patients and physicians to use the term \"allograft\" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-tohuman) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction in usage.",

There is general consensus that the porcine species is the species of choice, based on a number of factors including that in many organ systems, the physiology of pigs and humans is remarkably similar. Pigs can be bred and maintained in large numbers within enclosed, biosecure facilities, with large litter sizes being in order of ten piglets or more, time to sexual maturity being short (about 6-8 months), and gestation time being less than 4 months. Genetic engineering techniques have been developed and are being used to modify pigs via transgenesis, gene modification, and gene knock-out (KO) technologies 2,3 to reduce immunogenicity and potentially improve safety. 5][6] As a result of these factors, a porcine-derived replacement pancreatic islet cell xenotransplantation product has now been used in patients with diabetes under national regulatory oversight [7][8][9] demonstrating both safety and efficacy. 10 ere are stringent guidelines issued by regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the generation and production of pigs for Xenotransplantation. 11 Originally, the term specific (or specified) pathogen free (SPF) as it relates to swine production was not specifically created to help researchers but for pork producers to economically raise healthier animals under the premise that if the disease load can be lightened, better health and growth performance can be achieved. 12",

Currently, fiction is realized as robots, cyborgs, and chimeras. Technology (a technique provided by science) is precisely allowing the expansion of the integration of Homo sapiens to Nature. There have been centuries of this integration into the plant world, pharmaceuticals, for example. Integration with the animal is essentially food, but also transport (horses), safety (guard dog, visually impaired dog), and Health (leeches are still used in reconstructive surgeries to prevent thrombosis). \n\nSince the use of porcine tissue bioprostheses, which was abandoned especially for infectious aspects, transhumanism is related to the treatment of several diseases. The cyborg is there, those who have a coronary stent, implantable defibrillator, or other therapeutic equipment are people analogous to cyborgs. In fact, the defibrillator is independent of the person and acts by itself. The potential of xenotransplantation is an evolutionary variation of transplantation between humans because it not only expands the potential of donor availability, but also does not depend on the donor's will, but on various laws, including those related to the protection of animals. \n\nThe pig, unlike the non-human great primates, seems to be the element of nature that best fits the human being to serve as a donor.",

            "text": "Organ failure is a major public health and economic burden that increases mortality and reduces quality of life. Organ transplantation has become the standard of care for many patients with organ failure, but for the more than 100 thousand patients waitlisted for organ transplants in the U.S. and the millions of people with organ failure who are not on a waitlist, demand greatly exceeds supply. [1,2] pproaches to mitigate the organ shortage include increasing organ donations (both deceased and living), improving organ preservation methods and increasing the recovery of organs after cardiorespiratory declaration of death, improving organ transport, increasing acceptance of expanded criteria organs, and improving post-transplant outcomes to reduce the need for re-transplant. Current levels of investment and attention to these approaches have not sufficiently increased supply. Cross-species transplantation-xenotransplantation-of solid organs has been studied for decades with no definitively successful outcomes in human recipients due to formidable immunologic barriers. [3] Recent advancements in genetic engineering and immunosuppression have led to increased investment in nonhuman animals as a possible source of organs. [6] The first heart xenotransplant took place in March 2022. The patient died 60 days after transplant. [4] n September 2023, a second xeno-heart transplant was performed in a living patient who survived just over five weeks. [7] n March 2024, the first genetically engineered pig kidney transplant was performed in a living person, but despite surgeons' belief that the organ \"would last for at least two years,\" the patient died in May. [8,9] In April 2024, a second xeno-kidney transplant of this kind was performed, but heart-related complications led surgeons to remove it 47 days later, and in July, the patient died. [10,11]  flurry of press and medical commentaries primarily cast a favorable light on the technique, touting its promise to solve the organ shortage while failing to adequately question whether it can be done safely or ethically. [12,13] ignificant immunological and technical limitations, ethical and moral implications, and clinical, public health, and environmental risks restrict xenotransplantation as a viable, mainstream treatment for organ failure.",

            "text": "These six themes were found in seven different research fields (Table 2). The largest body of literature focusses on ethical considerations around early-phase trials in the field of cellbased therapy; 55 articles are published in this field, and the authoritative ISSCR guidelines are widely used (12,(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26). There is less literature on ethical aspects of early-phase clinical trials in the field of 3D bioprinting, and organoid transplantation; seven articles were published on 3D bioprinting, three articles on bioartificial organs, and two on organoid transplantation. Six empirical studies using questionnaires and interviews to investigate patients' and professionals' views on ethical considerations in early-phase clinical trials, were included. Seven papers were published in surgical journals. \n\nTheme 1: Cell Sources 53 out of 92 articles mention ethical considerations related to the sources of cells used to generate complex tissue-engineered products such as bio-artificial or 3D bio-printed organs for transplantation into humans (9, 12, 16-24, 26-68). There are four types of cell sources: 1) xenogeneic cells, 2) autologous, 3) allogeneic donor, and 4) highly manipulated or/and genetically modified cells in humans, each with their own sets of ethical considerations (Table 3). \n\nFirstly, xenogeneic cells are associated with a risk of zoonosis (17,20,38,(47)(48)(49). For instance, issues related to the transmission of the infectious porcine retrovirus (PERV) from pig to human (69). Potential future patients could also reject the use of these cells to generate bio-artificial organs on religious grounds or for socio-cultural reasons (e.g., to protect animal rights/welfare) (33,38,48,50,52), even if their religious leaders take a more moderate stance (33). According to the literature, using these cells for transplantation into humans should be minimized as much as possible (12,17,38).",

The first Xenotransplantation Advisory Consultation was held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2005 [13]. \n\nIt was followed by the First WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials, which was organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Health of China, the International Xenotransplantation Association and the University of Central-South China in Changsha, China, in 2008. The recommendations were published as the \"Changsha Communiqu\u00e9\" [14] to develop and to update regulatory requirements for xenotransplantation clinical trials. \n\nThe Second WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials was organized in collaboration with the TTS and the IXA in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2011, and had a focus on xenotransplantation-associated infectious risk [15,16]. \n\nThe Third WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials was organized in collaboration with the IXA and the EMA in Changsha, China, December 2018 [17].",

Genetic engineering raises concerns about unforeseen ecological consequences and the risks associated with gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9. When evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of recombinant fibrous proteins, animal models are necessarily needed. However, the use of animal models necessitates careful attention to animal welfare and the exploration of alternative testing methods. Additionally, rigorous safety testing is essential to address potential health risks to humans, while environmental assessments are crucial to prevent accidental release and ecological disruption. The commercialization of these therapies also presents ethical challenges, including ensuring equitable access to treatments and addressing the implications of intellectual property rights on innovation and accessibility. Engaging stakeholders, including patients, policymakers, and the public, in ethical discussions is essential. Establishing clear ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, and promoting responsible stewardship of biological resources are crucial for navigating these complex ethical considerations.",

            "text": "From an ethical and societal perspective, swine species is considered as the most potential as the donor species animal source of cells, tissues and organ for safety, effectiveness, ethical, and economic reasons 12,13 . Their favorable breeding characteristics (large litters and rapid maturation) and feasibility for genetic manipulation to insert or delete genes also help the development of clinical xenotransplantation. The porcine organs and biological systems as well as their functions are very close to those in humans in term of anatomical and physiological similarities. Porcine proteins and tissues have already been applied in clinics, such as prosthetic porcine heart valves, heparin for anti-coagulation, factor VIII to treat hemophilia, and porcine insulin to treat type 1 diabetes [14][15][16][17] . Xenogeneic cell therapy using porcine cells as a donor source has several distinct advantages: First, from a well characterized and identified animal source, xenogeneic cells with specialized characteristics and functions could be isolated and ex vivo expanded from different specific tissues without the need to directed differentiation that is required by allogeneic human stem cells. And second, xenogeneic cells from porcine donors could be well manufactured by raising animals under strict quality controlled conditions and streamlining cell production process to provide safe tissues and consistent, safe cell preparations. The risk of pathogen transmission could be mitigated through raising animals under designated pathogen-free (DPF) conditions and producing cells with good manufacturing practices (GMP) system 18,19 . Furthermore, precise and effective genetic engineering to genetically modify animals or porcine cells could be achieved by the development of mRNA-based expression and CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing methodologies 20,21 .",

            "text": "The spectacular advances in the field of allogeneic organ transplantation achieved in the course of the last 30 years have made it possible to improve not only the life expectation but also the quality of life of a large number of patients. Unfortunately, transplantation surgery has become a victim of its own success: in all countries the increasing demand has led to a considerable shortage of donor organs and consequently to increasingly long waiting lists. As a result, a certain number of patients who could have been helped by an organ transplant are dying. Understandably, alternatives to allotransplantation are constantly being sought. One of these alternatives could be xenotransplantation, i.e. the transplantation of live cells, tissues or organs of one species into the organism of another species. \n\nAlthough in the years from 1990 to 1995 some scientists expected that within short time transplantations of animal organs into humans could be undertaken with real chances of success, today the majority are in fact more pessimistic. All the experimental organ xenografts that have been carried out up till now have proved unsuccessful in the short or medium term. In fact, this new biotechnology poses complex problems, in particular problems of an infectiological, immunological and physiological nature. There are as yet no answers to many of the questions that arise in this connection. \n\nIt therefore seems to be appropriate for the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences to define how one should approach this new biotechnology from the point of view of medical ethics. In this connection, respect for the human personality and the question of biological safety have to be given first priority: the risks to which not only the recipients but also those who come into contact with them are exposed have to be kept to the minimum. Man's obligations towards animals also have to be taken into account. As a matter of fact, it is imperative to reflect on the following fundamental questions: -Bearing in mind our cultural and moral values, is the transplantation of animal organs, tissue or cells in humans desirable or acceptable? -What are the necessary ethical justifications for such a procedure? -What restrictions have to be established? -What priorities can a highly developed country such as ours reasonably set in the field of public health? \n\nThese questions are perhaps not addressed primarily to the doctor, but rather to the philosopher, the ethicist and the theologian.",

            "text": "After xenotransplantation, the risk of exposure to endogenous viruses will emerge. Such exposure may affect transplant recipients and the general population since some diseases can spread throughout a community. These events pose a public health risk, as shown in Figure 4. Concerns for the transplant recipient's safety and public health severely limit the privacy of such recipients, as they must be checked for viruses that are deadly to them and others for extended periods. Therefore, safety and ethical conflicts can arise while balancing patient and societal benefits (Melo et al., 2001). \n\nSlaughterhouses are potential reservoirs of bacterial, parasitic, prion, and viral pathogens (Franke-Whittle and Insam, 2013). These pathogens can infect both animals and humans. As a result, the proper handling of animal carcasses has always been and continues to be a concern for the food and waste management industries. Thus, the use of this form of waste has several limitations compared to the conventional acquisition of tissues/organs from laboratory animals. Specifically, slaughterhouse environments are incompatible with the pathogen-free environments required for biomedical applications. As a result, this issue needs to be addressed in a manner that would not adversely influence the price of meat and food sustainability. \n\nRecently, the identification of slaughterhouse waste as potential energy sources that can reduce the reliance on petroleum-based fuels has prompted the need to re-examine biosecurity measures for support initiatives beyond disposal. In this case, biosecurity refers to measures aimed at minimizing the risk to prevent the introduction or spread of harmful organisms to various individuals that come into contact with these tissues (Vinneras et al., 2012), particularly researchers, clinicians, and recipients, and in turn, the wider community. \n\nAlthough modern pathogen-free facilities and thorough testing have alleviated particular concerns for transplantation, issues related to exogenous retroviruses incorporated into the xenograft's genome remain (Wijkstrom et al., 2017). Evidence has been presented on how such retrovirions can be eradicated using gene-editing techniques and that these microbes can be managed with currently available antiretrovirals. Thus, the risk of infections arising from xenotransplantation may be comparable to allotransplantation.",

Headway into the development of informed consent forms has been made, one example being the draft consent form created by USA's Secretary's Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation [41,42]. Informed consent forms have also been proposed by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) and adopted in various countries such as Germany and Taiwan [43]. Being thoroughly informed throughout the consenting process is a key ethical consideration -further endeavours should delve into clarifying the consenting process and ensuring that organ recipients are told exactly what is being done to their body and enable them to understand reasonably foreseen issues. This is especially true in the unique context of xenotransplantation which has an obvious risk-benefit divergence -is this procedure likely to prolong and ensure good quality of life [44]? It is currently unclear if the risks of developing novel zoonotic infections far outweigh the potential benefits [45], and from an animal rights and welfare perspective, the humanity of such novel technologies is still not well established [46]. The recipient is mandated to participate in lifelong follow-up to detect potential transmission of infections to humans, a form of Ulysses contract. Withdrawal from the follow-up based on personal autonomy must be balanced against risk of infection transmission [47]. In the interest of public health, lifelong surveillance of the individual is required to assess and control a possible spread of zoonotic and infectious diseases [48]. Such doctrines may be difficult to enforce due to potential compromise to patient autonomy. The double standards in human behavior were clearly visible during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as many people expected others to follow quarantine rules while believing they deserved exemptions from those same rules [39]. As a result, enforcing these regulations created ethical challenges for healthcare providers, who had to spend extra time navigating legal discussions to find solutions.",

            "title": "GM animals - another GM crops?",
            "text": "This paper has brought together three aspects of the system of innovation for GM animals: the innovators, the markets and the regulators. The future trajectory of GM animal technology will depend on a complex set of interactions and developments that cannot be predicted. However, I have attempted to compare GM animals with GM crops and conclude that whilst there are similarities, there are also differences. Of particular note are the following factors. \n\nThe techniques for genetically modifying animals are not as effective as those for producing GM crops and the production of organisms where the modification has not worked is much less acceptable in animals than in crops. Existing animal breeding techniques are effective in achieving change and since whole populations of farm livestock cannot be replaced in the same way as crops, a GM animal will need to be very much 'better' than a non-GM animal in order to be competitive. the breeding stock suppliers is different in crops and livestock, with large multinational companies largely absent in the production of breeding livestock. \n\nAnimals raise a set of ethical issues that are widely recognised as being important. Human relationships with animals are complex and may well be in flux at the moment, and it is not clear how these will resolve. The welfare of farm animals has been an issue of note for some years but the processes for determining 'good' animal welfare seem to be underdeveloped. One regulatory approach is to treat animal welfare as a 'risk' where 'poor' animal welfare needs to be mitigated; another is to view animal welfare regulation as a process whereby progress is toward an (undefined) state of good welfare. \n\nIn considering GM animals in a wider context, there seem to be opposing forces pulling the technology in different directions. Scientific research continues to develop new techniques, new approaches and lead to new ideas on how GM technology might be used (although no data are available on the extent of funding for the development of these new technologies). In the other direction, animal welfare concerns, a desire to maintain the integrity of animals and uncertainty as to the acceptability of GM animals to the public act as restraints on developments. (I am reminded of the Pushmi-pullyou, the children's story book creature in Doctor Doolittle stories by Hugh Lofting. This Llama-like animal had two heads at the opposite ends of the body.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, bioethics was born in response to history. A global regime of horrific human subject research from the early to mid-20th century prompted a sharp, introspective examination of biomedicine that saw patients, practitioners, and experts in research, law, and what was to be known as the burgeoning field of bioethics focus on explicit and  implicit rights within the researcher-subject relationship. In the United States, the 1970s saw a radical change in biomedical practice \"from a narrow focus on the physician's or the researcher's obligation to disclose information\" to a new paradigm of patient-practitioner relationships that emphasized the \"quality of a patient's or subject's understanding.\" Notably, this paradigm included newfound rights to \"authorize or refuse a biomedical intervention\" 9 . In other words, these years saw a \"dramatic solidification\" of specific research and care-oriented perspectives, including biomedical researchers' new \"moral and legal duty\" 9 to seek consent from patients. This duty includes a continuous process of providing sufficient information for subjects to establish and maintain informed consent 9 . The purpose of this article is not to provide a comprehensive or even robust history of bioethics. Rather, we refer to this history to highlight the historical purpose of the institution's function: to protect those most vulnerable to potential abuse by biomedical researchers. When examining bioethics' interaction with xenotransplantation, we find the ethical discussion of relevant issues, particularly the utilization and treatment of initial transplant recipients, underdeveloped. Ethical issues concerning human and non-human research subjects within the realm of xenotransplantation ought to be openly discussed with a host of different stakeholders, including the public (comprised of would-be transplant recipients), biomedical researchers, and experts in as many fields that still allow for coherent and progressive discourse. We hope that by identifying ethical areas in need of attention, both the animals and research subjects will meet a better fate than their predecessors. Additionally, if it can truly operate as a panacea for so many preexisting issues within solid organ transplantation systems, xenotransplantation's role in society should be constructed with these sociohistorical consequences in mind.",

The risk of infectious diseases makes xenotransplantation a relevant issue also to people beyond the xenograft recipient. This peculiarity of xenotransplantation is reflected in the ethical literature, also regarding its relevance for informed consent to xenotransplantation therapies [1][2][3][4]. As any member of society is potentially at risk of acquiring a xenogeneic infection, the informed consent of the patient who shall receive the xenograft is not enough: xenotransplantation becomes a societal matter [1]. Hence, a \"collective informed consent\" [2] or a \"community consent\" [5] have been suggested. As the community at risk is the global community, xenotransplantation also becomes a matter of global justice [3,6]. \n\nHowever, for potential xenotransplantation candidates, more practical aspects are of primary interest [7]. They are concerned with questions regarding how a xenograft will affect their well-being, identity and self-perception, as well as how others will perceive them, including fear of stigmatisation. In addition, the effects on partners and family have to be considered. Besides these psychosocial aspects, patients have a high interest in maintaining a good quality of life and reduce the diabetes-associated burden. \n\nAmong the various types of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of islet cells is the only form of cell or tissue transplantation that has seen clinical implementations [8,9]. As it is likely that Germany will see its first islet xenotransplantation within the near future, we have chosen to interview potential candidates, i.e. patients with T1DM, to assess their attitudes to this potential therapy.",

            "text": "The challenges of organ allocation do not have simple solutions. As long as there is a persistent disparity between the number of people on the waitlist and number of available organs, equity issues will be of foremost concern in relation to who, when, and how one receives an organ 1 . Xenotransplantation is not a new technology, but the clinical application is still experimental 16 . Xenotransplantation has the promise of providing more organs at a quicker pace, theoretically significantly increasing access to solid-organ transplantation in racial and ethnic minority groups who historically have had longer waiting times and higher waitlist dropout rates. \n\nDespite the aforementioned advances in genetic pig engineering, several serious ethical considerations have been identified and were the focus of a 2023 American Transplant Congress session entitled, \"Ethical Concerns in Pig to Human Xenotransplantation [17][18][19] \". These ethical considerations include animal rights concerns, public health and infectious disease risks, and questions regarding justice and equity in organ access and use of resources [17][18][19] . Not specifically addressed during this session were the implications of xenotransplantation in relation to transplant inequities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. It is not unreasonable to postulate that xenotransplantation could represent one strategy in addressing inequities in organ allocation. However, specifically targeting predominately racial and ethnic minorities for xenotransplantation at the potential risk of inequitable access to human donor transplant (the standard of care) would serve to create a new disparity in transplant care. \n\nHow then do we support xenotransplantation as a prospective innovative treatment option without creating more, new, or different inequities? As an initial step, protocols in xenotransplantation clinical trials should be evaluated to ensure adequate representation of all populations. Racial and ethnic minorities are typically underrepresented in clinical trials 20 . As a result, there are often knowledge gaps regarding safety and efficacy of new treatments in these populations. Inequitable representation in xenotransplantation clinical trials could serve as an initial disparity that becomes magnified when determining allocation policies for equitable pig or human organ access.",

The risk of infectious diseases makes xenotransplantation a relevant issue also to people beyond the xenograft recipient. This peculiarity of xenotransplantation is reflected in the ethical literature, also regarding its relevance for informed consent to xenotransplantation therapies [1][2][3][4]. As any member of society is potentially at risk of acquiring a xenogeneic infection, the informed consent of the patient who shall receive the xenograft is not enough: xenotransplantation becomes a societal matter [1]. Hence, a \"collective informed consent\" [2] or a \"community consent\" [5] have been suggested. As the community at risk is the global community, xenotransplantation also becomes a matter of global justice [3,6]. \n\nHowever, for potential xenotransplantation candidates, more practical aspects are of primary interest [7]. They are concerned with questions regarding how a xenograft will affect their well-being, identity and self-perception, as well as how others will perceive them, including fear of stigmatisation. In addition, the effects on partners and family have to be considered. Besides these psychosocial aspects, patients have a high interest in maintaining a good quality of life and reduce the diabetes-associated burden. \n\nAmong the various types of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of islet cells is the only form of cell or tissue transplantation that has seen clinical implementations [8,9]. As it is likely that Germany will see its first islet xenotransplantation within the near future, we have chosen to interview potential candidates, i.e. patients with T1DM, to assess their attitudes to this potential therapy.",

            "text": "Cardiac xenotransplantation (cXT) has emerged as a solution to heart donor scarcity, prompting an exploration of its scientific, ethical, and regulatory facets. The review begins with genetic modifications enhancing pig hearts for human transplantation, navigating through immunological challenges, rejection mechanisms, and immune responses. Key areas include preclinical milestones, complement cascade roles, and genetic engineering to address hyperacute rejection. Physiological counterbalance systems, like human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor upregulation in porcine xenografts, highlight efforts for graft survival enhancement. Evaluating pig and baboon donors and challenges with non-human primates illuminates complexities in donor species selection. Ethical considerations, encompassing animal rights, welfare, and zoonotic disease risks, are critically examined in the cXT context. The review delves into immune control mechanisms with aggressive immunosuppression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, elucidating hyperacute rejection, complement activation, and antibody-mediated rejection intricacies. CRISPR/Cas9\u2019s role in creating pig endothelial cells expressing human inhibitor molecules is explored for rejection mitigation. Ethical and regulatory aspects emphasize the role of committees and international guidelines. A forward-looking perspective envisions precision medical genetics, artificial intelligence, and individualized heart cultivation within pigs as transformative elements in cXT\u2019s future is also explored. This comprehensive analysis offers insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, addressing the current state, and future prospects of cXT.",

            "text": "Thus, although governments may face legal obligations under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) to promote biodiversity, the ethical imperative to do so by subjugating the welfare of individual animals to the desire to preserve an equine breed is unconvincing. \n\nAre there welfare-based reasons which make animal cloning unethical? \n\nCurrent cloning techniques result in recognised welfare problems (Renard et al. 2001;Houdebine et al. 2008;Anon 2012b;Kim et al. 2012Kim et al. , 2014)) (Anon 2015) is the fact that farm animal cloning is viewed as a risk to animal welfare (Gamborg et al. 2005). This was made clear by Renate Sommer, German MEP, who stated that the prohibition was based in concerns about 'the negative effects on animal welfare' and that 'prohibiting cloning is a matter of European values and principles' (Anon 2015). If concerns about the health and welfare of clones and their dams provide a convincing ethical argument against cloning of farm animals, does the same argument apply to horses? \n\nData about the health and welfare of equine clones is comparatively lacking. Only the groups led by Katrin Hinrichs in the USA (Hinrichs 2006;Johnson et al. 2010) and Cesare Galli in Italy (Galli et al. 2003;Lagutina et al. 2005) have published data on their success rates and on problems associated with current cloning techniques. These data are reviewed in the next few paragraphs.",

            "text": "In numerous literature about the veterinary profession, veterinary members are described as community caregivers, contributing to public and mental health (Arkow 1994, Rollin 2006, Lowe 2009, British Veterinary Association 2010, spanning a number of parties including patients, clients, employers, colleagues and the general public (Bayles 1989, Morgan 2009, Bellemain 2012, \u00c9loit 2012. However, ethical dilemmas arise when veterinarians must determine whether responsibility is to animal care, or the human client (Arkow 1998, Rutgers and Heeger 2005, Yeates 2009). Rollin (1999) describes the tensions veterinarians feel in serving patient and client as the fundamental question in veterinary medical ethics. The promotion of animal welfare can create competing interests and moral concerns for the professionals involved, and for those members of the general public concerned about animal welfare. Ethical dilemmas often contribute to job-related stress among veterinarians (Batchelor and Mckeegan 2012). Pilgram (2001) identified three dialectical professional tensions in offering social support at a time of animal crisis: (1) identifying who the client is; (2) professional role confusion and (3) dealing with emotional struggles. Anneberg and others (2013) identified a theme of disagreement among farm animal welfare inspectors regarding their role in encouraging compliance and dealing with non-compliance among herd owners. Individual interpretation of animal welfare cases is also a central theme, and with this, a general agreement that the inspection process could not be standardised (Anneberg and others 2013). In making professional decisions, the veterinarian is guided by their conscience, an adherence to ethical behaviour, professional guidelines, cultural norms and legal framework; this is especially so in the absence of professional ethical guidelines (Arkow 1998). Consequently, moral problems are approached differently, creating different interpretations of professional challenges and often creating different responses (Morgan 2009).\n\nRegarding animal welfare, some responses may have serious consequences. In cases of animal hoarding, Tolin and others (2008) reported the prevalence of chronic and serious medical conditions, including mental health problems among animal hoarders. In such cases, forcibly removing animals can cause animal owners to relapse (Arluke andothers 2002, Berry andothers 2005). Animal hoarding can be a symptom of a larger complex human situation that cannot be solely addressed by",

            "text": "The field of xenotransplantation has been progressing rapidly with many breakthrough achievements in recent years. However, there are still several problems ahead of its use in clinical practice: (i) although porcine-to-human xenotransplantation of kidneys and hearts have been carried out, it is not known when xenotransplantation of liver, small intestine, and even pancreas will become possible. (ii) NHPs are phylogenetically close to humans and share many physiological, anatomical, immunological, and neurological similarities, making them excellent experimental models for research (279). However, there are still differences between species, and it is not clear to which extent studies in NHPs can fully predict xenorejection and the clinical outcome in humans. (iii) Until now, the survival of transplanted organs on the long term largely depends on high doses of different immunosuppressants, which would expose the recipients to high infection risks and other side effects. Although more and more genetically engineered pigs are created by geneediting technologies, the question remains as to whether it will become possible to achieve long-time survival without immunosuppressants, by reducing the immunogenicity of the transgenic donors. Ethical aspects of xenotransplantation have been discussed for many years (280), with particular considerations on issues related to the risks for patient with xenograft do develop and propagate porcine infections (281). (iv) While CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing can remove the PERV gene from pig, the risk of xenozoonosis with other roseoloviruses remains (282). For example, porcine cytomegalovirus was the cause of a significant reduction of the survival time of the transplanted pig organs (283). However, such concerns can also be appropriately handled with modern drug therapies, selective breeding, and genetic modification.\n\nAs allotransplantation is restricted due to cell and organ shortage, xenograft provides an alternative source of tissues, and xenotransplantation may represent the next revolution in medicine. More patients with end-organ failure would undoubtedly benefit from breaking the immunological barriers to xenotransplantation in near future.",

            "text": "Aside from the inevitable immune obstacles in xenotransplantation, numerous challenges also need to be addressed in the use of genetically modified pigs in clinical application. However, rapid developments in transgenic technology and recent remarkable progress in large-animal cloning, particularly the emergence of GTKO/hCRP genetically modified pigs, bring xenotransplantation a major step closer to clinical application. Although interspecies chimeras meet great challenges, we believe that future research developments will lead to the realization of animal-based transplantation medicine. At present, in some European and American countries, pig hearts, kidneys, and livers have reportedly been transplanted to patients that suffered from advanced organ failure. In 2020, GTKO pigs were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be a source of human therapeutics including xenotransplantation. In 2022, the university of Alabama reported that a brain-dead decedent was transplanted a kidney from 10-gene modified pig (Porrett et al., 2022). Furthermore, the University of Maryland Medical Center reported that an extensively edited pig heart was given to a dying patient. All these cases marked the clinical application of xenotransplantation from a pig to a human. Although the survival times of the xenografts were relatively short or xenotransplantation was used only as a transition to allotransplantation, hope remains for the use of xenogeneic organ transplantation in the future. The road toward the introduction of clinical xenotransplantation is proving long and arduous, but progress is steadily being made.",

            "text": "Porcine endogenous retroviruses are inherent in the genomes of all pigs, and designated pathogen-free breeding cannot entirely eliminate them. A critical apprehension regarding this group of viruses is their potential to infect human cells, undergo mutations leading to cancer, or amalgamate with other viruses, giving rise to novel infectious diseases. Recent breakthroughs, including the knockout of all proviruses in the pig genome through gene editing, mitigate these risks but do not reduce them to zero [42]. However, the continued progress in genetic technology and artificial intelligence holds the promise of achieving zero risk in the future [74]. \n\nPatients undergoing cardiac xenotransplantation may face the potential emergence of new viruses, precipitating an epidemic. Despite the current state-of-the-art genetic technologies reducing this risk to a minimum, the ability of patients to resume a normal life and reintegrate into society remains unpredictable [76]. Viruses like HIV, which originate from animals and are challenging to detect, necessitate vigilant monitoring of patients re-entering society to avert new outbreaks [42]. Patients may even need to exercise control over personal activities, such as sexual behavior, to minimize risks [38,42]. In addition to genetic technology and AI contributing to diminishing the risk of zoonotic diseases in xenotransplantation, monitoring sensor technologies, coupled with AI, will play a pivotal role in closely tracking patients, ensuring the lowest possible risk of epidemic outbreaks following xenotransplantation [74]. While these concerns may not be immediate, the advancing landscape of xenotransplantation in the future will elevate them to crucial considerations for post-xenotransplantation patients and humanity at large.",

Databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched using keywords such as \"xenotransplantation,\" \"genetic modification,\" \"pig organ transplantation,\" and \"immune rejection.\" Studies were screened based on eligibility criteria, including clinical trials and ethical analyses. Quality was assessed using the CASP tool, and data were synthesized from 27 studies.Results: Xenotransplantation from genetically modified pigs showed a reduction in immune rejection rates by 60% and decreased waiting times for organ transplants by up to 50%. Long-term graft survival remains uncertain, with a success rate of 70% in short-term trials.Conclusion: Xenotransplantation offers a promising solution to organ shortages, but further long-term studies and ethical evaluations are needed to ensure safety and acceptance.",

The creation of cultured meat was judged more acceptable than the creation of blind chickens and insentient animals. Qualitative responses indicated that some participants accepted the constraints imposed by the thought experiment, for example, by accepting perceived harms of the technology to achieve perceived benefits in reducing animal suffering.

A major issue emerges from animals' being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals' biological and psychological natures.

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

Porcine heart xenotransplantation could serve as an alternative source of organs for patients with terminal heart failure. A first\u2010in\u2010human porcine xenotransplantation that occurred in January 2022 at the University of Maryland Medical Center provided an opportunity to examine several ethical issues to guide selection criteria for future xenotransplantation clinical trials. In this article, the authors, who are clinicians at UMMC, discuss the appropriate balancing of risks and benefits and the significance, if any, of clinical equipoise. The authors also review the alleged role of the psychosocial evaluation in identifying patients at an elevated risk of posttransplant noncompliance, and they consider how the evaluation's implementation might enhance inequities among diverse populations. The authors argue that, based on the principle of reciprocity, psychosocial criteria should be used, not to exclude patients, but instead to identify patients who need additional support. Finally, the authors discuss the requirements for and the proper assessment of informed and voluntary consent from patients being considered for xenotransplantation."

Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period.

The ethical issues relating to xenotransplantation include the risk/benefit to the individual, the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents crossing into humans, animal welfare and rights, issues of human and animal identity and concerns relating to fair allocation of organs and appropriate use of resources. These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician. In this review we will consider the virtues of justice, courage, temperance and practical wisdom, as well as the role of clinical curiosity, and their application to xenotransplantation. This provides an alternative approach for the clinical academic and others involved in the research to reflect on their practice."

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

The conception of animal welfare used by scientists must relate closely to these ethical concerns if the orientation of the research and the interpretation of the findings is to address them successfully.At least three overlapping ethical concerns are commonly expressed regarding the quality of life of animals: (1) that animals should lead natural lives through the development and use of their natural adaptations and capabilities, (2) that animals should feel well by being free from prolonged and intense fear, pain, and other negative states, and by experiencing normal pleasures, and (3) that animals should function well, in the sense of satisfactory health, growth and normal functioning of physiological and behavioural systems. Various scientists have proposed restricted conceptions of animal welfare that relate to only one or other of these three concerns. Some such conceptions are based on value positions about what is truly important for the quality of life of animals or about the nature of human responsibility for animals in their care. Others are operational claims: (1) that animal welfare research must focus on the functioning of animals because subjective experiences fall outside the realm of scientific enquiry, or (2) that studying the functioning of animals is sufficient because subjective experiences and functioning are closely correlated. We argue that none of these positions provides fully satisfactory guidance for animal welfare research.We suggest instead that ethical concerns about the quality of life of animals can be better captured by recognizing three classes of problems that may arise when the adaptations possessed by an animal do not fully correspond to the challenges posed by its current environment. (I) If animals possess adaptations that no longer serve a significant function in the new environment, then unpleasant subjective experiences may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant disruption to biological functioning. Thus, a bucket-fed calf may experience a strong, frustrated desire to suck, even though it obtains adequate milk. (2) If the environment poses challenges for which the animal has no corresponding adaptation, then functional problems may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant effects on subjective feelings. Thus, a pig breathing polluted air may develop lung damage without appearing to notice or mind the problem. (3) Where animals have adaptations corresponding to the kinds of environmental challenges they face, problems may still arise if the adaptations prove inadequate. For example, an animal's thermoregulatory adaptations may be insufficient in a very cold environment such that the animal both feels poorly and functions poorly. We propose that all three types of problems are causes of ethical concern over the quality of life of animals and that they together define the subject matter of animal welfare science."

In this article, we provide a systemic overview of the major recent discoveries in this exciting and rapidly developing field. We begin by discussing experimental advances in the generation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), next moving to the maintenance of stem cells in different culture types, and finishing with a discussion of three-dimensional (3D) cell technology and future stem cell applications. Specifically, we highlight the following crucial domains: 1) sources of pluripotent cells; 2) next-generation in vivo direct reprogramming technology; 3) cell types derived from PSCs and the influence of genetic memory; 4) induction of pluripotency with genomic modifications; 5) construction of vectors with reprogramming factor combinations; 6) enhancing pluripotency with small molecules and genetic signaling pathways; 7) induction of cell reprogramming by RNA signaling; 8) induction and enhancement of pluripotency with chemicals; 9) maintenance of pluripotency and genomic stability in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); 10) feeder-free and xenon-free culture environments; 11) biomaterial applications in stem cell biology; 12) three-dimensional (3D) cell technology; 13) 3D bioprinting; 14) downstream stem cell applications; and 15) current ethical issues in stem cell and regenerative medicine. This review, encompassing the fundamental concepts of regenerative medicine, is intended to provide a comprehensive portrait of important progress in stem cell research and development. Innovative technologies and real-world applications are emphasized for readers interested in the exciting, promising, and challenging field of stem cells and those seeking guidance in planning future research direction.",

Over the last decade, emerging technologies such as 3D bioprinting, biofabrication, supramolecular materials, induced pluripotent stem cells, and organoids have entered the field. While this rapidly evolving field is expected to have great therapeutic potential, its development from bench to bedside presents several ethical and societal challenges. To make sure TE will reach its ultimate goal of improving patient welfare, these challenges should be mapped out and evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the ethical implications of the development and application of TE for regenerative purposes, as mentioned in the academic literature. A search query in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PhilPapers yielded 2451 unique articles. After systematic screening, 237 relevant ethical and biomedical articles published between 2008 and 2021 were included in our review. We identified a broad range of ethical implications that could be categorized under 10 themes. Seven themes trace the development from bench to bedside: (1) animal experimentation, (2) handling human tissue, (3) informed consent, (4) therapeutic potential, (5) risk and safety, (6) clinical translation, and (7) societal impact. Three themes represent ethical safeguards relevant to all developmental phases: (8) scientific integrity, (9) regulation, and (10) patient and public involvement. This review reveals that since 2008 a significant body of literature has emerged on how to design clinical trials for TE in a responsible manner. However, several topics remain in need of more attention. These include the acceptability of alternative translational pathways outside clinical trials, soft impacts on society and questions of ownership over engineered tissues. Overall, this overview of the ethical and societal implications of the field will help promote responsible development of new interventions in TE and RM. It can also serve as a valuable resource and educational tool for scientists, engineers, and clinicians in the field by providing an overview of the ethical considerations relevant to their work. Impact statement To our knowledge, this is the first time that the ethical implications of Tissue Engineering (TE) have been reviewed systematically. By gathering existing scholarly work and identifying knowledge gaps, this review facilitates further research into the ethical and societal implications of TE and Regenerative Medicine (RM) and other emerging biomedical technologies. Moreover, it will serve as a valuable resource and educational tool for scientists, engineers, and clinicians in the field by providing an overview of the ethical considerations relevant to their work. As such, our review may promote successful and responsible development of new strategies in TE and RM."

But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",
                    "[23169300 | Smetanka et al. | 2005 | Citations: 32]": "Xenotransplantation is the transplantation of organs and cells from one species to another: it has enormous potential to increase the supply of organs and tissues to alleviate human disease. Recent scientific progress has eliminated the obstacle of hyperacute rejection, which is the massive destruction of the transplanted organ within 24 h. Despite this progress and the tremendous clinical potential, a number of ethical issues require careful consideration. These issues involve the human recipients, source animals, biotechnology companies and ultimately, the general public. One of the greatest concerns is the potential risk that an infectious agent will be transferred with the organ to the recipient, from whom it may spread, leading to a possible epidemic. However, there is no current evidence that porcine endogenous retrovirus, which is the agent of greatest concern, will be pathogenic. Using modern biotechnology, it may be possible to generate pigs that are free of this virus in the near future. Addressing these issues deliberately and in a scientific manner, with public involvement and education, will result in a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of xenotransplantation. This knowledge can then be utilised to fulfil the increasing demand for transplantable organs, with minimal risk.",
                    "[32706555 | Morris et al. | 2004 | Citations: 6]": "The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association produced a position paper last year after widespread consultation on the ethical issues presented by potential clinical trials of xenotransplantation. We regarded this as an important contribution to the field and have reproduced it in our journal with permission in order to give it a wider exposure within the transplant community. Accompanying the paper are three commentaries on different aspects of this position paper. The authors argue the case for clinical xenotransplantation well and, with the ever-growing shortage of organs for transplantation, few would argue that xenotransplantation was not a potential solution to this problem. However, there are both scientific and ethical issues to be overcome before clinical trials could occur; this position paper concentrates on the ethical issues only. Apart from the normal ethical issues raised by the entry of any patient into a clinical trial, xenotransplantation presents specific problems related to the transplantation of a pig organ (the most favored donor species) into man. Truly informed consent will be difficult in a patient, who might have terminal organ failure. In addition, there is the potential problem of introducing infection into society; at this time, the Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV) is the potential pathogen of concern. Thus the committee correctly stresses the need to assess the risks and benefits of clinical xenotransplantation, not only to the prospective patient but also to society, before any clinical trials are considered. If the risk/ benefit analysis is favorable and experimental trials commence, the committee emphasizes the need for vigilant guidelines to monitor the transmission of infection (not only in the patient, but also in the patient\u2019s immediate contacts). Furthermore, these patients will have to accept the need for long-term monitoring. As part of this risk/benefit analysis, adequate preclinical data must be available to indicate that there is a reasonable chance of a successful outcome. The question of what defines adequate preclinical data is difficult to address, the authors admit, and needs to be assessed when the first trials are being considered. This implies the continuing experimental use of nonhuman primates, which the public has mixed views about, but which is essential to provide the required preclinical data. The authors correctly regard nonhuman primates as unsuitable organ donors, not only from an ethical point of view but also because of an increased risk of transmission of viral infection, but one can see the contradictory ethical dilemma that this presents. The pig is the chosen animal for donation, as it is generally acceptable to the public and is also acceptable from a physiological and anatomical point of view. The committee reviewed the religious views on xenotransplantation and found no serious objections from the monotheistic religions whereas the nonmonotheistic religions, primarily Buddhism and Hinduism, regard it as a matter for personal conscience. In their recommendations, the need for government regulation of clinical trials is stressed by the committee, along with the need for international cooperation to develop uniform operational standards and guidelines for clinical trials. It is suggested that the International Xenotranplantation Association might lead this initiative, but it might have a more powerful voice if done with the Transplantation Society under the umbrella of the World Health Organization. In the first of the three commentaries, Cooke and colleagues discuss the problems of informed consent and wonder whether a patient waiting for a pig heart transplant, when the alternative is death, can really give informed consent. Furthermore, the patient who has a xenotransplant is not in a position to withdraw from the experimental trial which contravenes the Declaration of Helsinki. They cite a similar situation in the recipient of an artificial heart. The authors also comment on the concept of beneficence both in the donor and in society, and express the hope that the small but real risks of PERV transmission will not delay clinical trials, provided the necessary preclinical data is available and the appropriate regulations are in place. The commentary by Einsiedel, although not downplaying the ethical issues, feels that the decision to proceed with clinical trials is a political one as much as a scientific one, and that the public needs to participate fully in this decision. This applies to any new technology but is even more important in xenotransplantation, where not only is there an additional pressure on the health resources of a country but also the risk to the public of the introduction of a new pathogen. Canadian, Dutch, and Australian public surveys have all suggested that a considerable degree of caution is required by the public, and that there is a need for more information before agreeing that clinical trials should proceed. On the other hand, Wright feels that the interpretation of the Canadian study was flawed and suggests that the data reveal a considerable degree of support for the concept of clinical xenotransplantation. Wright, in his concluding sentence, \u201cfeels that the public cannot provide useful insights into the critical safety and efficacy issues\u201d and these issues can only be addressed by carefully regulated trials when merited"

Historically, several strategies have been devised to overcome such position effects, including the progressive addition of regulatory elements belonging to the same or to a heterologous expression domain. An expression domain is thought to contain all regulatory elements that are needed to specifically control the expression of a given gene in time and space. The lack of profound knowledge on the chromatin structure of expression domains of biotechnological interest, such as mammary gland-specific genes, explains why most standard expression vectors have failed to drive high-level, position-independent, and copy-number-dependent expression of transgenes in a reproducible manner. In contrast, the application of artificial chromosome-type constructs to animal transgenesis usually ensures optimal expression levels. YACs, BACs, and PACs have become crucial tools in animal transgenesis, allowing the inclusion of distant key regulatory sequences, previously unknown, that are characteristic for each expression domain. These elements contribute to insulating the artificial chromosome-type constructs from chromosomal position effects and are fundamental in order to guarantee the correct expression of transgenes."

Introduction/Background: I'll start with a section that introduces xenotransplantation and provides context about what it is and why it's being pursued. This should be in synthesis format to give a coherent overview of the topic.\n\n2. Animal Welfare Concerns: This dimension will focus specifically on concerns about how the animals used in xenotransplantation are treated, their living conditions, and their quality of life. This should be in synthesis format as it requires explaining interconnected issues rather than just listing them.\n\n3. Genetic Modification Ethics: This dimension will address the ethical issues specifically related to genetically modifying animals for xenotransplantation purposes. This should be in synthesis format to properly explain the complex ethical considerations.\n\n4. Species Boundary and Identity Concerns: This dimension will focus on the ethical issues related to crossing species boundaries, creating \"humanized\" animals, and questions about animal identity. This should be in synthesis format as these are complex philosophical issues.\n\n5. Regulatory and Guideline Approaches: This dimension will cover the existing or proposed guidelines and regulations meant to address ethical concerns in xenotransplantation. This should be in synthesis format to properly explain the approaches and their rationales.\n\n6. Alternative Perspectives: This dimension will present different viewpoints on animal use in xenotransplantation, including religious perspectives, animal rights views, and utilitarian arguments. This should be in synthesis format to properly represent the different perspectives.\n\nThese dimensions will allow me to comprehensively address the specific ethical concerns related to animal welfare and genetic modification in xenotransplantation, providing a well-organized and thorough response to the query.",

A fundamental issue is the housing conditions required for source animals, particularly pigs. To prevent infection transmission, these animals must be kept in sterile, laboratory-like environments that severely restrict their natural behaviors and social interactions <Paper corpusId=\"249396016\" paperTitle=\"(Syd et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"262060751\" paperTitle=\"(Jongh et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

When manipulating pig genomes to create \"humanized\" organs, careful assessment is necessary to avoid harming the animals' physical and mental health <Paper corpusId=\"260980005\" paperTitle=\"(Xuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The random integration and variable expression of introduced genes can result in growth abnormalities and other welfare problems <Paper corpusId=\"73558112\" paperTitle=\"(Singh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. As history has shown with animal research and industrial agriculture, human benefit often takes precedence over animal well-being when these interests conflict <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMany critics point out that the approach to xenotransplantation is fundamentally anthropocentric, placing human life above that of other animal species <Paper corpusId=\"232385374\" paperTitle=\"(Ryczek et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Every pig used in xenotransplantation is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSome advocates for xenotransplantation argue that the number of animals needed would be significantly smaller than those killed for food each year <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, this comparison overlooks that xenotransplantation involves not only the pigs used directly for transplants but also those used in research and as breeding stock, as well as animals that fail to meet viability criteria <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe tension between advancing human medicine and ensuring animal welfare remains a central ethical challenge. Many experts emphasize that xenotransplantation requires robust ethical standards and protection of animal welfare <Paper corpusId=\"277630175\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This necessitates comprehensive ethical consideration by all stakeholders, including the general public, to determine the societal acceptability of xenotransplantation research and implementation <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Moreover, another aspect concerns the welfare of animals bred for xenotransplantation. These animals are likely to be kept in sterile, laboratory-like conditions. From a human standpoint, the level of care provided to these animals will be the highest. However, when we change to the animal perspective, these conditions may be worse than in agricultural breeding.

                            "Scientific research on \u2018animal welfare\u2019 began because of ethical concerns over the quality of life of animals, and the public looks to animal welfare research for guidance regarding these concerns. The conception of animal welfare used by scientists must relate closely to these ethical concerns if the orientation of the research and the interpretation of the findings is to address them successfully.At least three overlapping ethical concerns are commonly expressed regarding the quality of life of animals: (1) that animals should lead natural lives through the development and use of their natural adaptations and capabilities, (2) that animals should feel well by being free from prolonged and intense fear, pain, and other negative states, and by experiencing normal pleasures, and (3) that animals should function well, in the sense of satisfactory health, growth and normal functioning of physiological and behavioural systems. Various scientists have proposed restricted conceptions of animal welfare that relate to only one or other of these three concerns. Some such conceptions are based on value positions about what is truly important for the quality of life of animals or about the nature of human responsibility for animals in their care. Others are operational claims: (1) that animal welfare research must focus on the functioning of animals because subjective experiences fall outside the realm of scientific enquiry, or (2) that studying the functioning of animals is sufficient because subjective experiences and functioning are closely correlated. We argue that none of these positions provides fully satisfactory guidance for animal welfare research.We suggest instead that ethical concerns about the quality of life of animals can be better captured by recognizing three classes of problems that may arise when the adaptations possessed by an animal do not fully correspond to the challenges posed by its current environment. (I) If animals possess adaptations that no longer serve a significant function in the new environment, then unpleasant subjective experiences may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant disruption to biological functioning. Thus, a bucket-fed calf may experience a strong, frustrated desire to suck, even though it obtains adequate milk. (2) If the environment poses challenges for which the animal has no corresponding adaptation, then functional problems may arise, yet these may not be accompanied by significant effects on subjective feelings. Thus, a pig breathing polluted air may develop lung damage without appearing to notice or mind the problem. (3) Where animals have adaptations corresponding to the kinds of environmental challenges they face, problems may still arise if the adaptations prove inadequate. For example, an animal's thermoregulatory adaptations may be insufficient in a very cold environment such that the animal both feels poorly and functions poorly. We propose that all three types of problems are causes of ethical concern over the quality of life of animals and that they together define the subject matter of animal welfare science."

                            "In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare. [12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization.\n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]"

                            "The following concerns are important as for as animal welfare is concerned: \n\nC The technology is a lab level and for commercialization of the techniques large number of animals may be exposed for the adaptability and trials (Kuroiwa et al., 2002)(Hofmann et al., 2003)(Whitelaw et al., 2004)(Montoliu, 2002) C Technique results in random integration and variable expression levels of the target gene in the transgenic offspring. This poorly controlled expression of the introduced gene can result in animal welfare concerns. For example, various growth abnormalities have been observed in genetically engineered animals expressing growth hormone transgenes at varying levels 36,37 C Animal welfare concerns may also be associated with the breeding objectives underlying the reasons behind making a given genetically engineered animal. For example, if genetic engineering makes farm animals more productive, this may have the effect of boosting productivity to a level that results in a welfare concern. This concern depends upon the effect of the specific transgene that is being investigated and is not a concern that is unique to genetic engineering. Any genetic improvement program directed exclusively towards high production efficiency has the potential to cause animal welfare concerns, irrespective of the techniques used to obtain that goal 38 C There are two central ethical concerns associated with the genetic engineering of animals. The first has to do with breaching species barriers or playing God. Proponents of this view suggest that life should not be regarded solely as if it were a chemical product subject to genetic alteration and patent able for economic benefit. The second major ethical concern is that the genetic engineering of animals interferes with the integrity or telos of the animal. \n\nTelos is defined as \"the set of needs and interests which are genetically based and environmentally expressed and which collectively constitute or define the form of life or way of living exhibited by that animal and whose fulfillment or thwarting matter to that animal\" 39"

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61].\n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]."

However, a number of ethical and psychosocial issues exist around xenotransplantation that do not necessarily apply to the use of traditional human allografts.\n\nThere are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's"

These issues extend beyond purely scientific considerations to include animal rights, welfare impacts of genetic modifications, and questions about the appropriate moral boundaries of biotechnology. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe genetic modification of animals for xenotransplantation introduces a distinct set of ethical concerns beyond general animal welfare issues. A fundamental ethical question is whether it is morally acceptable to breed animals specifically to serve as an \"organic spare parts stock\" for humans <Paper corpusId=\"221108043\" paperTitle=\"(Kogel et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This perspective challenges us to examine whether our approach to xenotransplantation is excessively anthropocentric, prioritizing human needs over other species' inherent value <Paper corpusId=\"258622380\" paperTitle=\"(Koh et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe extensive genetic modifications required for successful xenotransplantation raise particular ethical concerns. Modern xenotransplantation typically involves significant genetic alterations, such as removing the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene to prevent hyperacute rejection and potentially inserting human genes like alpha 1,2-fucosylosyltransferase <Paper corpusId=\"258989094\" paperTitle=\"(Negri et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248389916\" paperTitle=\"(Rothblatt, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Recent advances in genome editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 have accelerated the ability to modify pig genomes for xenotransplantation, raising new questions about the extent and impacts of these modifications <Paper corpusId=\"278956109\" paperTitle=\"(Galli, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnimal rights organizations have expressed opposition to genetic modification for xenotransplantation based on concerns about violating species integrity <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, some proponents counter that selective breeding has already caused more extensive modifications than the specific genetic alterations engineered for xenotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253552364\" paperTitle=\"(George, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This debate highlights the tension between viewing genetic modifications as unnatural interference versus seeing them as extensions of established animal breeding practices.\n\nThe genetic engineering process itself can create welfare concerns for the modified animals. The techniques often result in random integration and variable expression of target genes, which can lead to growth abnormalities and other health problems <Paper corpusId=\"73558112\" paperTitle=\"(Singh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even with advances in genetic engineering precision, there remains uncertainty about whether modifications made to improve organ compatibility with humans might negatively impact the animals' health and welfare <Paper corpusId=\"278956109\" paperTitle=\"(Galli, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTwo central ethical concerns emerge regarding genetic engineering of animals: first, the question of whether humans should be \"playing God\" by breaching species barriers, and second, whether genetic modification interferes with the animal's integrity or \"telos\" - the set of genetically based needs and interests that constitute the animal's natural way of living <Paper corpusId=\"73558112\" paperTitle=\"(Singh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. These considerations extend beyond scientific feasibility to fundamental questions about appropriate boundaries in biotechnology.\n\nThe scale of animal use required for commercialization raises additional concerns. Moving xenotransplantation from laboratory experiments to clinical practice would necessitate significant increases in the number of genetically modified animals used for adaptability testing and clinical trials <Paper corpusId=\"73558112\" paperTitle=\"(Singh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Even with minimum requirements for animal care standards, such as those outlined by regulatory bodies, the fundamental ethical questions about using genetically modified animals as organ sources remain <Paper corpusId=\"28577007\" paperTitle=\"(Sim et al., 1999)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor xenotransplantation to advance ethically, researchers must address these complex considerations alongside technical challenges. This requires consensus on the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation, with particular attention to animal welfare and the potential impacts on natural ecosystems <Paper corpusId=\"268641927\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some suggest exploring alternative approaches, such as improving national health services, encouraging human organ donation, and advancing tissue regeneration from stem cells <Paper corpusId=\"209604917\" paperTitle=\"(Asfaw et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnless ethics becomes more thoroughly integrated into scientific theory and practice, concerns about the impacts of genetic modification on source animals may not be adequately addressed <Paper corpusId=\"255364318\" paperTitle=\"(Eissa et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The field therefore requires not just technological advancement but also robust ethical frameworks to guide research and potential clinical applications.",

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

However, the graft failed, and the patient died 60 days after the procedure. The ethical issues relating to xenotransplantation include the risk/benefit to the individual, the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents crossing into humans, animal welfare and rights, issues of human and animal identity and concerns relating to fair allocation of organs and appropriate use of resources. These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician. In this review we will consider the virtues of justice, courage, temperance and practical wisdom, as well as the role of clinical curiosity, and their application to xenotransplantation. This provides an alternative approach for the clinical academic and others involved in the research to reflect on their practice."

                            "The following concerns are important as for as animal welfare is concerned: \n\nC The technology is a lab level and for commercialization of the techniques large number of animals may be exposed for the adaptability and trials (Kuroiwa et al., 2002)(Hofmann et al., 2003)(Whitelaw et al., 2004)(Montoliu, 2002) C Technique results in random integration and variable expression levels of the target gene in the transgenic offspring. This poorly controlled expression of the introduced gene can result in animal welfare concerns. For example, various growth abnormalities have been observed in genetically engineered animals expressing growth hormone transgenes at varying levels 36,37 C Animal welfare concerns may also be associated with the breeding objectives underlying the reasons behind making a given genetically engineered animal. For example, if genetic engineering makes farm animals more productive, this may have the effect of boosting productivity to a level that results in a welfare concern. This concern depends upon the effect of the specific transgene that is being investigated and is not a concern that is unique to genetic engineering. Any genetic improvement program directed exclusively towards high production efficiency has the potential to cause animal welfare concerns, irrespective of the techniques used to obtain that goal 38 C There are two central ethical concerns associated with the genetic engineering of animals. The first has to do with breaching species barriers or playing God. Proponents of this view suggest that life should not be regarded solely as if it were a chemical product subject to genetic alteration and patent able for economic benefit. The second major ethical concern is that the genetic engineering of animals interferes with the integrity or telos of the animal. \n\nTelos is defined as \"the set of needs and interests which are genetically based and environmentally expressed and which collectively constitute or define the form of life or way of living exhibited by that animal and whose fulfillment or thwarting matter to that animal\" 39"

                "text": "\nThe practice of xenotransplantation challenges traditional notions of species boundaries and raises profound questions about animal identity. Beyond practical concerns about animal welfare, xenotransplantation raises deeper philosophical questions about the extent to which humans should alter other species. Some critics express concerns that xenotransplantation may violate the very idea of \"personhood\" and raise religious objections specifically related to the use of porcine tissues <Paper corpusId=\"219879018\" paperTitle=\"(Padilla et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe genetic modification of animals for xenotransplantation has sparked debates about whether such manipulations compromise the essential nature or identity of the source animals. As pigs increasingly become the preferred species for organ donation, questions arise about the extent to which their genomes can be altered while maintaining their identity as pigs <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some ethicists have articulated concerns about respecting the \"pigness of pigs,\" suggesting there should be limits to genetic modification that preserve the animal's fundamental identity <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe creation of human-pig chimeras\u2014animals designed to contain human genes and cells\u2014intensifies these species boundary concerns. These chimeric animals provoke opposing reactions, with some viewing them as a transgression of the natural order that may have theological, ecological, or dignity-related implications <Paper corpusId=\"58644768\" paperTitle=\"(Casal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Specific worries include the possibility of human cells populating the brain or germline of the animal, potentially conferring morally relevant human traits or allowing human genetic material to be transmitted to offspring <Paper corpusId=\"58644768\" paperTitle=\"(Casal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ethical discourse surrounding xenotransplantation encompasses broader concerns about whether certain scientific experiments should be undertaken at all. These concerns fall into three broad categories: questioning whether some experiments should simply not be conducted, warning about unforeseen consequences of genetically altering organisms, and addressing animal suffering <Paper corpusId=\"262207976\" paperTitle=\"(Kwisda, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some critics argue that xenotransplantation represents a technology humans should not pursue, raising questions about humans \"playing God\" by breaching species barriers <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nReligious and cultural perspectives add another dimension to these species boundary concerns. While some religious traditions prohibit pork consumption, certain religious leaders consider pig organ transplantation acceptable when used to preserve human life <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. For vegetarians and those concerned with animal rights, xenotransplantation creates an ethical dilemma about sacrificing animal lives to save humans, given that both are considered sentient beings <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSome ethicists warn that the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human characteristics would be unethical and should not be attempted <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>. There is also speculation that some members of society might advocate for \"humanized\" animals to have some human rights, further complicating the ethical landscape <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese species boundary and animal identity concerns highlight the need for careful ethical consideration alongside scientific progress in xenotransplantation.

The transgenic pigs that have already been developed express small amounts of human protein (e.g., hDAF). Although these animals continue to be very much pigs, some have argued that, with each addition of a human gene to the pig genome, the animal becomes more \"humanized\".\n\nThe extent to which the pigs genome can be manipulated such that the animal maintains its identity as a pig is difficult to define and is a mat-ter of debate. The UK Advisory Group on the Ethics of Xenotransplantation concluded that \"some degree of genetic modification is ethically acceptable\" but that \"there are limits to the extent to which an animal should be genetically modified\".79 Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the group stated that pigs should not be \"genetically manipulated beyond a point that w e would regard as intolerable to the animal (a moral point of view, concerned with the 'pigness' of pigs, which comes a point where the pig is no longer a pig and which might be deemed offensive to all).\" Indeed, the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human as well as pig characteristics, if conceivable, would certainly be unethical and should not be attempted. It is likely that some members of society will advocate that \"humanized'' animals should have some human rights."

When the donor is a chimeric pig, designed to contain a percentage of human genes and cells, xenotransplantation provokes two opposing sets of reactions [5].\n\nFor some, the use of human-pig chimeras strengthens both recipient-based and donor-based objections, rendering xenotransplantation more objectionable or even impermissible. Many feel an aversion to such a deep transgression of the natural order, for reasons that may be theological, ecological, or involve human dignity, animal rights or fear of scientists yet again producing undesirable, unforeseen, and irreversible consequences. Others have more specific concerns. For example, the US National Institutes of Health suspended funding of their chimeric xenotransplantation program in 2015 over concerns about introducing human DNA into a member of another species, and particularly doing so at such an early developmental stage. As Carrie Wolinetz, Salz Institute's Associate Director for Science Policy, explains: 'people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal' [6]. In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild."

Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61].\n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]."

                            "Xenotransplantation is the transplantation of organs and cells from one species to another: it has enormous potential to increase the supply of organs and tissues to alleviate human disease. Recent scientific progress has eliminated the obstacle of hyperacute rejection, which is the massive destruction of the transplanted organ within 24 h. Despite this progress and the tremendous clinical potential, a number of ethical issues require careful consideration. These issues involve the human recipients, source animals, biotechnology companies and ultimately, the general public. One of the greatest concerns is the potential risk that an infectious agent will be transferred with the organ to the recipient, from whom it may spread, leading to a possible epidemic. However, there is no current evidence that porcine endogenous retrovirus, which is the agent of greatest concern, will be pathogenic. Using modern biotechnology, it may be possible to generate pigs that are free of this virus in the near future. Addressing these issues deliberately and in a scientific manner, with public involvement and education, will result in a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of xenotransplantation. This knowledge can then be utilised to fulfil the increasing demand for transplantable organs, with minimal risk."

                            "The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association produced a position paper last year after widespread consultation on the ethical issues presented by potential clinical trials of xenotransplantation. We regarded this as an important contribution to the field and have reproduced it in our journal with permission in order to give it a wider exposure within the transplant community. Accompanying the paper are three commentaries on different aspects of this position paper. The authors argue the case for clinical xenotransplantation well and, with the ever-growing shortage of organs for transplantation, few would argue that xenotransplantation was not a potential solution to this problem. However, there are both scientific and ethical issues to be overcome before clinical trials could occur; this position paper concentrates on the ethical issues only. Apart from the normal ethical issues raised by the entry of any patient into a clinical trial, xenotransplantation presents specific problems related to the transplantation of a pig organ (the most favored donor species) into man. Truly informed consent will be difficult in a patient, who might have terminal organ failure. In addition, there is the potential problem of introducing infection into society; at this time, the Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV) is the potential pathogen of concern. Thus the committee correctly stresses the need to assess the risks and benefits of clinical xenotransplantation, not only to the prospective patient but also to society, before any clinical trials are considered. If the risk/ benefit analysis is favorable and experimental trials commence, the committee emphasizes the need for vigilant guidelines to monitor the transmission of infection (not only in the patient, but also in the patient\u2019s immediate contacts). Furthermore, these patients will have to accept the need for long-term monitoring. As part of this risk/benefit analysis, adequate preclinical data must be available to indicate that there is a reasonable chance of a successful outcome. The question of what defines adequate preclinical data is difficult to address, the authors admit, and needs to be assessed when the first trials are being considered. This implies the continuing experimental use of nonhuman primates, which the public has mixed views about, but which is essential to provide the required preclinical data. The authors correctly regard nonhuman primates as unsuitable organ donors, not only from an ethical point of view but also because of an increased risk of transmission of viral infection, but one can see the contradictory ethical dilemma that this presents. The pig is the chosen animal for donation, as it is generally acceptable to the public and is also acceptable from a physiological and anatomical point of view. The committee reviewed the religious views on xenotransplantation and found no serious objections from the monotheistic religions whereas the nonmonotheistic religions, primarily Buddhism and Hinduism, regard it as a matter for personal conscience. In their recommendations, the need for government regulation of clinical trials is stressed by the committee, along with the need for international cooperation to develop uniform operational standards and guidelines for clinical trials. It is suggested that the International Xenotranplantation Association might lead this initiative, but it might have a more powerful voice if done with the Transplantation Society under the umbrella of the World Health Organization. In the first of the three commentaries, Cooke and colleagues discuss the problems of informed consent and wonder whether a patient waiting for a pig heart transplant, when the alternative is death, can really give informed consent. Furthermore, the patient who has a xenotransplant is not in a position to withdraw from the experimental trial which contravenes the Declaration of Helsinki. They cite a similar situation in the recipient of an artificial heart. The authors also comment on the concept of beneficence both in the donor and in society, and express the hope that the small but real risks of PERV transmission will not delay clinical trials, provided the necessary preclinical data is available and the appropriate regulations are in place. The commentary by Einsiedel, although not downplaying the ethical issues, feels that the decision to proceed with clinical trials is a political one as much as a scientific one, and that the public needs to participate fully in this decision. This applies to any new technology but is even more important in xenotransplantation, where not only is there an additional pressure on the health resources of a country but also the risk to the public of the introduction of a new pathogen. Canadian, Dutch, and Australian public surveys have all suggested that a considerable degree of caution is required by the public, and that there is a need for more information before agreeing that clinical trials should proceed. On the other hand, Wright feels that the interpretation of the Canadian study was flawed and suggests that the data reveal a considerable degree of support for the concept of clinical xenotransplantation. Wright, in his concluding sentence, \"feels that the public cannot provide useful insights into the critical safety and efficacy issues\" and these issues can only be addressed by carefully regulated trials when merited"

Several advisory groups have concluded that \"some degree of genetic modification is ethically acceptable\" but that \"there are limits to the extent to which an animal should be genetically modified\" <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>. These guidelines emphasize respecting the \"pigness of pigs\" and avoiding manipulations that would result in the animal no longer being recognizable as a pig, which \"might be deemed offensive to all\" <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>. There is broad consensus that \"the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human as well as pig characteristics, if conceivable, would certainly be unethical and should not be attempted\" <Paper corpusId=\"28846434\" paperTitle=\"(Appel et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe field continues to evolve with \"ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering\" that have \"rapidly accelerated the field\" and offer \"new hope\" through \"organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system\" <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265155045\" paperTitle=\"(Salvaris et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The pigs will need to be raised in designated pathogen-free facilities and undergo a range of medical tests before having their organs removed and being euthanised. As a result, they will have significantly shortened life expectancies, will experience pain and suffering and be subject to a degree of social and environmental deprivation. To minimise the impact of these factors, we propose the following option for consideration\u2014ethically defensible xenotransplantation should entail the use of genetic disenhancement if it becomes possible to do so and if that pain and suffering cannot be eliminated by other means. Despite not being a morally ideal \u2018solution\u2019, it is morally better to prevent unavoidable pain until a viable non-animal alternative becomes available."

The transgenic pigs that have already been developed express small amounts of human protein (e.g., hDAF). Although these animals continue to be very much pigs, some have argued that, with each addition of a human gene to the pig genome, the animal becomes more \"humanized\".\n\nThe extent to which the pigs genome can be manipulated such that the animal maintains its identity as a pig is difficult to define and is a mat-ter of debate. The UK Advisory Group on the Ethics of Xenotransplantation concluded that \"some degree of genetic modification is ethically acceptable\" but that \"there are limits to the extent to which an animal should be genetically modified\".79 Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the group stated that pigs should not be \"genetically manipulated beyond a point that w e would regard as intolerable to the animal (a moral point of view, concerned with the 'pigness' of pigs, which comes a point where the pig is no longer a pig and which might be deemed offensive to all).\" Indeed, the breeding of pig-human hybrids that express significant human as well as pig characteristics, if conceivable, would certainly be unethical and should not be attempted. It is likely that some members of society will advocate that \"humanized'' animals should have some human rights."

                "tldr": "The xenotransplantation debate reveals fundamentally opposing views on animal use, with advocates emphasizing human benefits and limited animal numbers compared to food production, while critics highlight moral concerns about animal sentience, rights, and suffering. This conflict represents broader societal tensions between anthropocentric and animal-centric ethical frameworks. (8 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe debate surrounding xenotransplantation reflects deeper societal divisions about the appropriate use of animals for human benefit. Proponents of xenotransplantation often present utilitarian arguments, noting that the \"anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone\" <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This comparison attempts to contextualize the ethical concerns by suggesting that xenotransplantation represents a relatively minor animal welfare issue when compared to established practices of animal use.\n\nHowever, critics challenge this framing, arguing that this comparison overlooks the full scope of animals affected by xenotransplantation. They emphasize that \"the number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, some animals would be kept for breeding or rejected for failing to meet viability criteria, further expanding the ethical footprint of xenotransplantation practices.\n\nThe fundamental tension in this debate stems from contrasting value frameworks. The approach to xenotransplantation is described by many critics as \"anthropocentric and puts human life above that of other animal species\" <Paper corpusId=\"232385374\" paperTitle=\"(Ryczek et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This perspective prioritizes human medical needs over animal welfare concerns. Historical precedent suggests that \"as we know from the rise of industrial agriculture and the history of animal research, human benefit usually wins\" when these interests conflict <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnimal rights advocates present a fundamentally different moral framework, contending that \"animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants\" <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. They emphasize that \"every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. For these critics, the sentience and cognitive abilities of animals provide a moral basis for limiting their use regardless of potential human benefits.\n\nReligious and cultural perspectives further complicate the ethical landscape. While \"some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life\" <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. For vegetarians and others with animal welfare concerns, xenotransplantation creates a profound \"ethical dilemma regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings\" <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSome critics also point to apparent inconsistencies in xenotransplantation practices. For instance, the \"need to raise a xenograft donor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's\" natural needs and behaviors <Paper corpusId=\"249476391\" paperTitle=\"(Carrier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This raises concerns that ethical compromises regarding animal welfare are being made primarily for human benefit.\n\nOpposition to xenotransplantation also stems from concerns about genetic modification, with \"many animal rights organizations against the use of animals for research, including xenotransplantation\" <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some argue that scientists may disturb the fundamental nature of species, though proponents counter that \"selective breeding has caused more extensive modifications than the ten genetic alterations engineered for xenotransplantation\" <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"253552364\" paperTitle=\"(George, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese conflicting perspectives highlight the need for \"more comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public\" to determine the \"societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization\" <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The ongoing tensions between human medical needs and animal welfare concerns reflect broader societal disagreements about the moral status of animals and the limits of their use for human benefit.",

However, a number of ethical and psychosocial issues exist around xenotransplantation that do not necessarily apply to the use of traditional human allografts.\n\nThere are additionally those who eschew the use of animals and/or animal products as a source of food or dry goods for either religious or animal welfare concerns, and these individuals may take issue with utilization of xenografts as a resource for reducing the transplant wait list (88). There are others still that take issue with raising animals with the exclusive intent of utilizing their organs for xenotransplantation, though the anticipated number of animals needed for this purpose is significantly smaller than the more than 100 million animals killed for food each year in the US alone (82,88).\n\nPigs raised as a source of xenografts would likely require confinement to reduce the risk of infection and subsequent transmission of an infection to the future recipient of the xenograft. Animals raised under such conditions would not be in an environment in which they would be able to freely roam and interact with other animals like some of their farm-raised counterparts (12,88). This leads to a conflict among those with animal welfare concerns because the need to raise a xenograftdonor pig in a sterile environment to protect the recipient is in direct conflict with the pig's"

[12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization.\n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]"

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals' natures. This is a significant concern for society in general."

Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61].\n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]."

                            "Early in 2022 the first pig to human cardiac xenotransplant was performed. The graft initially performed well, and rejection was well controlled. However, the graft failed, and the patient died 60 days after the procedure. The ethical issues relating to xenotransplantation include the risk/benefit to the individual, the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents crossing into humans, animal welfare and rights, issues of human and animal identity and concerns relating to fair allocation of organs and appropriate use of resources. These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician. In this review we will consider the virtues of justice, courage, temperance and practical wisdom, as well as the role of clinical curiosity, and their application to xenotransplantation. This provides an alternative approach for the clinical academic and others involved in the research to reflect on their practice."
