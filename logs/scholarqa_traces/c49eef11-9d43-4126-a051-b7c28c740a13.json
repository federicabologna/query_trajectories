By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.",

                    "text": "On top of the formal imperatives reviewed thus far, a number of best practices contribute to quality manufacturing of biologics. First among these is having the necessary knowledge and experience in the manufacturing workforce. Several thousand professionals with a broad range of skills, training and expertise are required to staff the Janssen supply chain, many of whom have 20 + years of research and manufacturing experience with Remicade. This level of continuity is essential to developing and retaining the historical, institutional and product specific knowledge required in this environment. This knowledge, combined with advances in process and analytical technology and internal innovations, has led to continuous improvements in testing and control of process/raw material variability, enabling the organization to solve challenges which inevitably arise.\n\nAn example of just such a challenge is handling raw material variability. Of concern to industry and authorities alike is the potential impact of shifts in trace metal content in cell culture media components on antibody glycosylation. Years of research have given Janssen an understanding of the highly complex relationship between trace metals and post-translational modifications of the antibody. This understanding, which is specific to the cell line and source materials used, has enabled Janssen to minimize the occurrence of these shifts and limit their impact on the final product. Close partnerships with the suppliers of these media components facilitate proactive quality control and lead to quick resolution in the event of unexpected shifts.\n\nAnother best practice is strategic short-and long-term forecasting of demand to ensure reliability of supply. Each site in the Remicade supply chain network utilizes sophisticated local and global forecasting tools, which enable site manufacturing logistics to plan operations, including transfer of product intermediates between sites to maximize efficiency. Likewise, the need for additional capacity must be identified long in advance, as the construction and regulatory approval of new manufacturing sites can take years. This requires a willingness to invest in costly added capacity before absolute certainty exists that the forecasted growth in market demand will actually materialize.\n\nAbove all else, there can be no shortcuts in product quality and process compliance, and effective management of both is of paramount importance. The magnitude and complexity of the process demand stringent, effective quality systems with appropriate policies and procedures across all phases of manufacturing and distribution. Keeping the facilities and processes up to date with regulatory requirements, technology changes, expanded capacity and global distribution networks is a necessary, ongoing process.",

This time was needed to develop and refine the process, and then validate through repeated production and testing that the final process could yield product consistently. Clinical development followed a parallel path during this time, with progression to later trial phases occurring alongside the maturation of the manufacturing process, as required by regulators.\n\nSeveral steps were necessary for development of the manufacturing process:\n\n\u2022 Meticulous planning and design of the facility, the utility/ engineering systems, the equipment, the critical processing areas, and validation of the same. \u2022 Identification and validation of the conditions under which the cell line and the biologic are best maintained and processed. \u2022 Identification of the parameters which are key to measuring process performance and product quality attributes which are key to safety, efficacy and consistency. \u2022 Definition of the limits (\"specifications\") of acceptable variability for each target parameter/attribute. \u2022 An understanding of how the variability of each parameter/attribute can be measured and controlled. \u2022 A quality control system which ensures that each batch of product meets the specifications set for each parameter/ attribute. \u2022 Strategic supplier relationships which monitor key incoming materials continuously to ensure their quality and consistent supply.\n\nOnce finalized, the manufacturing facility, the process, the identified parameters and their specifications must be approved by regulators as a condition of marketing approval [8] and are then locked into place. Commercial product and product used for subsequent clinical development are sourced from this approved process. Combined with the cell line, the approved manufacturing process and the testing specifications, which are both proprietary to Janssen and largely confidential, can be viewed conceptually as the definition of Remicade.\n\nTo understand further how Janssen controls variability in the manufacturing of Remicade, an overview of the process is helpful. It typically takes 9 months to manufacture each batch, and when combined with the time to acquire and release raw materials, the process can take up to 18 months. The process encompasses seven major phases ( Fig. 1), each consisting of dozens of steps and each of which is a source of potential product variability:\n\n\u2022 Procurement of raw materials and disposables. \u2022 WCB. \u2022 Production cell culture (fermentation). \u2022 Purification and bulk release. \u2022 Vial",

Since then, it has been granted seven additional indications [3], including pediatric Crohn's disease, adult and pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, and has been used to treat over 2.6 million [4] patients in 100 + countries. On any given day, approximately 600,000 patients are receiving or are in between Remicade infusions.\n\nOne contributing factor to the success of Remicade has been Janssen's ability to ensure an uninterrupted, adequate supply. Janssen has produced over 150 million vials of Remicade since 1998 and is currently delivering approximately 14 million vials per year. During this time, Janssen's manufacturing operations have been both expanded and updated [5], while simultaneously continuing to produce drug which meets quality specifications and market demand.\n\nIn this summary, we review the challenges associated with manufacturing large-volume biologics and the measures needed to ensure high-quality, long-term consistency and adequate supply by presentation of the example\n\n## The Challenges to Production and Distribution of a Large-Volume Biologic: Understanding and Controlling Variability\nIn contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.\n\n## A Tightly Controlled Manufacturing Process\nDevelopment of Remicade's manufacturing process began as soon as the cA2 antibody was selected for development in 1992 [7], a full 6 years prior to the first FDA approval. This time was needed to develop and refine the process, and then validate through repeated production and testing that the final process could yield product consistently. Clinical development followed a parallel path during this time, with progression to later trial phases occurring alongside the maturation of the manufacturing process, as required by regulators.\n\nSeveral steps were necessary for development of the manufacturing process:\n\n\u2022 Meticulous planning and design of the facility, the utility/ engineering systems, the equipment, the critical processing areas, and validation of the same. \u2022 Identification and validation of the conditions under which the cell line and the biologic are best maintained and processed. \u2022 Identification of the parameters which are key to measuring process performance and product quality attributes which are key to safety, efficacy and consistency. \u2022 Definition of the limits (\"specifications\") of acceptable variability for each target parameter/attribute. \u2022 An understanding of how the variability of each parameter/attribute can be measured and controlled. \u2022 A quality control system which ensures that each batch of product meets the specifications set for each parameter/ attribute. \u2022 Strategic supplier relationships which monitor key incoming materials continuously to ensure their quality and consistent supply.\n\nOnce finalized, the manufacturing facility, the process, the identified parameters and their specifications must be approved by regulators as a condition of marketing approval [8] and are then locked into place. Commercial product and product used for subsequent clinical development are sourced from this approved process. Combined with the cell line, the approved manufacturing process and the testing specifications, which are both proprietary to Janssen and largely confidential, can be viewed conceptually as the definition of Remicade.\n\nTo understand further how Janssen controls variability in the manufacturing of Remicade, an overview of the process is helpful. It typically takes 9 months to manufacture each batch, and when combined with the time to acquire and release raw materials, the process can take up to 18 months. The process encompasses seven major phases ( Fig. 1), each consisting of dozens of steps and each of which is a source of potential product variability:\n\n\u2022 Procurement of raw materials and disposables. \u2022 WCB. \u2022 Production cell culture (fermentation). \u2022 Purification and bulk release. \u2022 Vial\n\n## Quality Control of Each Phase of Manufacturing\nThe manufacturer is responsible for establishing a rigorous and reliable quality system which ensures strict control over the manufacturing process and product quality attributes, and fully adheres to GMPs specified by regulatory authorities. The entire production process is subject to testing at each step of the way, including quality control of raw materials, monitoring of equipment (operating parameters), the WCB aliquot (e.g., productivity, viability), the antibody (e.g., molecular weight, protein structure) and general product quality (e.g., chemical characteristics, potency, purity, sterility) (Fig. 2). From start to finish, the product and process undergo approximately 250 tests and must pass each before formal product release to the market. This is considerably more than the required testing for small molecule drugs and reflects the complexity of manufacturing biologics [9]. Each test has its own set of specifications designed to ensure identity, potency and safety of the product and to limit variability of each target parameter to within specifications. These specifications are determined during the final stages of development, based on careful process and product characterization, experience with multiple batches, functional testing and clinical evaluation.\n\n## Additional Considerations\nOn top of the formal imperatives reviewed thus far, a number of best practices contribute to quality manufacturing of biologics. First among these is having the necessary knowledge and experience in the manufacturing workforce. Several thousand professionals with a broad range of skills, training and expertise are required to staff the Janssen supply chain, many of whom have 20 + years of research and manufacturing experience with Remicade. This level of continuity is essential to developing and retaining the historical, institutional and product specific knowledge required in this environment. This knowledge, combined with advances in process and analytical technology and internal innovations, has led to continuous improvements in testing and control of process/raw material variability, enabling the organization to solve challenges which inevitably arise.\n\nAn example of just such a challenge is handling raw material variability. Of concern to industry and authorities alike is the potential impact of shifts in trace metal content in cell culture media components on antibody glycosylation. Years of research have given Janssen an understanding of the highly complex relationship between trace metals and post-translational modifications of the antibody. This understanding, which is specific to the cell line and source materials used, has enabled Janssen to minimize the occurrence of these shifts and limit their impact on the final product. Close partnerships with the suppliers of these media components facilitate proactive quality control and lead to quick resolution in the event of unexpected shifts.\n\nAnother best practice is strategic short-and long-term forecasting of demand to ensure reliability of supply. Each site in the Remicade supply chain network utilizes sophisticated local and global forecasting tools, which enable site manufacturing logistics to plan operations, including transfer of product intermediates between sites to maximize efficiency. Likewise, the need for additional capacity must be identified long in advance, as the construction and regulatory approval of new manufacturing sites can take years. This requires a willingness to invest in costly added capacity before absolute certainty exists that the forecasted growth in market demand will actually materialize.\n\nAbove all else, there can be no shortcuts in product quality and process compliance, and effective management of both is of paramount importance. The magnitude and complexity of the process demand stringent, effective quality systems with appropriate policies and procedures across all phases of manufacturing and distribution. Keeping the facilities and processes up to date with regulatory requirements, technology changes, expanded capacity and global distribution networks is a necessary, ongoing process.",

Hence, controlling glycosylation patterns is central to any drug development program, yet poses a formidable challenge to the bio-manufacturing industry. Process changes, which can affect glycosylation patterns, range from manufacturing at different scales or sites, to switching production process mode, all the way to using alternative host cell lines. In the emerging space of biosimilars development, often times all of these aspects apply. Gaining a deep understanding of the direction and extent to which glycosylation quality attributes can be modulated is key for efficient fine-tuning of glycan profiles in a stage appropriate manner, but establishment of such platform knowledge is time consuming and resource intensive. Here we report an inexpensive and highly adaptable screening system for comprehensive modulation of glycans on antibodies expressed in CHO cells. We characterize 10 media additives in univariable studies and in combination, using a design of experiments approach to map the design space for tuning glycosylation profile attributes. We introduce a robust workflow that does not require automation, yet enables rapid process optimization. We demonstrate scalability across deep wells, shake flasks, AMBR-15 cell culture system, and 2 L single-use bioreactors. Further, we show that it is broadly applicable to different molecules and host cell lineages. This universal approach permits fine-tuned modulation of glycan product quality, reduces development costs, and enables agile implementation of process changes throughout the product lifecycle.",

In particular, N-linked glycosylation can profoundly influence biochemical and physiological properties of antibodies. The bio-manufacturing industry has used mammalian expression systems, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or NS0 cells, for the production of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics to recreate human-like posttranslational glycosylation patterns, 1 but the complexities of controlling glycan structures continue to pose substantial challenges, including the selection of an appropriate glycosylation product quality profile suitable for a given pharmaceutical antibody. In particular, maintaining a consistent product quality profile across cell age, between different master or working cell banks, and when producing mAbs in different types of vessels, at different manufacturing sites, or at different scales remains challenging. Such difficulties may occur during process transfers, scale-up or scale-out, or after changes in raw material sourcing, in particular when executing against aggressive timelines, and they underscore the importance of maintaining consistent product quality over the entire product lifecycle. In order to enable agile implementation of process changes at later developmental stages, it is crucial to build a solid understanding of the underlying design space and its limitations. Importantly, such an adaptable platform for glycan product quality modulation should be effectively implemented early in development. Analogous considerations apply for the growing field of biosimilar development, where the product quality of a reference medicinal product must be matched within tight specification limits. \n\nAntibody N-linked glycosylation encompasses a multi-step biochemical process in different compartments of the secretory pathway, resulting in a varied population of predominantly biantennary glycoforms in the final product pool. 1,2 his is particularly important because different glycoforms have been demonstrated to mediate effector functions, influence circulatory half-life, or elicit immunogenicity, all of which can affect drug efficacy or patient safety. 3][14] Therefore, the product quality profile should be defined and maintained early on.",

Clark, Kristina Ladd, Stefani Takahashi, Anna Brousseau, Seth Kitchener, Robert Herbst, T. Ryll\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT The extent and pattern of glycosylation on therapeutic antibodies can influence their circulatory half-life, engagement of effector functions, and immunogenicity, with direct consequences to efficacy and patient safety. Hence, controlling glycosylation patterns is central to any drug development program, yet poses a formidable challenge to the bio-manufacturing industry. Process changes, which can affect glycosylation patterns, range from manufacturing at different scales or sites, to switching production process mode, all the way to using alternative host cell lines. In the emerging space of biosimilars development, often times all of these aspects apply. Gaining a deep understanding of the direction and extent to which glycosylation quality attributes can be modulated is key for efficient fine-tuning of glycan profiles in a stage appropriate manner, but establishment of such platform knowledge is time consuming and resource intensive. Here we report an inexpensive and highly adaptable screening system for comprehensive modulation of glycans on antibodies expressed in CHO cells. We characterize 10 media additives in univariable studies and in combination, using a design of experiments approach to map the design space for tuning glycosylation profile attributes. We introduce a robust workflow that does not require automation, yet enables rapid process optimization. We demonstrate scalability across deep wells, shake flasks, AMBR-15 cell culture system, and 2 L single-use bioreactors. Further, we show that it is broadly applicable to different molecules and host cell lineages. This universal approach permits fine-tuned modulation of glycan product quality, reduces development costs, and enables agile implementation of process changes throughout the product lifecycle.\n## Introduction\nPosttranslational modification is a central mechanism for the regulation of mammalian protein function. In particular, N-linked glycosylation can profoundly influence biochemical and physiological properties of antibodies. The bio-manufacturing industry has used mammalian expression systems, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or NS0 cells, for the production of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics to recreate human-like posttranslational glycosylation patterns, 1 but the complexities of controlling glycan structures continue to pose substantial challenges, including the selection of an appropriate glycosylation product quality profile suitable for a given pharmaceutical antibody. In particular, maintaining a consistent product quality profile across cell age, between different master or working cell banks, and when producing mAbs in different types of vessels, at different manufacturing sites, or at different scales remains challenging. Such difficulties may occur during process transfers, scale-up or scale-out, or after changes in raw material sourcing, in particular when executing against aggressive timelines, and they underscore the importance of maintaining consistent product quality over the entire product lifecycle. In order to enable agile implementation of process changes at later developmental stages, it is crucial to build a solid understanding of the underlying design space and its limitations. Importantly, such an adaptable platform for glycan product quality modulation should be effectively implemented early in development. Analogous considerations apply for the growing field of biosimilar development, where the product quality of a reference medicinal product must be matched within tight specification limits. \n\nAntibody N-linked glycosylation encompasses a multi-step biochemical process in different compartments of the secretory pathway, resulting in a varied population of predominantly biantennary glycoforms in the final product pool. 1,2 his is particularly important because different glycoforms have been demonstrated to mediate effector functions, influence circulatory half-life, or elicit immunogenicity, all of which can affect drug efficacy or patient safety. 3][14] Therefore, the product quality profile should be defined and maintained early on.",

A range of biotherapeutics are currently synthesized using cell culture methods in large scale manufacturing facilities that produce products for both commercial use and clinical studies. The robust implementation of this technology requires optimization of a number of variables, including 1) cell lines capable of synthesizing the required molecules at high productivities that ensure low operating cost; 2) culture media and bioreactor culture conditions that achieve both the requisite productivity and meet product quality specifications; 3) appropriate on-line and off-line sensors capable of providing information that enhances process knowledge; and 4) good understanding of culture performance at different scales to ensure smooth scale-up. Successful implementation also requires appropriate strategies for process development, scale-up and process characterization and validation that enable robust operation that is compliant with current regulations. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the art technology in key aspects of cell culture, e.g., engineering of highly productive cell lines and optimization of cell culture process conditions. We also summarize the current thinking on appropriate process development strategies and process advances that might affect process development.",

Process characterization and validation usually occurs after the completion of Phase 3 process development, when the manufacturing process is locked and no further significant changes are expected. Although much process characterization and validation work can be performed using qualified scale-down models, full-scale process validation is required to demonstrate consistent process performance and product quality when controlling critical process parameters within pre-defined acceptable ranges at commercial scale. For validation purposes, three and five consecutive full-scale runs are normally required for BLA approval in the US and EU, respectively. \n\nThe objectives of process characterization include identification of critical operational parameters and key performance indicators, establishment of acceptable ranges for operational parameters, and demonstration of process robustness. 2,79,80 echnical information from the characterization studies has also become a regulatory expectation in recent years as a prerequisite for manufacturing process validation, as well as for long-term commercial manufacturing support. 77,78 Since performing a characterization study at the manufacturing scale is not practically feasible due to the cost of operation and limited availability of large-scale bioreactors, scale-down models that represent the performance of manufacturing scale process are usually employed. \n\nIt is also important to use qualified analytical methods and raw materials throughout the characterization studies for consistency and accuracy. Cell culture process characterization requires support from the purification and analytical groups to test process impact and monitor product quality. Some cell culture materials from characterization studies can be used as feed stream for downstream process characterization, especially for robustness studies, e.g., linkage between upstream and downstream unit operation performance.",

For antibody manufacturing process development, maintaining desired quality attributes while reducing time to market, maintaining cost effectiveness, and providing manufacturing flexibility are key issues in today's competitive market, where several companies are often working on therapies for similar targets and clinical indications. Since antibody therapies may require large doses over a long period of time, manufacturing capacity becomes an issue because the drug substance must be produced in large quantities with cost and time efficiency to meet clinical requirements and pave the way toward commercialization. In response to the strong demand, many companies have built large scale manufacturing plants containing multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors. \n\nIn terms of manufacturability and scalability, mammalian cells have historically been considered difficult to work with due to factors such as low yield, medium complexity, serum requirement, and shear sensitivity, although the latter has generally been incorrectly overemphasized. After two decades of intensive development work in cell line, media and bioreactor condition optimization, cell specific productivity of over 20 pg/cell/day can be routinely achieved for production cell lines; 1 high titers up to \u223c10 g/L and cell densities of over 20 million cells/mL in fed-batch processes have been recently reported by a few companies at major conferences. The enhancement of specific productivity per cell is achieved not only by selection of highly productive clones, but also by optimization of medium composition and bioreactor operation conditions. Today, the combination of high titers and large capacity has gradually shifted the focus of cell culture process development from pursing even higher titers to controlling product quality and process consistency at all development stages and production scales. 3 ell culture process development starts with cell line generation and selection, followed by process and media optimization in small scale systems, including 96-well plates, shaker flasks, and bench-scale bioreactors, for high throughput screening purposes.",

Amanullah\n## Abstract\nAnimal cell culture technology has advanced significantly over the last few decades and is now generally considered a reliable, robust and relatively mature technology. A range of biotherapeutics are currently synthesized using cell culture methods in large scale manufacturing facilities that produce products for both commercial use and clinical studies. The robust implementation of this technology requires optimization of a number of variables, including 1) cell lines capable of synthesizing the required molecules at high productivities that ensure low operating cost; 2) culture media and bioreactor culture conditions that achieve both the requisite productivity and meet product quality specifications; 3) appropriate on-line and off-line sensors capable of providing information that enhances process knowledge; and 4) good understanding of culture performance at different scales to ensure smooth scale-up. Successful implementation also requires appropriate strategies for process development, scale-up and process characterization and validation that enable robust operation that is compliant with current regulations. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the art technology in key aspects of cell culture, e.g., engineering of highly productive cell lines and optimization of cell culture process conditions. We also summarize the current thinking on appropriate process development strategies and process advances that might affect process development.\n## Introduction\nWith the increasing number of protein therapeutic candidates, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) entering various stages of development, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking at innovative solutions to deliver this pipeline. For antibody manufacturing process development, maintaining desired quality attributes while reducing time to market, maintaining cost effectiveness, and providing manufacturing flexibility are key issues in today's competitive market, where several companies are often working on therapies for similar targets and clinical indications. Since antibody therapies may require large doses over a long period of time, manufacturing capacity becomes an issue because the drug substance must be produced in large quantities with cost and time efficiency to meet clinical requirements and pave the way toward commercialization. In response to the strong demand, many companies have built large scale manufacturing plants containing multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors. \n\nIn terms of manufacturability and scalability, mammalian cells have historically been considered difficult to work with due to factors such as low yield, medium complexity, serum requirement, and shear sensitivity, although the latter has generally been incorrectly overemphasized. After two decades of intensive development work in cell line, media and bioreactor condition optimization, cell specific productivity of over 20 pg/cell/day can be routinely achieved for production cell lines; 1 high titers up to \u223c10 g/L and cell densities of over 20 million cells/mL in fed-batch processes have been recently reported by a few companies at major conferences. The enhancement of specific productivity per cell is achieved not only by selection of highly productive clones, but also by optimization of medium composition and bioreactor operation conditions. Today, the combination of high titers and large capacity has gradually shifted the focus of cell culture process development from pursing even higher titers to controlling product quality and process consistency at all development stages and production scales. 3 ell culture process development starts with cell line generation and selection, followed by process and media optimization in small scale systems, including 96-well plates, shaker flasks, and bench-scale bioreactors, for high throughput screening purposes.\n\n## Medium and Feeding Strategy Development\nSince the effect of process parameters on key performance indicators and quality attributes may vary for different cell culture steps, each operation may need to be characterized and validated separately. Process characterization and validation usually occurs after the completion of Phase 3 process development, when the manufacturing process is locked and no further significant changes are expected. Although much process characterization and validation work can be performed using qualified scale-down models, full-scale process validation is required to demonstrate consistent process performance and product quality when controlling critical process parameters within pre-defined acceptable ranges at commercial scale. For validation purposes, three and five consecutive full-scale runs are normally required for BLA approval in the US and EU, respectively. \n\nThe objectives of process characterization include identification of critical operational parameters and key performance indicators, establishment of acceptable ranges for operational parameters, and demonstration of process robustness. 2,79,80 echnical information from the characterization studies has also become a regulatory expectation in recent years as a prerequisite for manufacturing process validation, as well as for long-term commercial manufacturing support. 77,78 Since performing a characterization study at the manufacturing scale is not practically feasible due to the cost of operation and limited availability of large-scale bioreactors, scale-down models that represent the performance of manufacturing scale process are usually employed. \n\nIt is also important to use qualified analytical methods and raw materials throughout the characterization studies for consistency and accuracy. Cell culture process characterization requires support from the purification and analytical groups to test process impact and monitor product quality. Some cell culture materials from characterization studies can be used as feed stream for downstream process characterization, especially for robustness studies, e.g., linkage between upstream and downstream unit operation performance.",

Even minor deviations in critical process parameters (CPPs) such as media and feed compositions can significantly affect product critical quality attributes (CQAs). To identify CPPs and their interdependencies with product yield and CQAs, design of experiments, and multivariate statistical approaches are typically used in industry. Although these models can predict the effect of CPPs on product yield, there is room to improve CQA prediction performance by capturing the complex relationships in high-dimensional data. In this regard, machine learning (ML) approaches offer immense potential in handling non-linear datasets and thus are able to identify new CPPs that could effectively predict the CQAs. ML techniques can also be synergized with mechanistic models as a \u2018hybrid ML\u2019 or \u2018white box ML\u2019 to identify how CPPs affect the product yield and quality mechanistically, thus enabling rational design and control of the bioprocess. In this review, we describe the role of statistical modeling in Quality by Design (QbD) for biomanufacturing, and provide a generic outline on how relevant ML can be used to meaningfully analyze bioprocessing datasets. We then offer our perspectives on how relevant use of ML can accelerate the implementation of systematic QbD within the biopharma 4.0 paradigm.",

[3][4][5][6] The biopharmaceutical product quality is also extremely sensitive to changes in the underlying biomanufacturing operating conditions and raw materials. Even a minor variation in bioreactor physicochemical conditions such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (dO 2 ) and cell culture media can lead to significant alterations in different product quality attributes. For example, cell culture pH has been shown to greatly affect multiple quality attributes of the mAbs, including N-glycosylation, 7-10 aggregation, 10,11 and charge variations. 10,12 Therefore, biomanufacturing is highly regulated to ensure the safety and efficacy of biologic products.\n\nIn traditional biomanufacturing, product quality in biopharmaceuticals is evaluated using a quality by testing approach. 13 However, significantly higher wastage (more than 50% in some cases) and the subsequent inability to understand the root cause of inefficient bioprocesses have prompted drug regulators such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) to recommend the adoption of the Quality by Design (QbD) approach. 14 QbD approaches rely on the comprehensive understanding of the product and the associated manufacturing processes where the CQAs of the product and its yield would be viewed as a function of various critical process parameters (CPPs). Bioprocesses are now routinely designed following the QbD paradigm, 15 whereby the CPPs that affect the product yield and CQAs are first identified and the manufacturing process is regulated and monitored accordingly.

Ho, S. Ng, Meiyappan Lakshmanan\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Ensuring consistent high yields and product quality are key challenges in biomanufacturing. Even minor deviations in critical process parameters (CPPs) such as media and feed compositions can significantly affect product critical quality attributes (CQAs). To identify CPPs and their interdependencies with product yield and CQAs, design of experiments, and multivariate statistical approaches are typically used in industry. Although these models can predict the effect of CPPs on product yield, there is room to improve CQA prediction performance by capturing the complex relationships in high-dimensional data. In this regard, machine learning (ML) approaches offer immense potential in handling non-linear datasets and thus are able to identify new CPPs that could effectively predict the CQAs. ML techniques can also be synergized with mechanistic models as a \u2018hybrid ML\u2019 or \u2018white box ML\u2019 to identify how CPPs affect the product yield and quality mechanistically, thus enabling rational design and control of the bioprocess. In this review, we describe the role of statistical modeling in Quality by Design (QbD) for biomanufacturing, and provide a generic outline on how relevant ML can be used to meaningfully analyze bioprocessing datasets. We then offer our perspectives on how relevant use of ML can accelerate the implementation of systematic QbD within the biopharma 4.0 paradigm.\n## Introduction\nBiopharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fusion proteins are currently the most lucrative drugs in the market: 7 of the top 10 drugs in 2019 are biopharmaceuticals. 1 Unlike small molecules, biopharmaceuticals are large, complex drugs that are typically produced using live mammalian cells. 2 The biological activity of biopharmaceuticals is extremely sensitive to variations in their critical quality attributes (CQAs), such as the N-glycosylation, charge distribution and aggregation. [3][4][5][6] The biopharmaceutical product quality is also extremely sensitive to changes in the underlying biomanufacturing operating conditions and raw materials. Even a minor variation in bioreactor physicochemical conditions such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (dO 2 ) and cell culture media can lead to significant alterations in different product quality attributes. For example, cell culture pH has been shown to greatly affect multiple quality attributes of the mAbs, including N-glycosylation, 7-10 aggregation, 10,11 and charge variations. 10,12 Therefore, biomanufacturing is highly regulated to ensure the safety and efficacy of biologic products.\n\nIn traditional biomanufacturing, product quality in biopharmaceuticals is evaluated using a quality by testing approach. 13 However, significantly higher wastage (more than 50% in some cases) and the subsequent inability to understand the root cause of inefficient bioprocesses have prompted drug regulators such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) to recommend the adoption of the Quality by Design (QbD) approach. 14 QbD approaches rely on the comprehensive understanding of the product and the associated manufacturing processes where the CQAs of the product and its yield would be viewed as a function of various critical process parameters (CPPs). Bioprocesses are now routinely designed following the QbD paradigm, 15 whereby the CPPs that affect the product yield and CQAs are first identified and the manufacturing process is regulated and monitored accordingly. In QbD, design of experiments (DoE) is first used to conduct experiments in a structured manner with variations in CPPs such as pH, temperature,",

            "abstract": "The continuous manufacturing of biologics offers significant advantages in terms of reducing manufacturing costs and increasing capacity, but it is not yet widely implemented by the industry due to major challenges in the automation, scheduling, process monitoring, continued process verification, and real-time control of multiple interconnected processing steps, which must be tightly controlled to produce a safe and efficacious product. The process produces a large amount of data from different sensors, analytical instruments, and offline analyses, requiring organization, storage, and analyses for process monitoring and control without compromising accuracy. We present a case study of a cyber\u2013physical production system (CPPS) for the continuous manufacturing of mAbs that provides an automation infrastructure for data collection and storage in a data historian, along with data management tools that enable real-time analysis of the ongoing process using multivariate algorithms. The CPPS also facilitates process control and provides support in handling deviations at the process level by allowing the continuous train to re-adjust itself via a series of interconnected surge tanks and by recommending corrective actions to the operator. Successful steady-state operation is demonstrated for 55 h with end-to-end process automation and data collection via a range of in-line and at-line sensors. Following this, a series of deviations in the downstream unit operations, including affinity capture chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and ultrafiltration, are monitored and tracked using multivariate approaches and in-process controls. The system is in line with Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing concepts and is the first end-to-end CPPS for the continuous manufacturing of mAbs.",

Nikita, Vinesh B. Yezhuvath, V. S. Buddhiraju, Anurag S. Rathore\n## Abstract\nThe continuous manufacturing of biologics offers significant advantages in terms of reducing manufacturing costs and increasing capacity, but it is not yet widely implemented by the industry due to major challenges in the automation, scheduling, process monitoring, continued process verification, and real-time control of multiple interconnected processing steps, which must be tightly controlled to produce a safe and efficacious product. The process produces a large amount of data from different sensors, analytical instruments, and offline analyses, requiring organization, storage, and analyses for process monitoring and control without compromising accuracy. We present a case study of a cyber\u2013physical production system (CPPS) for the continuous manufacturing of mAbs that provides an automation infrastructure for data collection and storage in a data historian, along with data management tools that enable real-time analysis of the ongoing process using multivariate algorithms. The CPPS also facilitates process control and provides support in handling deviations at the process level by allowing the continuous train to re-adjust itself via a series of interconnected surge tanks and by recommending corrective actions to the operator. Successful steady-state operation is demonstrated for 55 h with end-to-end process automation and data collection via a range of in-line and at-line sensors. Following this, a series of deviations in the downstream unit operations, including affinity capture chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and ultrafiltration, are monitored and tracked using multivariate approaches and in-process controls. The system is in line with Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing concepts and is the first end-to-end CPPS for the continuous manufacturing of mAbs.\n## Introduction\nCPPSs provide an effective tool for overcoming these automation and control challenges and developing reliable and robust frameworks for continuous processing [7,8].In this work, we showcase the development of a CPPS system for the continuous manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are currently the largest class of biotherapeutics and have a well-established manufacturing process platform that is suitable for adapting into a continuous processing platform.There are three major elements of CPPSs, i.e., \"connectedness\", \"intelligence\", and \"responsiveness\", and all these elements work together to execute, monitor, and control an end-to-end continuous process [4,5].Integrating the system with digital twins can be an added advantage.The adoption of digital solutions has further enabled the implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts [6].\n\nCPPSs can also be a powerful enabler of continued process verification (CPV), which is an approach followed by biopharmaceutical companies to continuously monitor and validate manufacturing plants and processes, with the aim of ensuring consistent product quality [9].CPV leverages knowledge of the relationships between critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) [10].CPV continues to evolve as more data are generated and can be leveraged as the framework for data collection, cleaning, storage, and retrieval, with functionality to take into account the diverse types and frequencies of data acquired during the operation process from various in-line, at-line, or off-line sensors.Though well-established for batch-mode manufacturing, CPV approaches specific to the continuous manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals have thus far gained minimal attention [11,12].In 2014, a consortium of biopharmaceutical companies published a case study on CPV for mAb manufacturing processes [13].However, the recommendations in the plan were for batch-style manufacturing with individual unconnected unit operations.In 2019 and 2021, the US FDA published two draft guidance documents emphasizing continuous manufacturing [14,15].There is a need for case studies showcasing the use of CPPSs for continuous processes that can enable process monitoring at the level required for CPV.\n\n## Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies is challenging due to the large number of complex unit operations that need to be undertaken.Biopharma products and processes are characterized by the presence of large number of CQAs and CPPs, respectively.All of these need to be monitored and controlled in order to produce a safe and efficacious mAb product.This complexity is a major impediment to the successful adoption of continuous processing in biopharma manufacturing, despite the significant advantages it offers in terms of process economics and manufacturing capacity.Major challenges in automation, process scheduling, process monitoring, and real-time process correction need to be overcome.Furthermore, CPV requires sophisticated systems for the storage, retrieval, and real-time analysis of data that can handle all the heterogenous sources of data from the process equipment, analytical instruments, in-line sensors, and operator actions, all of which need to be organized and converted from various file formats and locations (such as tabular files, images, spectra, distributed file systems, and run logs).Carrying out all these activities manually, including data logging, organization, monitoring, statistical analysis, process supervision, and real-time control, is not feasible over long continuous campaigns without introducing multiple errors.\n\nThe case study presented in this work is the first end-to-end CPPS for the continuous manufacturing of mAbs.The proposed automated system has been successfully demonstrated to handle process integration, automation, data collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, monitoring, and control, automatically carrying out all these tasks to maintain the process at a steady state, bringing in operators only when corrective measures are required due to unexpected process breakdown.The CPPS includes the functionality of data acquisition followed by real-time data analysis, process monitoring, process supervision and real-time control actions.The system is in line with Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing concepts and enables plug-and-play modules with different unit operations to be linked together via a system of surge tanks and integrated with a control system, virtual data analytics, and visualization tools, as well as the integration of real-time data acquisition with historical data to enable monitoring and control.",

The analysis addresses critical challenges in current manufacturing processes while evaluating innovative solutions to improve production efficiency and economic viability. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of recent literature on mAb manufacturing, examining traditional batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems. The review evaluates cost optimization strategies, including media development and process integration, while assessing the impact of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, on manufacturing efficiency. Results Recent studies demonstrate that continuous processing can achieve up to 35% cost savings compared to traditional batch processing to meet an annual production demand of 100\u2013500 kg, though this gain diminishes at larger scales. Hybrid facilities show accelerated break-even points, reaching profitability 2\u20132.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. Advanced media optimization strategies, incorporating novel tripeptide delivery methods, have demonstrated up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Integration of machine learning and advanced analytics has significantly enhanced process control and optimization capabilities. Conclusion The evolution of mAb manufacturing technologies offers promising pathways for improving production efficiency and reducing costs. Scale-dependent considerations remain crucial in selecting optimal manufacturing strategies, while emerging technologies present new opportunities for process optimization. Future developments in continuous processing, advanced analytics, and cell line engineering will be essential in meeting growing global demand while ensuring economic viability and accessibility of mAb therapeutics.",

                    "text": "The landscape of mAb manufacturing is rapidly evolving with the integration of advanced technologies and novel approaches. Recent developments in machine learning, advanced analytics, and production platforms are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes, offering unprecedented opportunities for optimization and efficiency improvements. \n\nMachine learning applications have emerged as powerful tools in mAb manufacturing. 25,26 Machine learning approaches for protein expression optimization have shown particular promise as highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan and others. 27,28 Their research demonstrates that deep learning models can accurately predict protein expression levels directly from nucleotide sequences, enabling more efficient sequence optimization for improved yields. Process optimization through machine learning has enabled real-time adjustment of critical process parameters, whereas advanced monitoring systems utilize artificial intelligence to detect and respond to process deviations more rapidly than traditional methods. 29,30 rtificial neural networks (ANNs) have been effectively used in upstream processing to estimate the solubility of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli fed-batch cultivations and product titer. To estimate cell biomass and protein concentration with an accuracy of \u00b14% and \u00b112%, respectively, one prominent example used a radial basis function ANN with partial least squares regression and multiwavelength fluorescence data. 31 n ANN-mechanistic hybrid model was applied for root cause analysis of process deviations in ion exchange chromatography, thereby enabling real-time monitoring by ascertaining the reason and extent of deviations in milliseconds. 32 Using feed stream parameters to estimate suitable filter sizing, another application used ANNs to predict depth filter loading capacity for clarity of monoclonal antibodies in commercial manufacture. 33 merging artificial intelligence method reinforcement learning has shown promise in control optimization, such as in a liquid-liquid extraction process where it attained 32% higher recovery and 23% smaller operational deviations compared to conventional controls. 34 Three times faster than traditional trial-and-error approaches, reinforcement learning was also applied to maximize parameters in cation-exchange chromatography. 35 dvanced analytics have become increasingly crucial in modern mAb manufacturing, with PAT leading the way in real-time process monitoring and control. 36 This technology enables continuous assessment of critical quality attributes, allowing for immediate process adjustments to maintain optimal conditions. QbD principles have been integrated with advanced analytics to create robust manufacturing processes that ensure consistent product quality.",

                    "text": "2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11",

Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11\n\n## Manufacturing Approaches and Process Design in mAb Production\nThe manufacturing of mAbs has evolved significantly over recent decades, with various approaches emerging to address production challenges and economic constraints. This section examines three primary manufacturing strategies, namely,  batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems, analyzing their relative merits and limitations in modern biopharmaceutical production. Batch processing remains the traditional backbone of mAb manufacturing, characterized by discrete production cycles where a single batch is processed from start to finish before initiating the next batch. This approach offers several advantages, including well-established regulatory compliance pathways and simplified process validation. However, batch processing faces limitations in terms of equipment utilization, facility footprint requirements, and operational efficiency. Cost considerations for batch processing are particularly significant, with studies indicating higher capital investment requirements and potentially lower volumetric productivity than in alternative approaches. 8 ontinuous processing has emerged as a promising alternative, offering significant advantages through end-to-end bioprocessing. Recent research demonstrates that single-use continuous facilities can achieve approximately 35% cost savings compared to traditional stainless steel batch facilities in meeting the annual production demand of 100-500 kg. 8 These economic benefits are particularly pronounced at specific production scales and diminish to approximately \u00b110% at higher production volumes (1-3 tons) due to the requirement for multiple parallel continuous trains. Implementation challenges include the requirement of robust process control strategies, real-time monitoring capabilities, and addressing concerns about system stability over extended production runs. 16 ybrid systems represent a middle-ground approach, combining disposable and stainless steel equipment to leverage the advantages of both technologies. Studies have shown that hybrid facilities can achieve faster break-even points, typically 2-2.5 years earlier than the traditional stainless steel facilities. 17 The flexibility benefits of hybrid systems are particularly noteworthy, allowing manufacturers to optimize their process based on scale, product requirements, and economic considerations. Cost analysis reveals that a 3\u00d72000 L bioreactor configuration with pooled harvesting often proves most cost-effective in hybrid setups among all the setups. A comparative analysis of key performance metrics across these manufacturing approaches is presented in Table 2. \n\nGrowing use of continuous processing for monoclonal antibody manufacture clearly marks a paradigm change in manufacturing techniques. David et al 18 conducted a thorough side-by-side comparability research where continuous downstream processing showed equivalent product quality attributes to conventional batch processing with notable benefits.\n\n## Emerging Technologies and Future Directions in mAb Manufacturing\nThe landscape of mAb manufacturing is rapidly evolving with the integration of advanced technologies and novel approaches. Recent developments in machine learning, advanced analytics, and production platforms are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes, offering unprecedented opportunities for optimization and efficiency improvements. \n\nMachine learning applications have emerged as powerful tools in mAb manufacturing. 25,26 Machine learning approaches for protein expression optimization have shown particular promise as highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan and others. 27,28 Their research demonstrates that deep learning models can accurately predict protein expression levels directly from nucleotide sequences, enabling more efficient sequence optimization for improved yields. Process optimization through machine learning has enabled real-time adjustment of critical process parameters, whereas advanced monitoring systems utilize artificial intelligence to detect and respond to process deviations more rapidly than traditional methods. 29,30 rtificial neural networks (ANNs) have been effectively used in upstream processing to estimate the solubility of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli fed-batch cultivations and product titer. To estimate cell biomass and protein concentration with an accuracy of \u00b14% and \u00b112%, respectively, one prominent example used a radial basis function ANN with partial least squares regression and multiwavelength fluorescence data. 31 n ANN-mechanistic hybrid model was applied for root cause analysis of process deviations in ion exchange chromatography, thereby enabling real-time monitoring by ascertaining the reason and extent of deviations in milliseconds. 32 Using feed stream parameters to estimate suitable filter sizing, another application used ANNs to predict depth filter loading capacity for clarity of monoclonal antibodies in commercial manufacture. 33 merging artificial intelligence method reinforcement learning has shown promise in control optimization, such as in a liquid-liquid extraction process where it attained 32% higher recovery and 23% smaller operational deviations compared to conventional controls. 34 Three times faster than traditional trial-and-error approaches, reinforcement learning was also applied to maximize parameters in cation-exchange chromatography. 35 dvanced analytics have become increasingly crucial in modern mAb manufacturing, with PAT leading the way in real-time process monitoring and control. 36 This technology enables continuous assessment of critical quality attributes, allowing for immediate process adjustments to maintain optimal conditions. QbD principles have been integrated with advanced analytics to create robust manufacturing processes that ensure consistent product quality.",

A set of scientific goals includes defining the best molecule or biologic construct for the task at hand, and proving the case for its development. The second set of goals addresses regulatory requirements necessary to introduce the agent into human subjects. In the case of \u201csmall molecule\u201d drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward. In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges. The nature of the \u201cdrug\u201d may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination. Its properties may vary depending on the scale and method of its preparation, purification, and storage. How to test adequately for its safety prior to first introduction in humans may not be straightforward owing to intrinsic differences in response to the agent expected in humans as compared to animals.",

These approaches are guided by the early development of reliable analytical techniques appropriate to the product and to the manufacturing approach. For example, purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies for cGMP manufacture typically involve large-scale chromatography based on multiple isolation principles (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size, and so on). Specific contaminants, such as DNA, endotoxin, viruses from mammalian cell production systems, contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, and the like must be quantified and may require additional specific purification measures to remove or inactivate them. \n\nProblems in refolding or solubility, tendencies to aggregate, and product stability at intermediate holding points can be significant issues in process development for scale-up. These represent key challenges in scale-up from investigator laboratory-generated lots to a potentially suitable scale to allow clinical testing. Additional concerns include subtle degradations of proteins that can lead to undesirable immunogenicity. A major concern is the impact of each additional step on the downstream product, which should be reassessed using in vitro potency assays as well as physicochemical characterization. At major development milestones, selected in vivo models should be reexamined using purified product. \n\nProduction cells must be cGMP qualified and tested for adventitious agents and other contaminants, before initiation of production as well as at end of production. A number of cGMP-qualified cell lines and starting vectors are available commercially at relatively low cost and should be considered for use as raw materials to initiate cGMP seed banks in preference to shared materials of uncertain provenance despite the good intentions of the original provider. In the handling of cell lines, care should also be taken to avoid contamination (e.g., from media components, trypsin, or activities taking place in nearby laboratory space). Postproduction cells can be tested for specific contaminants in the presence of a viral product (e.g., using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).",

Tomaszewski, Sheryl Ruppel, S. Creekmore, E. Sausville\n## Abstract\nPreclinical therapeutics development research is directed toward fulfilling two overlapping sets of goals. A set of scientific goals includes defining the best molecule or biologic construct for the task at hand, and proving the case for its development. The second set of goals addresses regulatory requirements necessary to introduce the agent into human subjects. In the case of \u201csmall molecule\u201d drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward. In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges. The nature of the \u201cdrug\u201d may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination. Its properties may vary depending on the scale and method of its preparation, purification, and storage. How to test adequately for its safety prior to first introduction in humans may not be straightforward owing to intrinsic differences in response to the agent expected in humans as compared to animals.\n## Purity\nPurification strategies depend on the nature of the biologic agent and expected impurities. These approaches are guided by the early development of reliable analytical techniques appropriate to the product and to the manufacturing approach. For example, purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies for cGMP manufacture typically involve large-scale chromatography based on multiple isolation principles (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size, and so on). Specific contaminants, such as DNA, endotoxin, viruses from mammalian cell production systems, contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, and the like must be quantified and may require additional specific purification measures to remove or inactivate them. \n\nProblems in refolding or solubility, tendencies to aggregate, and product stability at intermediate holding points can be significant issues in process development for scale-up. These represent key challenges in scale-up from investigator laboratory-generated lots to a potentially suitable scale to allow clinical testing. Additional concerns include subtle degradations of proteins that can lead to undesirable immunogenicity. A major concern is the impact of each additional step on the downstream product, which should be reassessed using in vitro potency assays as well as physicochemical characterization. At major development milestones, selected in vivo models should be reexamined using purified product. \n\nProduction cells must be cGMP qualified and tested for adventitious agents and other contaminants, before initiation of production as well as at end of production. A number of cGMP-qualified cell lines and starting vectors are available commercially at relatively low cost and should be considered for use as raw materials to initiate cGMP seed banks in preference to shared materials of uncertain provenance despite the good intentions of the original provider. In the handling of cell lines, care should also be taken to avoid contamination (e.g., from media components, trypsin, or activities taking place in nearby laboratory space). Postproduction cells can be tested for specific contaminants in the presence of a viral product (e.g., using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).",

Timely investment in the development and implementation of continuous biomanufacturing can increase the production of consistent-quality drugs at a lower cost and a faster pace, to meet growing demand. Efficient use of equipment, manufacturing footprint, and labor also offer the potential to improve drug accessibility. Although technological efforts enabling continuous biomanufacturing have commenced, challenges remain in the integration, monitoring, and control of traditionally segmented unit operations.

Process parameters monitored in real time may be fed to models, empirical or otherwise, to predict key CQAs such as the glycosylation pattern [145][146][147] during the cell culture process. For example, glycosylation may be modulated through parameters such as amino acids, 148 manganese, 23,149 ammonia, [150][151][152] glycosylation precursors, 153,154 and other additives 146,155 in the cell culture media. Control strategies implemented in cell culture include the use of dielectric spectroscopy 156 and focused-beam reflectance 157 probes for viable cell-density measurement. In purification, many use UV-based control strategies for loading onto continuous chromatography set-ups. 60,158,159 Recently, a NIR flow cell has been integrated with a continuous SMB system for monitoring and control of mAb loading for product capture. 160 xtension of process monitoring and control across the entire manufacturing train is critical to ensure successful continuous operation. For complete process integration, global control strategies should be implemented to assess the impact of upstream process conditions on downstream productivity, requiring elimination of the dichotomy between upstream and downstream processes. For example, upstream processes are currently optimized for higher titer and product quality, while downstream processes consider the removal of lumped measures of aggregates, charge variants and host-cell proteins. Changes in purification processes can alter the content and profile of impurities and product variants, making it desirable to control their generation early in the process. For example, media components 161 and harvest operations 162 have been found to influence the heterogeneities in the impurity 163 and product profiles. 164 Furthermore, inline monitoring of mAb aggregation in cell culture were demonstrated 165,166 to provide relief to purification efforts and improve process yield. Understanding the effect of operational parameters on the final product quality can be leveraged in controlling the process and meeting a target requirement, for example in the case of biosimilars. 12",

Process parameters monitored in real time may be fed to models, empirical or otherwise, to predict key CQAs such as the glycosylation pattern [145][146][147] during the cell culture process. For example, glycosylation may be modulated through parameters such as amino acids, 148 manganese, 23,149 ammonia, [150][151][152] glycosylation precursors, 153,154 and other additives 146,155 in the cell culture media.

In purification, many use UV-based control strategies for loading onto continuous chromatography set-ups. 60,158,159 Recently, a NIR flow cell has been integrated with a continuous SMB system for monitoring and control of mAb loading for product capture. 160 xtension of process monitoring and control across the entire manufacturing train is critical to ensure successful continuous operation. For complete process integration, global control strategies should be implemented to assess the impact of upstream process conditions on downstream productivity, requiring elimination of the dichotomy between upstream and downstream processes. For example, upstream processes are currently optimized for higher titer and product quality, while downstream processes consider the removal of lumped measures of aggregates, charge variants and host-cell proteins. Changes in purification processes can alter the content and profile of impurities and product variants, making it desirable to control their generation early in the process. For example, media components 161 and harvest operations 162 have been found to influence the heterogeneities in the impurity 163 and product profiles. 164 Furthermore, inline monitoring of mAb aggregation in cell culture were demonstrated 165,166 to provide relief to purification efforts and improve process yield. Understanding the effect of operational parameters on the final product quality can be leveraged in controlling the process and meeting a target requirement, for example in the case of biosimilars. 12",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent progress in mammalian cell culture process has resulted in significantly increased product titers, but also a substantial increase in process- and product-related impurities. Due to the diverse physicochemical properties of these impurities, there is constant need for new technologies that offer higher productivity and improved economics without sacrificing the process robustness required to meet final drug substance specifications. Here, we examined the use of new synthetic adsorptive hybrid filters (AHF) modified with the high binding capacity of quaternary amine (Emphaze\u2122 AEX) and salt-tolerant biomimetic (Emphaze\u2122 ST-AEX) ligands for clearance of process-related impurities like host cell protein (HCP), residual DNA, and virus. The potential to remove soluble aggregates was also examined. Our aim was to develop a mechanistic understanding of the interactions governing adsorptive removal of impurities during filtration by evaluating the effect of various filter types, feed streams, and process conditions on impurity removal. The ionic capacity of these filters was measured and correlated with their ability to remove impurities for multiple molecules. The ionic capacity of AHF significantly exceeded that of traditional adsorptive depth filters (ADF) by 40% for the Emphaze\u2122 AEX and by 700% for the Emphaze\u2122 ST-AEX, providing substantially higher reduction of soluble anionic impurities, including DNA, HCPs and model virus. Nevertheless, we determined that ADF with filter aid provided additional hydrophobic functionality that resulted in removal of higher molecular weight species than AHF. Implementing AHF demonstrated improved process-related impurity removal and viral clearance after Protein A chromatography and enabled a two-step purification process. The consequences of enhanced process performance are far reaching because it allows the downstream polishing train to be restructured and simplified, and chromatographic purity standards to be met with a reduced number of chromatographic steps.",

Li\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Recent progress in mammalian cell culture process has resulted in significantly increased product titers, but also a substantial increase in process- and product-related impurities. Due to the diverse physicochemical properties of these impurities, there is constant need for new technologies that offer higher productivity and improved economics without sacrificing the process robustness required to meet final drug substance specifications. Here, we examined the use of new synthetic adsorptive hybrid filters (AHF) modified with the high binding capacity of quaternary amine (Emphaze\u2122 AEX) and salt-tolerant biomimetic (Emphaze\u2122 ST-AEX) ligands for clearance of process-related impurities like host cell protein (HCP), residual DNA, and virus. The potential to remove soluble aggregates was also examined. Our aim was to develop a mechanistic understanding of the interactions governing adsorptive removal of impurities during filtration by evaluating the effect of various filter types, feed streams, and process conditions on impurity removal. The ionic capacity of these filters was measured and correlated with their ability to remove impurities for multiple molecules. The ionic capacity of AHF significantly exceeded that of traditional adsorptive depth filters (ADF) by 40% for the Emphaze\u2122 AEX and by 700% for the Emphaze\u2122 ST-AEX, providing substantially higher reduction of soluble anionic impurities, including DNA, HCPs and model virus. Nevertheless, we determined that ADF with filter aid provided additional hydrophobic functionality that resulted in removal of higher molecular weight species than AHF. Implementing AHF demonstrated improved process-related impurity removal and viral clearance after Protein A chromatography and enabled a two-step purification process. The consequences of enhanced process performance are far reaching because it allows the downstream polishing train to be restructured and simplified, and chromatographic purity standards to be met with a reduced number of chromatographic steps.\n## Introduction\nFurthermore, increasing cell densities, longer cell-culture duration, and higher product titers have challenged the basic design of the downstream train to deal with additional cell mass, cell debris, HCP, DNA, adventitious and endogenous viruses, and other impurities like media components. 5,9 The ability to overcome these obstacles necessitates the development of new materials with unique properties, such as membranes with novel retention or very low-fouling characteristics, chromatographic ligands with unique binding characteristics, materials designed to facilitate non-traditional unit operations (e.g., precipitation, flocculation, high capacity adsorptive filters, and charged ultrafiltration membranes), that have the potential to dramatically improve downstream processing, both in terms of capacity and impurity removal capability.

In this report, the development of a robust high-cell-density fed-batch procedure for the efficient production of a therapeutic hormone is described. The strategy is to guide the process along a predefined profile of the total biomass that was derived from a given specific growth rate profile. This profile might have been built upon experience or derived from numerical process optimization. A surprisingly simple adaptive procedure correcting for deviations from the desired path was developed. In this way the batch-to-batch reproducibility can be drastically improved as compared to the process control strategies typically applied in industry. This applies not only to the biomass but, as the results clearly show, to the product titer also.",

Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product. \n\nFrom the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control. \n\nWith respect to batch-to-batch reproducibility, production processes for recombinant proteins are lagging far behind most other industrial processes. Figure 1 shows a typical example of the repeatability of biomass concentration profiles in a recombinant protein production process. The variability is quite high. \n\nThis fact was recognized by the FDA. The agency responded with a couple of measures. One essential reaction is FDA's PAT initiative [2]. With PAT, improvements in pharmaceutical and biologics production processes with respect to real time automated process monitoring and control are demanded. A rigorous science-based approach to manufacturing is demanded, as better understanding is thought to lead to more efficient process control, lower process variability, thus high product quality and finally patient safety. For biologics it is particularly important to keep the processes under control early in the product synthesis process (e.g., [1]). \n\nIn bioprocess engineering, process monitoring and control is being developed since many years. A review was given by Lee et al. [8]. The objective was to keep the process on trajectories that finally lead to a high value of the desired mass m P of the product. Within a more or less well-defined production time t P , this can be related to biomass by the following expression: \n\nwhere p is the specific product formation rate and x the total biomass. Both arguments of the integral are functions of time, but more importantly, both are primarily dependent on the specific biomass growth rate l in most industrial production systems.",

Jenzsch, Stefan Gnoth, M. Kleinschmidt, R. Simutis, A. L\u00fcbbert\n## Abstract\nIn industry Escherichia coli is the preferred host system for the heterologous biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins that do not need posttranslational modifications. In this report, the development of a robust high-cell-density fed-batch procedure for the efficient production of a therapeutic hormone is described. The strategy is to guide the process along a predefined profile of the total biomass that was derived from a given specific growth rate profile. This profile might have been built upon experience or derived from numerical process optimization. A surprisingly simple adaptive procedure correcting for deviations from the desired path was developed. In this way the batch-to-batch reproducibility can be drastically improved as compared to the process control strategies typically applied in industry. This applies not only to the biomass but, as the results clearly show, to the product titer also.\n## Introduction\nBiologics are known to be rather complex products. Apparently small changes in the manufacturing processes can cause significant differences in their clinical properties. Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product. \n\nFrom the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control. \n\nWith respect to batch-to-batch reproducibility, production processes for recombinant proteins are lagging far behind most other industrial processes. Figure 1 shows a typical example of the repeatability of biomass concentration profiles in a recombinant protein production process. The variability is quite high. \n\nThis fact was recognized by the FDA. The agency responded with a couple of measures. One essential reaction is FDA's PAT initiative [2]. With PAT, improvements in pharmaceutical and biologics production processes with respect to real time automated process monitoring and control are demanded. A rigorous science-based approach to manufacturing is demanded, as better understanding is thought to lead to more efficient process control, lower process variability, thus high product quality and finally patient safety. For biologics it is particularly important to keep the processes under control early in the product synthesis process (e.g., [1]). \n\nIn bioprocess engineering, process monitoring and control is being developed since many years. A review was given by Lee et al. [8]. The objective was to keep the process on trajectories that finally lead to a high value of the desired mass m P of the product. Within a more or less well-defined production time t P , this can be related to biomass by the following expression: \n\nwhere p is the specific product formation rate and x the total biomass. Both arguments of the integral are functions of time, but more importantly, both are primarily dependent on the specific biomass growth rate l in most industrial production systems.",

                    "text": "During the manufacturing of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) these proteins are susceptible to a host of enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications. Potential modifications include glycosylation, N-terminal glutamine cyclization, aspartate isomerization, C-terminal lysine processing, deamidation, oxidation, glycation, peptide bond cleavage, and disulfide bond reduction and formation [1]. These modifications occur in the production bioreactor during protein expression [2] but modifications can also occur under conditions experienced during antibody purification [3], and storage under final formulation conditions [4,5]. Regulatory agencies recognize the heterogeneous nature of biological therapeutics and have issued guidance on characterizing and monitoring post-translational modifications. According to The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q6B 'The manufacturer should define the pattern of heterogeneity of the desired product and demonstrate consistency with that of the lots used in preclinical and clinical studies.' [6] One method to demonstrate product and process consistency is through monitoring the charge variant distribution through capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) as many of the modifications described above impact the isoelectric point of the protein variant. \n\nGlycation is a post-translational modification that has the potential to significantly alter the charge variant distribution, resulting in lot-to-lot inconsistencies, in part because it is difficult to control. Glycation is the non-enzymatic addition of a sugar molecule to a free amino group on a protein. The reaction can occur both in-vivo [7] and in-vitro [8] and the extent of glycation can be impacted by cell culture conditions, such as glucose levels [8] and the mean residence time of excreted protein in the cell culture media. \n\nPrevious studies have used enrichment techniques to separate the mAbs glycated during the cell culture process and used this material to identify glycation sites. Quan et al. [9] utilized this method of enrichment to identify eight reactive lysines that appeared to have a different susceptibility to glycation.",

Bosley, Kimberly Cook, Shihua Lin, David Robbins\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT The manufacturing of therapeutic biologics can result in a heterogeneous population of charge variants, encompassing many quality attributes which could impact activity and pharmacokinetics. Monitoring the relative abundance of these charge variants to demonstrate process consistency is an expectation of regulatory agencies. Control of the relative abundance of charge variants is also necessary to ensure product comparability across the product lifecycle. We have observed a significant shift in the relative abundance of charged species, as measured by capillary isoelectric focusing, during clarified cell culture fluid holds for several monoclonal antibodies. This lack of stability requires that the hold time for this process intermediate be significantly curtailed, eliminating manufacturing flexibility. We have identified the cause of this shift in relative abundance of charged species as changes in glycation levels, focused predominantly on three conserved, solvent accessible, lysine residues. Mutants of a model protein were generated that show increased charge state stability can be gained by eliminating these reactive lysines. Further, characterization studies were conducted on these mutants to determine the impact to biological activity and stability of the molecule, with no detrimental effects observed. Incorporating this knowledge into the assessments of candidate drugs could allow for the selection of molecules less susceptible to this product degradation pathway, allowing for greater manufacturing flexibility. This process of identifying and removing reactive lysine residues could be useful in the design of drug candidates with improved charge state stability, across a range of modalities. ABSTRACT\n## Introduction\nDuring the manufacturing of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) these proteins are susceptible to a host of enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications. Potential modifications include glycosylation, N-terminal glutamine cyclization, aspartate isomerization, C-terminal lysine processing, deamidation, oxidation, glycation, peptide bond cleavage, and disulfide bond reduction and formation [1]. These modifications occur in the production bioreactor during protein expression [2] but modifications can also occur under conditions experienced during antibody purification [3], and storage under final formulation conditions [4,5]. Regulatory agencies recognize the heterogeneous nature of biological therapeutics and have issued guidance on characterizing and monitoring post-translational modifications. According to The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q6B 'The manufacturer should define the pattern of heterogeneity of the desired product and demonstrate consistency with that of the lots used in preclinical and clinical studies.' [6] One method to demonstrate product and process consistency is through monitoring the charge variant distribution through capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) as many of the modifications described above impact the isoelectric point of the protein variant. \n\nGlycation is a post-translational modification that has the potential to significantly alter the charge variant distribution, resulting in lot-to-lot inconsistencies, in part because it is difficult to control. Glycation is the non-enzymatic addition of a sugar molecule to a free amino group on a protein. The reaction can occur both in-vivo [7] and in-vitro [8] and the extent of glycation can be impacted by cell culture conditions, such as glucose levels [8] and the mean residence time of excreted protein in the cell culture media. \n\nPrevious studies have used enrichment techniques to separate the mAbs glycated during the cell culture process and used this material to identify glycation sites. Quan et al. [9] utilized this method of enrichment to identify eight reactive lysines that appeared to have a different susceptibility to glycation.",

This new platform was observed to have excellent impurity clearance at high mAb loadings with overall mAb yield exceeding 80%. Robust removal of DNA and host cell protein was demonstrated by activated carbon and a new flow-through cation exchange resin exhibited excellent clearance of mAb aggregate with high monomer recoveries. A ten-fold improvement of mAb loading was achieved compared to a traditional cation exchange resin designed for bind and elute mode. High throughput 96-well plate screening was used for process optimization, focusing on mAb loading and solution conditions. Optimum operating windows for integrated flow-through purification are proposed based on performance characteristics. The combination of an all flow-through polishing process presents significant opportunities for improvements in facility utilization and process economics.",

A template process enables rapid process definition and has proven successful for the production of large quantities of mAb. 2 Current large-scale batch manufacturers, however, still face several challenges, including high operating costs and high capital investment costs for upstream and downstream processing, 3 the speed of both scale-up and transfer, 4 and a large equipment footprint with tank-to-tank liquid transfer. 2 Integrated and continuous manufacturing has been proposed as an advanced processing method to address these challenges. 5 he potential advantages of integrated processing over a conventional approach include shorter processing times and reduced operator interventions, which may increase operational efficiency. Moreover, the use of smaller equipment and facilities will offer greater flexibility for manufacturing volume. Implementation strategies for continuous processing composed of individual unit operations have been reviewed and discussed, [6][7][8] including direct chromatography column loading, 9 in-line dilution, 10 multi-column capture 11 and single pass tangential flow filtration. 12 Furthermore, many companies have conducted their own evaluations and feasibility studies for continuous processing. 13,14,15  the biopharmaceutical industry, chromatography is a widely used separation and purification technology due to its high resolution. The bioreactor harvest is followed by at least three unit operations, including primary capture, secondary purification, and final polishing. The majority of purification processes for mAbs involve capture with a Protein A-based chromatography media, which results in a high degree of purity and recovery in a single step. Continuous processing comprising high-density perfusion cell culture and a directly coupled continuous capture chromatography can be successfully implemented as a universal biomanufacturing platform obviating the bottleneck of bioprocess scaling. 13 he purification and polishing steps generally incorporate cation and anion exchange chromatography, although hydrophobic interaction chromatography, mixed mode chromatography or hydroxyapatite chromatography may be used. 16",

Gillespie\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT An integrated all flow-through technology platform for the purification of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb), consisting of activated carbon and flow-through cation and anion exchange chromatography steps, can replace a conventional chromatography platform. This new platform was observed to have excellent impurity clearance at high mAb loadings with overall mAb yield exceeding 80%. Robust removal of DNA and host cell protein was demonstrated by activated carbon and a new flow-through cation exchange resin exhibited excellent clearance of mAb aggregate with high monomer recoveries. A ten-fold improvement of mAb loading was achieved compared to a traditional cation exchange resin designed for bind and elute mode. High throughput 96-well plate screening was used for process optimization, focusing on mAb loading and solution conditions. Optimum operating windows for integrated flow-through purification are proposed based on performance characteristics. The combination of an all flow-through polishing process presents significant opportunities for improvements in facility utilization and process economics.\n## Introduction\nMonoclonal antibody (mAb) purification technologies and processes for biopharmaceutical manufacturing have matured substantially since the introduction of platform purification processes based on a common sequence of batch unit operations. 1 Most of these efforts have focused on improving existing process templates through the introduction of high-performance purification technologies. A template process enables rapid process definition and has proven successful for the production of large quantities of mAb. 2 Current large-scale batch manufacturers, however, still face several challenges, including high operating costs and high capital investment costs for upstream and downstream processing, 3 the speed of both scale-up and transfer, 4 and a large equipment footprint with tank-to-tank liquid transfer. 2 Integrated and continuous manufacturing has been proposed as an advanced processing method to address these challenges. 5 he potential advantages of integrated processing over a conventional approach include shorter processing times and reduced operator interventions, which may increase operational efficiency. Moreover, the use of smaller equipment and facilities will offer greater flexibility for manufacturing volume. Implementation strategies for continuous processing composed of individual unit operations have been reviewed and discussed, [6][7][8] including direct chromatography column loading, 9 in-line dilution, 10 multi-column capture 11 and single pass tangential flow filtration. 12 Furthermore, many companies have conducted their own evaluations and feasibility studies for continuous processing. 13,14,15  the biopharmaceutical industry, chromatography is a widely used separation and purification technology due to its high resolution. The bioreactor harvest is followed by at least three unit operations, including primary capture, secondary purification, and final polishing. The majority of purification processes for mAbs involve capture with a Protein A-based chromatography media, which results in a high degree of purity and recovery in a single step. Continuous processing comprising high-density perfusion cell culture and a directly coupled continuous capture chromatography can be successfully implemented as a universal biomanufacturing platform obviating the bottleneck of bioprocess scaling. 13 he purification and polishing steps generally incorporate cation and anion exchange chromatography, although hydrophobic interaction chromatography, mixed mode chromatography or hydroxyapatite chromatography may be used. 16",

Brorson\n## Abstract\nFormulating appropriate storage conditions for biopharmaceutical proteins is essential for ensuring their stability and thereby their purity, potency, and safety over their shelf-life. Using a model murine IgG3 produced in a bioreactor system, multiple formulation compositions were systematically explored in a DoE design to optimize the stability of a challenging antibody formulation worst case. The stability of the antibody in each buffer formulation was assessed by UV/VIS absorbance at 280\u2009nm and 410\u2009nm and size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SEC) to determine overall solubility, opalescence, and aggregate formation, respectively. Upon preliminary testing, acetate was eliminated as a potential storage buffer due to significant visible precipitate formation. An additional 24 full factorial DoE was performed that combined the stabilizing effect of arginine with the buffering capacity of histidine. From this final DoE, an optimized formulation of 200\u2009mM arginine, 50\u2009mM histidine, and 100\u2009mM NaCl at a pH of 6.5 was identified to substantially improve stability under long-term storage conditions and after multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Thus, our data highlights the power of DoE based formulation screening approaches even for challenging monoclonal antibody molecules.\n## Introduction\nThe manufacturing of biotechnology products is a complex logistical process that connects multiple unit operations and often leads to lengthy in-process hold times or bulk drug substance storage.

Within this market, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the dominant product class. With the patent expirations, biosimilars and, perhaps more relevant, biobetters, are in fast development. Thus, a comprehensive characterization at the molecular level of antibodies heterogeneity such as glycoforms, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and sequence variations is of utmost importance. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches are undoubtedly the most powerful analytical strategies to monitor and define an array of critical quality attributes on mAbs. In this work, we demonstrate the analytical power of the Q-TOF MS platform for comprehensive and detailed analysis at molecular levels of an in-house produced mAb. This methodology involves minimal sample preparation procedures and provides an extensive collection of valuable data in a short period of time.",

                    "text": "At present, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to treat several clinical conditions such as cancer, metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases [1,2]. mAbs are the most important product class in the biopharmaceutical industry [3], being produced by recombinant protein technology. The clinical demands for new therapies and for products that meet safety and efficiency requirements have placed increasing pressure on the development and manufacturing processes [4]. Both processes must be highly productive and cost-effective. To meet this demand, analytical assays are critical, especially when dealing with such complex entities as mAbs. \n\nAn in-depth characterization of mAbs is of utmost importance not only before they can be used in clinical trials but also during product development stages. PTMs including oxidation, deamidation, glycosylation, glycation, proteolysis, and others, may significantly alter the efficacy and safety of the protein drug [5][6][7][8][9]. Thus, regulatory agencies require a full characterization of the structural, biological and chemical heterogeneity of any biological drug product [10]. mAbs characterization is analytical challenging as these products are inherently heterogeneous, due to the presence of PTMs, incomplete processing, susceptibility to degradation and disulphide shuffling [6,[11][12][13]. \n\nIdeally, the methodologies applied to monitor the final product quality should also be applied throughout the entire pipeline to provide qualitative and quantitative information. This will enable optimization of parameters/operations in different stages of the protein drug lifecycle, from clone selection and product development to quality control and drug disposition. To comply with these requests, the analytical methods employed must provide detailed information, and ideally should be fast and with little sample manipulation. \n\nAn array of methods and separation techniques are used to monitor intact antibody process consistency and identify product variants and impurities. These include capillary electrophoresis and chromatography methodologies as ion exchange, reversed-phase, size-exclusion or hydrophobic-interaction [13]. These methods are time-consuming, require several instrumental setups and specific sample preparation methodology.",

Gomes, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Almeida, C. Correia, Ana C L Guerreiro, A. Simpl\u00edcio, I. A. Abreu, Patr\u00edcia Gomes Soares Alves\n## Abstract\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is growing at a fast pace, making nowadays 20% of the pharma market. Within this market, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the dominant product class. With the patent expirations, biosimilars and, perhaps more relevant, biobetters, are in fast development. Thus, a comprehensive characterization at the molecular level of antibodies heterogeneity such as glycoforms, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and sequence variations is of utmost importance. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches are undoubtedly the most powerful analytical strategies to monitor and define an array of critical quality attributes on mAbs. In this work, we demonstrate the analytical power of the Q-TOF MS platform for comprehensive and detailed analysis at molecular levels of an in-house produced mAb. This methodology involves minimal sample preparation procedures and provides an extensive collection of valuable data in a short period of time.\n## Introduction\nAt present, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to treat several clinical conditions such as cancer, metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases [1,2]. mAbs are the most important product class in the biopharmaceutical industry [3], being produced by recombinant protein technology. The clinical demands for new therapies and for products that meet safety and efficiency requirements have placed increasing pressure on the development and manufacturing processes [4]. Both processes must be highly productive and cost-effective. To meet this demand, analytical assays are critical, especially when dealing with such complex entities as mAbs. \n\nAn in-depth characterization of mAbs is of utmost importance not only before they can be used in clinical trials but also during product development stages. PTMs including oxidation, deamidation, glycosylation, glycation, proteolysis, and others, may significantly alter the efficacy and safety of the protein drug [5][6][7][8][9]. Thus, regulatory agencies require a full characterization of the structural, biological and chemical heterogeneity of any biological drug product [10]. mAbs characterization is analytical challenging as these products are inherently heterogeneous, due to the presence of PTMs, incomplete processing, susceptibility to degradation and disulphide shuffling [6,[11][12][13]. \n\nIdeally, the methodologies applied to monitor the final product quality should also be applied throughout the entire pipeline to provide qualitative and quantitative information. This will enable optimization of parameters/operations in different stages of the protein drug lifecycle, from clone selection and product development to quality control and drug disposition. To comply with these requests, the analytical methods employed must provide detailed information, and ideally should be fast and with little sample manipulation. \n\nAn array of methods and separation techniques are used to monitor intact antibody process consistency and identify product variants and impurities. These include capillary electrophoresis and chromatography methodologies as ion exchange, reversed-phase, size-exclusion or hydrophobic-interaction [13]. These methods are time-consuming, require several instrumental setups and specific sample preparation methodology.",

Eslami, Alois Jungbauer\n## Abstract\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly advancing, driven by the need for cutting\u2010edge technologies to meet the growing demand for life\u2010saving treatments. In this context, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a promising solution to address the complexity of modern biopharmaceutical production processes. Its ability to optimize operations and ensure consistent product yields has made it an attractive option for manufacturers in this sector. Furthermore, MPC's alignment with the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative provides an additional layer of assurance, facilitating real\u2010time monitoring and enabling swift adjustments to maintain process integrity. This comprehensive review delves into the various applications of MPC, ranging from robust control to stochastic model predictive control, thereby equipping biotechnologists and process engineers with a powerful toolset. By harnessing the capabilities of MPC, as elucidated in this review, manufacturers can confidently navigate the intricate bioprocessing landscape and unlock this approach's full potential in their production processes.\n## | Biotechnology\nProduction of biological products is often divided into two main steps, the upstream processing in a bioreactor and the downstream processing for the recovery of the product by a combination of centrifugation, filtration, chromatography, and membrane filtration.\n\nAs the upstream processing is the initial step in biotechnology, thus product quality is of paramount importance, and optimizing this step leads to significant improvements in overall production.\n\nUpstream processing involves cell cultivation and harvesting biological material, such as proteins, enzymes, and antibodies, while maintaining its quality and purity.The outcome of this step is heavily dependent on controlling and maintaining process variables such as nutrition feeding, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen at an optimal level.This step can be performed via batch, fed-batch, or perfusion modes, each with its advantages and limitations.Similarly, downstream processing poses challenges due to the complexity and variability of the starting material.Multi-component adsorption isotherms, variable impurities, and contaminants in the crude feedstock make it challenging to design and optimize downstream processing steps, such as purification and separation.\n\nIn discussing the challenges faced by the biopharmaceutical industry in meeting the growing demand for biologics while maintaining quality requirements, Narayanan et al. 191 highlight the need for advancements in bioprocessing, particularly in process intensification, to address these challenges.In addition, they stress the importance of collaborations between different parties to establish a more digitalized and automated biotherapeutic process development and manufacturing, aligning the industry with the standards of Industry 4.0.\n\nModel predictive control offers a promising solution to ensure the final product meets the required specifications.In addition, MPC can exploit the benefits of the process by minimizing by-products, improving productivity and yield, and even reducing production costs.\n\nHowever, as stated before, the performance of any model-based controller, including MPC, largely depends on the accuracy of the process model used.In the context of bioprocessing, obtaining a reliable and accurate process model is particularly challenging given model uncertainties, the system's nonlinear structure, and the slow process dynamics. 192,193The complexity of process models primarily arises from the high sensitivity of biological products to process conditions, including temperature, pH, and substrate concentrations.",

Considering the paradigm shift towards the design of continuously operating dedicated plants at smaller scales\u2014with or without disposable technology\u2014for treating smaller patient populations due to new indications or personalized medicine approaches, the rising need for new, innovative strategies for both clarification and capture technology becomes evident. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) is now considered to be a feasible unit operation, e.g., for the capture of monoclonal antibodies or recombinant proteins. However, most of the published work so far investigates the applicability of ATPE in antibody-manufacturing processes at the lab-scale and for the most part, only during the capture step. This work shows the integration of ATPE as a combined harvest and capture step into a downstream process. Additionally, a model is applied that allows early prediction of settler dimensions with high prediction accuracy. Finally, a reliable process development concept, which guides through the necessary steps, starting from the definition of the separation task to the final stages of integration and scale-up, is presented.",

Post-translational product modifications induced by chemical and enzymatical intra-and extracellular mechanisms during the production process lead to micro-heterogeneity of mAbs, in turn affecting product characteristics (e.g., efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics) [3]. The recombinant cell line, the culture media and the process settings affect these quality attributes [4,5].

Due to numerous modifications, the net surface charge of mAbs can be altered [8][9][10][11]. Charge species with a lower isoelectric point (pI) than the main fraction of the product are defined as acidic variants and generated by sialylation, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, glycation and other mechanisms. Glycation, for instance, is a non-enzymatic reaction where a reducing sugar molecule, most commonly glucose, is covalently bound to a reactive amino group [12]. Basic variants are defined as species with a higher pI than the main fraction and generated by incomplete C-terminal lysine clipping of the heavy chains, as well as by fragmentation and aggregation [13]. Several studies indicate that mAb variants can lead to varying biological responses [14][15][16]. For instance, it was shown that the basic variants exhibited an increased binding to the FC and the neonatal receptor, indicating an increased half-life [15]. Another",

Due to numerous modifications, the net surface charge of mAbs can be altered [8][9][10][11]. Charge species with a lower isoelectric point (pI) than the main fraction of the product are defined as acidic variants and generated by sialylation, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, glycation and other mechanisms. Glycation, for instance, is a non-enzymatic reaction where a reducing sugar molecule, most commonly glucose, is covalently bound to a reactive amino group [12]. Basic variants are defined as species with a higher pI than the main fraction and generated by incomplete C-terminal lysine clipping of the heavy chains, as well as by fragmentation and aggregation [13]. Several studies indicate that mAb variants can lead to varying biological responses [14][15][16]. For instance, it was shown that the basic variants exhibited an increased binding to the FC and the neonatal receptor, indicating an increased half-life [15]. Another",

Results show pink-colored product generated during manufacturing is due to association of hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl), a form of vitamin B 12 . OH-Cbl is not part of the product manufacturing process; however we found cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) in cell culture media converts to OH-Cbl in the presence of light. OH-Cbl can be released from mAb and Fc-fusion proteins by conversion with potassium cyanide to CN-Cbl, which does not bind. By exploiting the differential binding of CN-Cbl and OH-Cbl, we developed a rapid and specific assay to accurately measure B 12 levels in purified protein. Analysis of multiple products and lots using this technique gives insight into color variability during manufacturing. \n\nto monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may co-purify, resulting in a colored final product. 6,7",

            "text": "On top of the formal imperatives reviewed thus far, a number of best practices contribute to quality manufacturing of biologics. First among these is having the necessary knowledge and experience in the manufacturing workforce. Several thousand professionals with a broad range of skills, training and expertise are required to staff the Janssen supply chain, many of whom have 20 + years of research and manufacturing experience with Remicade. This level of continuity is essential to developing and retaining the historical, institutional and product specific knowledge required in this environment. This knowledge, combined with advances in process and analytical technology and internal innovations, has led to continuous improvements in testing and control of process/raw material variability, enabling the organization to solve challenges which inevitably arise.\n\nAn example of just such a challenge is handling raw material variability. Of concern to industry and authorities alike is the potential impact of shifts in trace metal content in cell culture media components on antibody glycosylation. Years of research have given Janssen an understanding of the highly complex relationship between trace metals and post-translational modifications of the antibody. This understanding, which is specific to the cell line and source materials used, has enabled Janssen to minimize the occurrence of these shifts and limit their impact on the final product. Close partnerships with the suppliers of these media components facilitate proactive quality control and lead to quick resolution in the event of unexpected shifts.\n\nAnother best practice is strategic short-and long-term forecasting of demand to ensure reliability of supply. Each site in the Remicade supply chain network utilizes sophisticated local and global forecasting tools, which enable site manufacturing logistics to plan operations, including transfer of product intermediates between sites to maximize efficiency. Likewise, the need for additional capacity must be identified long in advance, as the construction and regulatory approval of new manufacturing sites can take years. This requires a willingness to invest in costly added capacity before absolute certainty exists that the forecasted growth in market demand will actually materialize.\n\nAbove all else, there can be no shortcuts in product quality and process compliance, and effective management of both is of paramount importance. The magnitude and complexity of the process demand stringent, effective quality systems with appropriate policies and procedures across all phases of manufacturing and distribution. Keeping the facilities and processes up to date with regulatory requirements, technology changes, expanded capacity and global distribution networks is a necessary, ongoing process.",

            "text": "2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11",

These challenges are inherent to the current manufacturing process of mAbs as the production of mAbs is performed in mammalian cell lines followed by purification from complex media, implying that an extensive purification process is needed to obtain a safe formulatable antibody from the cell culture supernatant free from viruses and other contaminants. In addition, monoclonal antibodies are prone to a wide variety of post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, deamidation, oxidation, incomplete disulfide bond formation, N-terminal glutamine cyclization, and C-terminal lysine processing. As these modifications can strongly impact the biological activity and therapeutic properties of the mAbs, they need to be characterized and controlled, necessitating the costly development and implementation of numerous analytical tools to assess these Quality Attributes. All these aspects lead to a challenging production process. At the same time, regulatory agencies ask for enhanced quality while health care systems demand lower process costs.",

Besides, the new suite has two different lyophilizers (Lyo A and Lyo B) that would be used to manufacture the product. The PPQ protocol in the new suite consisted of four runs in total with two batches per product strength: three validation batches to be manufactured in one lyophilizer (Lyo A) to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency and a fourth validation batch to be manufactured in the second lyophilizer (Lyo B) to demonstrate the equivalent performance of the two lyophilizers. The protocol requires that lyophilization process validation should be conducted under anticipated commercial manufacturing conditions. Performance qualification of critical processing equipment was conducted to verify that the equipment performed consistently within defined operating parameters when subjected to normal production conditions. Heat and moisture mapping studies were performed to demonstrate that the two lyophilizers were functionally equivalent. The operational process steps (e.g., filling, lyophilization) for the manufacturing of both strengths were similar, and the vial size and composition were the same for both product strengths; the only difference was in their respective filling volumes. \n\nTable XII shows the validation strategy included in the PPQ protocol at the new suite. Lot 1 represents the worstcase lyophilization condition for condenser capacity as vial strength 'b' had a higher fill volume, i.e., a higher amount of water content (per vial) to be sublimed during primary drying. Lot 3 represents the best-case lyophilization condition, as vial strength 'a' had a lower fill volume. Lyophilizationrelated parameters such as shelf temperature and chamber pressure during drying are considered to be critical process parameters and were monitored in-process. The normal operating range was established by trending process performance from development batches and equipment capability and was to be verified during validation.",

            "text": "The manufacturing of mAbs has evolved significantly over recent decades, with various approaches emerging to address production challenges and economic constraints. This section examines three primary manufacturing strategies, namely,  batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems, analyzing their relative merits and limitations in modern biopharmaceutical production. Batch processing remains the traditional backbone of mAb manufacturing, characterized by discrete production cycles where a single batch is processed from start to finish before initiating the next batch. This approach offers several advantages, including well-established regulatory compliance pathways and simplified process validation. However, batch processing faces limitations in terms of equipment utilization, facility footprint requirements, and operational efficiency. Cost considerations for batch processing are particularly significant, with studies indicating higher capital investment requirements and potentially lower volumetric productivity than in alternative approaches. 8 ontinuous processing has emerged as a promising alternative, offering significant advantages through end-to-end bioprocessing. Recent research demonstrates that single-use continuous facilities can achieve approximately 35% cost savings compared to traditional stainless steel batch facilities in meeting the annual production demand of 100-500 kg. 8 These economic benefits are particularly pronounced at specific production scales and diminish to approximately \u00b110% at higher production volumes (1-3 tons) due to the requirement for multiple parallel continuous trains. Implementation challenges include the requirement of robust process control strategies, real-time monitoring capabilities, and addressing concerns about system stability over extended production runs. 16 ybrid systems represent a middle-ground approach, combining disposable and stainless steel equipment to leverage the advantages of both technologies. Studies have shown that hybrid facilities can achieve faster break-even points, typically 2-2.5 years earlier than the traditional stainless steel facilities. 17 The flexibility benefits of hybrid systems are particularly noteworthy, allowing manufacturers to optimize their process based on scale, product requirements, and economic considerations. Cost analysis reveals that a 3\u00d72000 L bioreactor configuration with pooled harvesting often proves most cost-effective in hybrid setups among all the setups. A comparative analysis of key performance metrics across these manufacturing approaches is presented in Table 2. \n\nGrowing use of continuous processing for monoclonal antibody manufacture clearly marks a paradigm change in manufacturing techniques. David et al 18 conducted a thorough side-by-side comparability research where continuous downstream processing showed equivalent product quality attributes to conventional batch processing with notable benefits.",

            "text": "Purpose This review examines recent advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) manufacturing, focusing on process optimization, cost reduction strategies, and emerging technologies. The analysis addresses critical challenges in current manufacturing processes while evaluating innovative solutions to improve production efficiency and economic viability. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of recent literature on mAb manufacturing, examining traditional batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems. The review evaluates cost optimization strategies, including media development and process integration, while assessing the impact of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, on manufacturing efficiency. Results Recent studies demonstrate that continuous processing can achieve up to 35% cost savings compared to traditional batch processing to meet an annual production demand of 100\u2013500 kg, though this gain diminishes at larger scales. Hybrid facilities show accelerated break-even points, reaching profitability 2\u20132.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. Advanced media optimization strategies, incorporating novel tripeptide delivery methods, have demonstrated up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Integration of machine learning and advanced analytics has significantly enhanced process control and optimization capabilities. Conclusion The evolution of mAb manufacturing technologies offers promising pathways for improving production efficiency and reducing costs. Scale-dependent considerations remain crucial in selecting optimal manufacturing strategies, while emerging technologies present new opportunities for process optimization. Future developments in continuous processing, advanced analytics, and cell line engineering will be essential in meeting growing global demand while ensuring economic viability and accessibility of mAb therapeutics.",

            "text": "Early on in biologics production, manufacturers began to see that manufacturing quality would have to be improved from the processes inherited from LVP and SMD manufacture. With biologics came many additional concerns [14], associated with what had previously been routine processing, including protein aggregation [15,16], siliconization of stoppers [17], coating of vials [18], the existence of particles down to the subvisible range [19], etc. The highly defined conditions under which biologics must be produced has led to the assertion that, for biologics, \"the process is the product\". In addition to process impurities arising from the product expression system which must be removed, it is also true for minute differences (heterogeneities) in the product protein structure itself, especially in protein glycosylation [20,21]. Therefore, for biologics, \"the product is the process.\" Because the finished product cannot be fully characterized in the laboratory, manufacturers must ensure product consistency, quality, and purity by ensuring that the manufacturing process remains substantially the same over time. By contrast, a drug manufacturer can change the manufacturing process extensively and analyze the finished product to establish that it is the same as before the manufacturing change.\n\nThe living systems used to produce biologics can be sensitive to very minor changes in the manufacturing process. Small process differences can significantly affect the nature of the finished biologic and, most importantly, the way it functions in the body. To ensure that a manufacturing process remains the same over time, biologics manufacturers must tightly control the source and nature of starting materials, and consistently employ hundreds of process controls that assure predictable manufacturing outcomes [22].\n\nOvert differences exist between SMD manufacturing based on chemical synthesis (e.g. gemcitabine at MW 263 or cisplatin, MW 300) and growth-based biologics production (e.g. Trastuzumab at MW 145,532 or Adalimumab at MW 144,190). The modes of action of these four drugs will be briefly compared below. Figure 8.4 shows a simplified manufacturing process flow for a common biologic, a monoclonal antibody, and associated ICH quality requirements.\n\nDue to their complex nature and the limited clinical experience with biologics such as chi",

For antibody manufacturing process development, maintaining desired quality attributes while reducing time to market, maintaining cost effectiveness, and providing manufacturing flexibility are key issues in today's competitive market, where several companies are often working on therapies for similar targets and clinical indications. Since antibody therapies may require large doses over a long period of time, manufacturing capacity becomes an issue because the drug substance must be produced in large quantities with cost and time efficiency to meet clinical requirements and pave the way toward commercialization. In response to the strong demand, many companies have built large scale manufacturing plants containing multiple 10,000 L or larger cell culture bioreactors. \n\nIn terms of manufacturability and scalability, mammalian cells have historically been considered difficult to work with due to factors such as low yield, medium complexity, serum requirement, and shear sensitivity, although the latter has generally been incorrectly overemphasized. After two decades of intensive development work in cell line, media and bioreactor condition optimization, cell specific productivity of over 20 pg/cell/day can be routinely achieved for production cell lines; 1 high titers up to \u223c10 g/L and cell densities of over 20 million cells/mL in fed-batch processes have been recently reported by a few companies at major conferences. The enhancement of specific productivity per cell is achieved not only by selection of highly productive clones, but also by optimization of medium composition and bioreactor operation conditions. Today, the combination of high titers and large capacity has gradually shifted the focus of cell culture process development from pursing even higher titers to controlling product quality and process consistency at all development stages and production scales. 3 ell culture process development starts with cell line generation and selection, followed by process and media optimization in small scale systems, including 96-well plates, shaker flasks, and bench-scale bioreactors, for high throughput screening purposes.",

            "text": "David et al 18 conducted a thorough side-by-side comparability research where continuous downstream processing showed equivalent product quality attributes to conventional batch processing with notable benefits. By 6-fold and chromatography resin use by 2.4-fold compared to fed-batch platforms, the study found that continuous manufacturing drastically cut buffer consumption. Moreover, they showed that changing from batch to continuous processing had no appreciable effect on final drug substance properties like stability profiles, processrelated contaminants, and product quality parameters. This highlights the possibility of using constant manufacturing at any level of the product life. Botelho Ferreira et al 19 also showed another creative way by effectively using the current fed-batch infrastructure for continuous processing, thereby implementing a hybrid manufacturing technique. Their approach performed perfusion operation in a 200-L single-use bioreactor using downstream processes intended for future continuous manufacturing platform compatibility. By allowing 2.1 kg of monoclonal antibody to be produced in two GMP runs, this method showed that \"existing fed-batch infrastructure can be adapted to continuous manufacturing without significant additional investments\". Cha et al 20  commercial-scale production, determining that perfusion cultures attained 1.6-fold higher peak viable cell density with longer culture duration, thus generating a total product amount increase of over 450% while improving purification yield. Their economic study indicated that perfusion mode might lower the cost of goods while preserving product quality, therefore demonstrating its feasibility as a practical method of commercial antibody manufacturing. The choice of these manufacturing approaches depends on various factors, such as production scale, facility constraints, and economic objectives. While continuous processing shows promise of cost reduction and improved efficiency, batch processing maintains advantages in regulatory compliance and operational simplicity. Hybrid systems offer a balanced approach, particularly suitable for facilities requiring flexibility in production capacity and product types.",

[3][4][5] These product variants also may present a risk to product stability during storage, resulting in shorter shelf life. [3][4][5][6] In recent years, with the development of high-titer mammalian cell culture processes, interchain disulfide bond reduction has been observed more often after cell culture harvest, resulting in additional productrelated impurities. [6][7][8] Intracellular components, such as thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, have been shown to be largely responsible for disulfide bond reduction. [7][8][9][10] To ensure antibody product quality, manufacturing in-process controls are necessary to control LMW species formed from reduction of antibody disulfide bonds. As a result, several strategies across the industry have been proposed to control disulfide reduction in manufacturing, including maintaining harvest dissolved oxygen, chilling the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), and limiting the HCCF hold time. 7,8,[11][12][13] Despite implementing active mitigation strategies to prevent disulfide reduction, occasional disulfide reduction can occur during a manufacturing run, resulting in out-ofspecification batches and substantial increases in the cost of goods.\n\nDue to the limitations of the above-mentioned mitigation strategies to completely prevent disulfide bond reduction, a method to rescue the \"failed\" batches (i.e., batches with high levels of LMW species) would be highly valuable. We thus posed the following question: is it possible to eliminate LMW issues through downstream process development?

Post-translational modifications affect the micro-heterogeneity of the product and thereby influence important quality attributes, such as stability, solubility, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The analysis of the surface charge distribution of monoclonal antibodies provides aggregated information about these modifications. In this work, we established a direct injection pH gradient cation exchange chromatography method, which determines charge heterogeneity from cell culture supernatant without any purification steps. This tool was further applied to monitor processes that were performed under certain process conditions. Concretely, we were able to provide insights into charge variant formation during a fed-batch process of a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, in turn producing a monoclonal antibody under varying temperatures and glucose feed strategies. Glucose concentration impacted the total emergence of acidic variants, whereas the variation of basic species was mainly dependent on process temperature. The formation rates of acidic species were described with a second-order reaction, where a temperature increase favored the conversion. This platform method will aid as a sophisticated optimization tool for mammalian cell culture processes. It provides a quality fingerprint for the produced mAb, which can be tested, compared to the desired target and confirmed early in the process chain.",

Despite these successes, T-cell-based immunotherapies are constrained by time-intensive, high cost, complex manufacturing processes that are time-intensive, expensive, and difficult to scale 3,4 and lack methods and tools to predict the end-product quality during manufacturing. Quality assessment is performed only at the end of manufacturing which takes many days. Identification of early putative critical quality attributes (CQAs) and the associated critical process parameters (CPPs) that can be measured nondestructively during culture and can predict end-product attributes early in the manufacturing timeline could be transformative for the cell therapy field.\n\nTranslating laboratory-scale T-cell expansion experiments into a large-scale manufacturing process is hindered by the incomplete understanding of cell properties and how they are affected by process variables, lack of detailed characterization, and high variability of materials during manufacturing. 5 These challenges of manufacturing a \"living product\" are further magnified since current chemistry, manufacturing, and control, analytics, regulations, and product specifications are designed for conventional chemical and biopharmaceutical manufacturing systems. 6 This underscores the need to develop innovative tools, methods, and standards to ensure appropriate quality controls, and new strategies involving quality by design and good manufacturing practices for cell-based therapies. [7][8][9] The intricate manufacturing process for T cells and other cell therapies must be deeply assessed and appropriately controlled to ensure scalability, predictability, and a high-quality manufacturing process at the most reasonable cost. A key step for reaching this goal is to identify putative CQAs and CPPs early in the manufacturing process that can predict the quality of the manufactured cell-therapy product. We hypothesized that rigorous characterization of process parameters along with longitudinal measurements of cell-secreted cytokine, chemokine, and metabolites from the culture media early during manufacturing will allow us to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)based mathematical-computational framework for the identification of multivariate parameters that are predict",

            "text": "Recombinant production methods result to highly stable and therefore advantageous products, encompassing a proven track record of clinical safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of unknown side effects, carrier-related allergic reactions and withdrawals. These vaccines require minimal maintenance to preserve their stability and functionality hence they can be stored at temperature between 2 to 8 \u00b0C for long periods, and can be maintained before use at room temperature with no decomposition. Consequently, this feature ameliorates any respective logistical challenges and minimizes the risks related to post-production regulatory withdrawals. From Chinese Ovary Cell and bacterial cell factories to the necessary chromatographic resins, all the components required for production are accessible for the pharmaceutical industry, with negligible chances of future shortages and extreme price fluctuations, even in case when industrial scale quantities are required. However, it is uncertain whether relying on this production scenario could be successful under the capacities required in case of pandemic outbreaks i.e. whether the economies of scale required should be reached in short time. One of the major drawbacks of the recombinant DNA vaccine production platform is its complicated and therefore difficult-toautomate sub-processes, which constitute any standardization efforts a challenge. As a result, this technology requires additional personnel for process supervision and control purposes. Consequently, the above-mentioned intrinsic barriers constitute the platform less appropriate for encountering pandemic bursts or even following up their mutations, whereas in such cases delay of response can cause devastating results to global health systems and to patients. Furthermore, cellular protein production carries high risk of material contamination, particularly in the upstream processing. The cells used are complex and require strict sanitization measures, which increases the likelihood of contamination and costs. In the event of contamination, the cell line and its products must be discarded, resulting in additional delays and hard to predict financial losses. In addition to contamination risks, recombinant DNA and protein production methods feature low production yield due to the nature of the related live processes. For the monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA platform, in the best-case study scenario for every kilogram that is produced in the upstream line, only 600-700 g are obtained in the required by the regulatory agencies' purity.",

Identification of appropriate storage conditions and optimized buffer systems for biopharmaceutical proteins is essential in ensuring the stability of these products and therefore maintaining the purity, potency, safety, and efficacy of these drug substances throughout the manufacturing process. A typical purification scheme for monoclonal antibodies involves Protein A affinity chromatography followed by polishing chromatography and filtration steps, with an end product of concentrated antibody in a mild acid to neutral pH solution, prior to drug substance formulation. Selection of a suitable buffer system that mitigates physical and chemical degredation of monoclonal antibodies, especially one that minimizes aggregate and particle formation is an important consideration for efficient downstream fill-finish operations and long-term stability [1]. Parameters that are typically studied include solution pH, buffering system, inclusion of saccharides, tonicity agents, detergents, and other excipients [2,3]. \n\nRegulatory guidance stipulates that antibodies intended for human subjects are tested both at lot release and in stability studies [4] for a variety of product attributes, including opalescence and degradation products such as aggregates, particles, or precipitate formation. These undesirable degradation products may be associated with immune responses [5] and in extreme cases can lead to loss of significant monomer content or protein insolubility, impacting potency, and efficacy to the point where it is unacceptable to use in humans. \n\nIn this study we use a monoclonal antibody cell culture system that was developed by hybridoma technology and has been used by several academic groups to evaluate different 2 BioMed Research International aspects of manufacturing from cell culture to formulated bulk drug substance [6][7][8][9][10]. This model murine IgG3, while not a humanized antibody suitable for clinical use, has no proprietary entanglements and can be successfully used as a model for bioreactor produced monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Disulfide bond reduction, which commonly occurs during monoclonal antibody (mAb) manufacturing processes, can result in a drug substance with high levels of low molecular weight (LMW) species that may fail release specifications because the drug\u2019s safety and the efficiency may be affected by the presence of this material. We previously studied disulfide reoxidation of mAbs and demonstrated that disulfide bonds could be reformed from the reduced antibody via redox reactions under an optimal redox condition on Protein A resin. The study here implements a redox system in a manufacturing setting to rescue the reduced mAb product and to further eliminate LMW issues in downstream processing. As such, we incorporate the optimized redox system as one of the wash buffers in Protein A chromatography to enable an on-column disulfide reoxidation to form intact antibody in vitro. Studies at laboratory scale (1 cm (ID) x 20 cm (Height), MabSelect SuRe LX) and pilot scale (30 cm (ID) x 20 cm (Height), MabSelect SuRe LX) were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of disulfide formation with multiple mAbs using redox wash on Protein A columns. By applying this rescue strategy using \u226450 g/L-resin loading, the intact mAb purity was improved from <5% in the Protein A column load to >90% in the Protein A column elution with a product yield of >90%. Studies were also done to confirm that adding the redox wash has no negative impact on process yield or impurity removal or product quality. The rescued mAbs were confirmed to form complete interchain disulfide bonds, exhibiting comparable biophysical properties to the reference material. Furthermore, since the redox wash is followed by a bridging buffer wash before the final elution, no additional burden is involved in removing the redox components during the downstream steps. Due to its ease of implementation, significant product purity improvement, and minimal impact on other product quality attributes, we demonstrate that the on-column reoxidation using a redox system is a powerful, simple, and safe tool to recover reduced mAb during manufacturing. Moreover, the apparent benefits of using a high-pH redox wash may further drive the evolution of Protein A platform processes.",

            "text": "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.",

            "text": "Over the past three decades, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have made astounding development. Sales of mAbs are expected to reach 125 billion US dollars by 2020 [1][2]. In 2017, of the top ten best-selling pharmaceutical products, six were monoclonal antibodies, of which Humira topped the list with $16 billion. In the past 10 years, the research and development of therapeutic monoclonal drugs in China has also rapidly risen. Some leading enterprises, such as Sansheng Guojian, Chengdu Kanghong, and Topallies and so on, have emerged. In the meantime, hundreds of other enterprises are rapidly following up [2][3]. \n\nIt is a huge challenge to obtain a robust process and achieve the consistency of product quality, because most of the antibody drugs are produced from mammalian cells and the production processes are long and complex [4][5]. Therefore, how to develop a robust and high-yield production process that can be scaled up to meet the needs of the market is a key issue that every company must address. To develop a robust and consistent process, we need to have a general understanding of the entire R&D project flow: what the indications are; what the market may need; the route of administration (intravenous vs. subcutaneous); possible dosage and dosing frequency; operating space or time left by competitors, etc. From the above information, one can set up a goal for designing a process development. In this review, combined with the development of new technologies in recent years and the personal working experience, the factors to be considered in process development are discussed.",

            "text": "Biologics are known to be rather complex products. Apparently small changes in the manufacturing processes can cause significant differences in their clinical properties. Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product. \n\nFrom the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control. \n\nWith respect to batch-to-batch reproducibility, production processes for recombinant proteins are lagging far behind most other industrial processes. Figure 1 shows a typical example of the repeatability of biomass concentration profiles in a recombinant protein production process. The variability is quite high. \n\nThis fact was recognized by the FDA. The agency responded with a couple of measures. One essential reaction is FDA's PAT initiative [2]. With PAT, improvements in pharmaceutical and biologics production processes with respect to real time automated process monitoring and control are demanded. A rigorous science-based approach to manufacturing is demanded, as better understanding is thought to lead to more efficient process control, lower process variability, thus high product quality and finally patient safety. For biologics it is particularly important to keep the processes under control early in the product synthesis process (e.g., [1]). \n\nIn bioprocess engineering, process monitoring and control is being developed since many years. A review was given by Lee et al. [8]. The objective was to keep the process on trajectories that finally lead to a high value of the desired mass m P of the product. Within a more or less well-defined production time t P , this can be related to biomass by the following expression: \n\nwhere p is the specific product formation rate and x the total biomass. Both arguments of the integral are functions of time, but more importantly, both are primarily dependent on the specific biomass growth rate l in most industrial production systems.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as a major class of biological therapeutics, playing, nowadays, a key role in the pharmaceutical industry. Presenting a high rate of approval, the number of commercially available mAbs has been increasing drastically. As of 2019, more than 60 therapeutic mAbs have been marketing approved, which is a significant percentage of the global drug market. There are several mAbs in the top 10 of the best-selling drugs, generating annual revenues on the billion-dollar scale [1][2][3]. \n\nMost of the approved therapeutic mAbs are targeting oncological, immune-mediated, and infectious diseases. However, their applications are expanding into other indications [3][4][5]. New modalities are appearing and currently there are more than 80 mAbs in late-stage clinical studies [2]. The demand for new biotherapeutic products to treat unmet clinical needs together with mAbs' potential is an indication that the mAb field will continue to grow. Therefore, it is expected that mAbs will persist as part of the therapeutic pipeline of the biopharmaceutical industry [5,6]. \n\nIn parallel with this growth, there is an increasing pressure to achieve high-quality products by improved development and manufacturing processes, which will not only meet high safety and efficacy requirements but also result in increased cost-effectiveness and high productivity. These aspects are important at all times but are particularly essential in the case of a pandemic, where there is a demand for extremely swift processes and rapid quality control [7][8][9]. Concerning these aspects, regulatory expectations have increased, and Quality by Design (QbD) strategies are now being used to guide the processes in the biopharmaceutical industry. This approach requires an in-depth product characterization and process understanding only possible through an accurate definition of critical quality attributes (CQA), \"a physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality\" [10] and critical process parameters (CPP), a variable that can impact the CQA.",

            "text": ", and posttranslation modifications (e.g., glycosylation, oxidation, glycation, cysteine-related variants) (Beck et al., 2012;Zhou and Kantardjieff, 2013). Monitoring and controlling product-related variants are vital to ensure consistent drug safety and efficacy. Recently there have been numerous reports describing monoclonal antibody heterogeneities related to trisulfide bonds (TSBs), defined under cysteinerelated variants (Gu et al., 2010;Kita et al., 2016;Kshirsagar et al., 2012;Liu and May, 2012;Nielsen et al., 2011;Pristatsky et al., 2009). Trisulfides are typically formed through the insertion of a sulfur atom into a disulfide bond within the inter-chain linkages between the light and heavy chains of the antibody structure. The TSB modifies these linkages, which are essential to ensure the stability of the antibody and can subsequently influence its biological functionality and activity (Kita et al., 2016).\n\nRegulatory approval for process commercialization requires evaluation of parameters on process performance and product quality (Kirdar et al., 2007;Li et al., 2010). Therefore, early stage investigation of product quality issues is essential to ensure accelerated process development timelines. These product heterogeneities can be influenced by environmental changes including time-series fluctuations of variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature (Bareither and Pollard, 2011;Gomez et al., 2010;Kantardjieff and Zhou, 2013). Therefore multifactorial statistical experimentation involving both on-and off-line process adjustments are essential to investigate the potential complex interactions affecting product quality attributes.\n\nTo facilitate these multifactorial experiments, industry has invested heavily in the application of high-throughput (HT) micro-bioreactor systems that have been extensively demonstrated to replicate laboratory and large-scale systems (Bareither and Pollard, 2011;Lewis et al., 2010;Long et al., 2014;Micheletti and Lye, 2006;Rameez et al., 2014). However, as these systems are expected to evolve and improve in the coming years (\u0141acki, 2014), the current challenge involves",

            "text": "The current manufacturing processes for cell and gene therapies are largely manual, mostly performed in planar culture systems. These are highly laborious, often involve open processes which are difficult to scale-up and rely heavily on the operator's experience and judgement. As a consequence, they are prone to human error and they can result in increased batch-tobatch variability, high manufacturing costs, increased risk of contamination and batch loss.\n\nCell and gene therapies typically rely on patient or donor cells as starting material for their manufacture which determines significant batch-to-batch variation inherent to the complexity of the biological product (Heathman et al. 2016). When manufacturing such highly complex products, it is highly important to acknowledge that any change, regardless of how minor in the culture environment as determined by the manufacturing process may result in the alteration of product quality which is a key determinant of its safety and efficacy (Morrow et al. 2017). In order to comply with these requirements, it is suggested that the manufacturing process should be simple enough to allow reproducibility and of a short duration to minimise costs associated with resources and labour (Masri et al. 2017).\n\nWhat is more is that cell and gene therapy products are not only highly complex, but at the same time, they have to comply with the strict regulatory framework. There is a requirement that these cell-based products are produced in accordance with good manufacturing practise (GMP) which will minimise process variability and therefore variation in cell quality. GMP compliance can be achieved when consistent GMP-grade materials from well-characterised sources are utilised (Medicine Manufacturing Industry Partnership 2016). However full GMP-compliance in the cell and gene therapy realm is currently challenging, particularly because of the increased difficulty in sourcing compliant starting material. This challenge is exacerbated when taking into account the variability associated with manufacturing patient-specific therapies (autologous) where the donor is the diseased patient which means that cell quality will not be of the required standard.\n\nIn contrast to 'traditional' biopharmaceutical production where processes are based on one, well characterized strain and can be repeated relatively well, cell and gene therapy manufacturing processes require increasingly adaptive process strategies that take the inherent variability of the living product into account. This can be achieved through a tight control over product",

            "text": "Abstract Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are commonly used biologic therapeutics with a wide variety of clinical applications. During the development process, manufacturers consider different production parameters to improve protein yield and achieve appropriate quality of the product. Synonymous gene recoding is one of such attributes that is often considered and implemented to enhance protein expression. However, it has to be used with caution, as it may lead to protein misfolding and ER stress, which complicates efforts to manufacture the desired mAb. To investigate how changing mRNA sequence composition under different protein production parameters might affect the quality of recombinantly produced mAbs, we performed a comprehensive and systematic study assessing impact of synonymous gene recoding (commonly referred to as codon optimization) strategies in the context of varied cell culture parameters on product quality, biochemical and functional characteristics. We report the impact of these parameters on mAb glycosylation profiles, charge variant profile, aggregation, fragmentation, and mAb functional response from combinations of different production parameters. These results uncovered a complex interplay of sequence composition and manufacturing parameters and emphasize the importance of assessing changes to key quality attributes when optimizing mAb manufacturing, including the use of synonymous gene recoding.",

The feasibility of using Raman spectroscopy as an in\u2010line product quality measuring tool has been recently demonstrated and promises to relieve this analytical bottleneck. Here, we resolve time\u2010consuming calibration process that requires fractionation and preparative experiments covering variations of product quality attributes (PQAs) by engineering an automation system capable of collecting Raman spectra on the order of hundreds of calibration points from two to three stock seed solutions differing in protein concentration and aggregate level using controlled mixing. We used this automated system to calibrate multi\u2010PQA models that accurately measured product concentration and aggregation every 9.3\u2009s using an in\u2010line flow\u2010cell. We demonstrate the application of a nonlinear calibration model for monitoring product quality in real\u2010time during a biopharmaceutical purification process intended for clinical and commercial manufacturing. These results demonstrate potential feasibility to implement quality monitoring during GGMP manufacturing as well as to increase chemistry, manufacturing, and controls understanding during process development, ultimately leading to more robust and controlled manufacturing processes.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become the main products of biopharmaceutical industries throughout the past decades. Despite their typically low growth rate, unstable productivity and high process costs, mammalian cells benefit from their ability to perform human-like posttranslational modifications and thus represent the main expression system for mAb production [1][2][3]. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most commonly used cell systems for mammalian processes. Since GMP certificated processes are readily available and high throughput cell screening and fed-batch processing are established and well understood CHO cells will remain the main expression system in the near future [3][4][5]. Advanced understanding of CHO cell metabolism and interaction with process parameters is of high importance for process optimization, scale-up; and moreover, is a major requirement of quality by design (QbD) guidelines as claimed by the Federal Drug Association (FDA) [6]. Furthermore, modeling approaches as hybrid models may benefit from the knowledge of process parameter interactions and single effects to improve model fit and model quality [7]. Understanding of process parameter interactions is especially useful during process scale-up, where unwanted variations of pH, dissolved oxygen tension (pO 2 ) and carbon dioxide tension (pCO 2 ) are most likely to occur [8][9][10]. Manufacturing processes aim towards high product titers and space-time-yields but, moreover, good and consistent final product quality is of upmost importance. Monoclonal antibodies are very complex molecules and can be modified during up-and downstream process thus leading to heterogeneous final products [11]. Product heterogeneity may lead to various changes in physiochemical, biological and immunogenic properties compared to the desired homogeneous antibody drug. In more detail, protein heterogeneity may lead to different protein binding, stability, immune responses and pharmacokinetics [12]. Therefore, control of product heterogeneity within predefined analytical specifications is of high importance for cGMP manufacturing.",

However, the cost of many mAbs is still prohibitive (>$50,000 per patient per year), significantly limiting the accessibility of these life-saving therapeutics (Hernandez et al., 2018). \n\nRecently, several regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, have encouraged the adoption of continuous bioprocessing as a way to reduce costs and improve manufacturing flexibility and product quality (Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015;Pollock et al., 2017;Zydney, 2016). The use of perfusion bioreactors for continuous production of biological products is well-established; Hernandez (2015) noted that approximately 19 marketed recombinant proteins/mAbs were produced using perfusion systems at the time of that assessment. However, the industry continues to rely predominantly on fed-batch processes (Bielser et al., 2018), and the integration with continuous downstream processing has been more challenging. \n\nThe large increase in mAb titers that has been achieved in upstream processes over the past decade (Shukla et al., 2017) has generated renewed interest in using targeted precipitation as a lowcost alternative for mAb purification (Hammerschmidt et al., 2014;Pons Royo et al., 2023). Several recent studies have demonstrated the robustness and stability of mAb precipitation from clarified cell culture fluids (CCF) in a tubular flow precipitation reactor (Burgstaller et al., 2019;Dutra et al., 2020;Hammerschmidt et al., 2014Hammerschmidt et al., , 2016;;Li et al., 2019;Pons Royo et al., 2023).

            "text": "Development of Remicade's manufacturing process began as soon as the cA2 antibody was selected for development in 1992 [7], a full 6 years prior to the first FDA approval. This time was needed to develop and refine the process, and then validate through repeated production and testing that the final process could yield product consistently. Clinical development followed a parallel path during this time, with progression to later trial phases occurring alongside the maturation of the manufacturing process, as required by regulators.\n\nSeveral steps were necessary for development of the manufacturing process:\n\n\u2022 Meticulous planning and design of the facility, the utility/ engineering systems, the equipment, the critical processing areas, and validation of the same. \u2022 Identification and validation of the conditions under which the cell line and the biologic are best maintained and processed. \u2022 Identification of the parameters which are key to measuring process performance and product quality attributes which are key to safety, efficacy and consistency. \u2022 Definition of the limits (\"specifications\") of acceptable variability for each target parameter/attribute. \u2022 An understanding of how the variability of each parameter/attribute can be measured and controlled. \u2022 A quality control system which ensures that each batch of product meets the specifications set for each parameter/ attribute. \u2022 Strategic supplier relationships which monitor key incoming materials continuously to ensure their quality and consistent supply.\n\nOnce finalized, the manufacturing facility, the process, the identified parameters and their specifications must be approved by regulators as a condition of marketing approval [8] and are then locked into place. Commercial product and product used for subsequent clinical development are sourced from this approved process. Combined with the cell line, the approved manufacturing process and the testing specifications, which are both proprietary to Janssen and largely confidential, can be viewed conceptually as the definition of Remicade.\n\nTo understand further how Janssen controls variability in the manufacturing of Remicade, an overview of the process is helpful. It typically takes 9 months to manufacture each batch, and when combined with the time to acquire and release raw materials, the process can take up to 18 months. The process encompasses seven major phases ( Fig. 1), each consisting of dozens of steps and each of which is a source of potential product variability:\n\n\u2022 Procurement of raw materials and disposables. \u2022 WCB. \u2022 Production cell culture (fermentation). \u2022 Purification and bulk release. \u2022 Vial",

            "text": "For the monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA platform, in the best-case study scenario for every kilogram that is produced in the upstream line, only 600-700 g are obtained in the required by the regulatory agencies' purity. This means that raw and side materials must be purchased at high quantities and handled by expert personnel to reach the required production capacity, whilst in any case valuable cellular product will still remain underutilized and ultimately discarded. On the other hand, IVT mRNA manufacturing protocols hold strong competitive advantages related to certain manufacturing characteristics. Even though the mRNA vaccine itself is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, the production process is easier to standardize, automate, adapt and operate in continuous mode due to the synthetic chemical nature of its sub-processes. Regarding the biochemical section of the related processes, i.e., the utilization of prokaryotic cultures as cell factories, offers a less complex, more effective alternative that poses minimal requirements of retaining sterility compared to eukaryotics, thus reducing significantly the risks of cross contamination and the respective quality-related batch rejections, leading to overall higher yields and less product losses. This, in turn, lowers raw material processing resources and reduces product development time contributing to the delivery of products readily distributed to broad markets. \n\nThe studied production cases emancipate different levels of investment risk. The utilization of our Pareto norm enabled the quantification of this risk by recruiting the discount rate of the investment as the lead decision parameter. The optimal value of the discount rate for the IVT mRNA production, according to the Pareto norm, equals to 0.110, while for the rest equals to 0.103. \n\nAccording to the simulation results, recombinant DNA manufacturing demonstrates superior profitability indeces in comparison to IVT mRNA manufacturing for equal number of produced doses. The IVT mRNA vaccine manufacturing approach poses increased raw material requirements due to its intricate processes, i.e. linearization and in vitro transcription. \n\nIn the case of monoclonal antibodies produced by recombinant DNA technology, superior economic performance is showcased, with a MSPD of 130 \u20ac, lower compared to the IVT-mRNA vaccine bearing a price value of 365 \u20ac per dose.",

These magic bullets target biological molecules with crucial role in severe and chronic diseases such as cancer, autoimmune, cardiovascular, respiratory, hematology, and infectious diseases [2]. They have incredible therapeutic and commercial value which make them among the top 10 best sellers of pharmaceuticals for several past years [1]. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines are the mostly used mammalian host for mAb production. These cell lines are well characterized and experienced by many manufacturers, so the knowledge about their production behavior from high expression capability to desirable post translational modifications made them almost irreplaceable by alternative cell lines [3]. The complexity of mAb with about 150 kDa molecular weight make the implementation of quality by design (QbD) as an unavoidable strategy for development and manufacturing of these molecules [4]. QbD defines the critical quality attributes and a control strategy to assure the stable and consistent quality during the manufacturing process. Different post translational modifications during upstream process such as amino or carboxy terminal processing and glycosylation or during downstream processes or storage, such as deamidation, oxidation and fragmentation will end to different variants which could affect the safety, quality and efficacy of mAbs [5].Therefore, characterization and quantification of mAbs charge variants are required for assessing a consistent product quality [6].",

A variety of downstream processing technological advances have led to a paradigm shift in how therapeutic antibodies are developed and manufactured. A key driver of change has been the increased adoption of single-use technologies for process development and manufacturing. An early-stage developability assessment of potential lead antibodies, using both in silico and high-throughput experimental approaches, is critical to de-risk development and identify molecules amenable to manufacturing. Both statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches are being increasingly applied to downstream process development, allowing for deeper process understanding of chromatographic unit operations. Given the greater adoption of perfusion processes for antibody production, continuous and semi-continuous downstream processes are being increasingly explored as alternatives to batch processes. As part of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm, ever more sophisticated process analytical technologies play a key role in understanding antibody product quality in real-time. We should expect that computational prediction and modelling approaches will continue to be advanced and exploited, given the increasing sophistication and robustness of predictive methods compared to the costs, time, and resources required for experimental studies.",

Over the years, mAbs have gained significance as essential elements in various clinical diagnostic tests, and have been used in the treatment of diverse diseases including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infections [3], [4], [5]. \n\nWith its vital role in the pharmaceutical industry, the market size of mAbs is projected to reach an impressive $138.6 billion by 2024 [6]. However, the high annual cost of mAb treatments poses a significant challenge, as it can amount to approximately $35,000 per patient [2]. This cost is attributed to the required high doses and the expensive production process. Consequently, optimizing its production is imperative. \n\nThe majority of steps in mAb manufacturing rely on batch operations, such as batch/fed-batch culture and chromatography purification. Due to the increasing pressure to drive down cost, there is a growing interest in a transition towards a fully-continuous production process. This transition offers potential advantages, including enhanced product quality, quantity, and stability, as well as the elimination of expenses associated with storing intermediate products. In comparison, batch operations suffer from various drawbacks such as lower efficiency, higher costs, challenges in scaling up, and compromised product quality [7]. \n\nSeveral studies have explored the continuous manufacturing of mAbs [6], [8], [9]. The continuous production process can be divided into two main components: the upstream process and the downstream process. In the upstream process, a perfusion bioreactor is utilized to continuously supply nutrients for cell nourishment. In a study by Papathanasiou et al. [10], a GS-NS0 cell culture system was considered for mAb production within the bioreactor. To maintain a high cell density, a cell retention device is typically incorporated to recycle cells from the effluent stream of the bioreactor. The remaining contents are directed downstream for product purification through a number of chromatography steps. \n\nTo maintain continuous flow, the first step of the downstream process usually employs two or more chromatography columns.",

            "text": "During the transition from academic to industrial manufacturing for use in global clinical trials, several steps were taken to improve process performance and robustness while maintaining the quality of the tisagenlecleucel product (Table 1). Some of the key process changes included enhancement of process control to ensure consistency, replacement of manual processes with automation to ensure reproducibility, validation of analytical methods to increase consistency, and use of closed systems to prevent contamination. Increased understanding of analytical method performance by method validation and implementation of more robust and/or faster methods were areas of focus during technology transfer and scaleout. A new quantitation method for CAR protein expression using an anti-idiotypic antibody improved the robustness and linear range of the assay used for dose determination. Optimization of the vector used for the CAR-T cell transduction step helped to reduce variability, maximize transduction efficiency, and allow for scaling out of the manufacturing process. The lentiviral vector manufacturing process was also improved to allow for large-scale vector production in good manufacturing practice (GMP) settings. 2 mparability of process performance and product quality during the technical transfer was established through the assessment of selected parameters such as cellular growth rate, cell size, potency, viability, and removal of vector residuals (Figure 3A). Equivalency testing was carried out for each CQA to demonstrate analytical comparability (Figure 3B). The equivalence acceptance criteria setting are dependent on manufacturing process understanding, and can be based on the variability in the method and/or process. \n\nCryopreserved leukapheresis was selected as the preferred starting material over fresh material to meet the demands of centralized manufacturing for a global trial while allowing for maximal flexibility in patient management. Cryopreserved leukapheresis allows for extended storage of starting material in the event of manufacturing delays, allows for reliable and consistent manufacturing, and, most importantly, provides flexibility for patients to undergo leukapheresis at a time when it is most convenient and appropriate for the patient, as opposed to aligning with manufacturing slot availability.",

            "text": "In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the development of biopharmaceutical drugs as a response to the increased cost of conventional drug development, patent expiration, and market erosion through generic drugs. This has resulted in a rapid growth of the biopharmaceutical market, which recently assesses over 7000 drugs on development and more than 450 billion $ annual sales. Among the biopharmaceutical products, recombinant proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are the highest selling class with more than 1500 drugs in the development pipeline (Hong et al., 2018). \n\nMonoclonal antibodies are an important class of therapeutic molecules used to treat immunological and oncological diseases in humans. Mammalian cell cultures, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, represent nowadays the preferred choice for mAbs production, since they guarantee enzymatic post-translational modification, such as glycosylation, which are essential for the activity and safety of mAbs (Karst et al., 2017). The successful development of a mAb, as well as of any other biopharmaceutical product, is a resource intensive, time consuming and multiple step process (Li et al., 2010). For these reasons, a major challenge in biopharmaceuticals development is the rapid development of a robust and scalable process, which allows accelerating the progress of several mAbs into clinical trials. Thus, biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking at innovative solutions to reduce the drug time to market while maintaining the desired quality attributes in order to improve the economics of drug development (Rameez et al., 2014). \n\nThe development pipeline of cell culture process for mAbs production typically begins selecting the best cell lines in small scale systems (e.g.: nanofluidic and optoelecto positioning systems, microwell plates, and shake flasks), which allow high throughput experiments. However, these systems lack the control of some important process parameters, such as agitation rate, dissolved oxygen, and pH.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently the highestselling products of the biopharmaceutical industry, having had global sales of over $45 billion in 2012 [1]. All commercially-available mAbs contain a consensus N-linked glycosylation site on each of the C\u03b32 domains of their constant fragment (Fc). The monosaccharide composition and distribution of these N-linked carbohydrates (glycans) has been widely reported to directly impact the safety and efficacy of mAbs when administered to patients. Many studies have also shown that manufacturing bioprocess conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, metabolite accumulation, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and stirring speed) directly influence the composition and distribution of N-linked glycans bound to mAbs and other recombinant proteins. Given this tight interconnection between manufacturing process conditions, product quality and ensuing safety and therapeutic efficacy, mAbs and their glycosylation present a clear opportunity where process development can be guided by quality by design (QbD) principles. \n\nQbD is a conceptual framework that aims to build quality into drug products at every stage of process development. Specifically, implementation of QbD to pharmaceutical process development requires identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) that define the drug's safety and therapeutic efficacy. QbD then uses all available information on the mechanisms that quantitatively relate process inputs with product quality to control the manufacturing process so that product CQAs are maintained and end-product quality is ensured. Within the QbD context, composition and distribution of the glycans present on the Fc of mAbs is defined as a CQA, and thus, the processes employed in their manufacture must be controlled so that their glycan distribution ensures the required safety and efficacy profiles. Under this perspective, we have defined a mathematical model that mechanistically and quantitatively describes mAb Fc glycosylation as a function of nutrient availability during cell culture. Such a model aims to be used for bioprocess design, control and optimisation, thus facilitating the manufacture of mAbs with built-in glycosylation-associated quality under the QbD scope.",

The rapid growth in product demand for mAbs triggered parallel efforts to increase production capacity through construction of large bulk manufacturing plants as well as improvements in cell culture processes to raise product titers. This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels. The reduction of capacity and cost pressures for current state-of-the-art bulk production processes may shift the focus of process development efforts and have important implications for both plant design and product development strategies for both biopharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT N-linked glycosylation is a primary source of heterogeneity associated with recombinant monoclonal antibodies and plays a key role in a myriad of drug properties associated with biological function. The glycosylation profile of recombinant monoclonal antibodies is influenced by an array of cell culture inputs which must be carefully controlled in order to engineer the desired glycan distribution. A platform reduced intact mass method applied to monoclonal antibodies has been validated as a quantitative method to monitor the relative mannose-5 level as a surrogate for overall high mannose content in cell culture as a control strategy to ensure product quality and process consistency. The method was shown to be linear, accurate, specific, and precise for an IgG1 and IgG4 mAb allowing relative quantitation of mannose-5 in the range 0.8\u201311.0% and 1.0\u20136.2%, respectively. The method can be applied at several stages of the production process from cell culture harvest to drug substance/drug product and is amenable to routine GMP batch testing in a quality control laboratory. Testing upstream during cell culture rather than for product release allows for an earlier assessment of product quality as the glycosylation profile remains unchanged during downstream purification.

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently the highest-selling products of the biopharmaceutical industry, having had global sales of over $45 billion in 2012 [1]. All commercially-available mAbs contain a consensus N-linked glycosylation site on each of the C\u03b32 domains of their constant fragment (Fc). The monosaccharide composition and distribution of these N-linked carbohydrates (glycans) has been widely reported to directly impact the safety and efficacy of mAbs when administered to patients. Many studies have also shown that manufacturing bioprocess conditions (e.g. nutrient availability, metabolite accumulation, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and stirring speed) directly influence the composition and distribution of N-linked glycans bound to mAbs and other recombinant proteins. Given this tight interconnection between manufacturing process conditions, product quality and ensuing safety and therapeutic efficacy, mAbs and their glycosylation present a clear opportunity where process development can be guided by quality by design (QbD) principles. \n \nQbD is a conceptual framework that aims to build quality into drug products at every stage of process development. Specifically, implementation of QbD to pharmaceutical process development requires identifying critical quality attributes (CQAs) that define the drug's safety and therapeutic efficacy. QbD then uses all available information on the mechanisms that quantitatively relate process inputs with product quality to control the manufacturing process so that product CQAs are maintained and end-product quality is ensured. Within the QbD context, composition and distribution of the glycans present on the Fc of mAbs is defined as a CQA, and thus, the processes employed in their manufacture must be controlled so that their glycan distribution ensures the required safety and efficacy profiles. Under this perspective, we have defined a mathematical model that mechanistically and quantitatively describes mAb Fc glycosylation as a function of nutrient availability during cell culture. Such a model aims to be used for bioprocess design, control and optimisation, thus facilitating the manufacture of mAbs with built-in glycosylation-associated quality under the QbD scope.",

            "text": "The monoclonal antibody (mAb) market has grown exponentially since the first mAb was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986. 1 Since then, monoclonal antibodies have become a dominant presence in the biopharmaceutical market, making up 53% of the 122 new product approvals from 2014 to 2018, a nearly 100% increase over the previous 4 year period. 2 Additionally, the global monoclonal antibody market valuation is ballooning rapidly, with an increase from $115.2 billion in 2018 to an expected $300 billion by 2025. 1 As the commercial pipeline of these proteins expands, a large challenge manufacturers face is dramatically reducing the cost of goods (CoGs) to remain competitive in the growing manufacturing space while also promoting democratization of therapies through reduction of cost to the customer. One effective method to reduce CoGs for biotherapeutics manufacturing is increasing the productivity in the production bioreactor, which increases total product yield without an increase in bioreactor resources. \n\nAdvances in antibody production technologies have made giant strides over the last few decades. In 1985, average fed-batch titers were approximately 0.20 g/L, which since then have grown over 1600%, achieving projected average fed-batch titers of 3.20 g/L. 3 However, some literature sources have reported fed-batch titers as high as 10 g/L in 14-18 day processes, indicating that the pace of fed-batch productivity advancements is picking up speed. 4,5 These rising yields can be attributed to incremental advances in cell line engineering, 6 improved process control, 4 and advanced media development within the biopharmaceutical industry. 7 Although reported yields are steadily growing, with the mAb market greatly expanding, the appetite for further bioreactor productivity advancements is higher than ever. To meet this demand, a paradigm shift toward intensified processing is required to make these substantial productivity gains rather than relying on the incremental technological step changes of the past. \n\nOne appealing and highly productive platform process that has gained momentum in recent years is the intensified or high inoculation density (HID) fed-batch bioreactor.",

            "text": "The global sales for biopharmaceuticals are constantly on the rise which is the major driving force for the optimization of industrial production processes (Walsh, 2014;Morrison and L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, 2017). Additionally, the growing number of expiring patent protections and the subsequent emergence of biosimilar producing companies and processes has increased the urge for optimized processes even further (Mullard, 2012;Gaughan, 2016). Especially the major biopharmaceutical product group of monoclonal antibodies and their main production host Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are in the focus of research (Ecker et al., 2015). As a result, product titers have increased substantially over the past years (Kunert and Reinhart, 2016) and process intensification toward continuous processes (Hammerschmidt et al., 2014) as well as an increased use of singleuse bioreactors (L\u00f6ffelholz et al., 2013) has taken place. But since fed-batch cultivation remains the predominant large-scale process in industry, a large number of studies focusing on fed-batch processes have been published over the past decades. An improved understanding of media and feeding was therefore already achieved (Birch and Racher, 2006;Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes, 2010). Despite the gathered knowledge many uncertainties remain, particularly during scale-up into industry relevant scales. Challenges occurring during scale-up can be inhomogeneities due to local accumulation of feed or base or merely poor mixing (Xu et al., 2018). Especially addition of titration agents like CO 2 or Na 2 CO 3 can lead to gradients and therefore inhibition of cellular growth and productivity (Xing et al., 2009;Sieblist et al., 2011). The result of these inhomogeneities can be gradients in pCO 2 or pH influencing the cellular metabolism and hence the productivity of the process (Langheinrich and Nienow, 1999;Osman et al., 2001;Xing et al., 2009). In contrast, a shift to lactate consumption by the cells is considered as beneficial and can even occur when glucose is present in excess, but is not yet fully understood (Mulukutla et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Stability and shelf life of formulated antibodies have been studied extensively but there is limited data available for process intermediates. Research is classically based on ideal storage conditions for final drug formulations [1][2][3] but nowadays biopharmaceutical operations are often conducted on a global scale and the materials might be shipped mid-manufacturing. In 2016, the European Medicine Agency (EMA) published a guideline on process validation for the manufacturing of biotechnology-derived products 4 where they recommend to evaluate the impact of hold steps, mid-manufacturing storage, and transportation on process intermediates. To determine the influence of unexpected process interruptions on the intermediate, they suggest to perform studies under worst-case and non-standard conditions. Furthermore, intermediate characterization is crucial for process development, design of hold steps, and development of in-process control methods. Therefore, protein alterations and stability at all stages during processing are important. \n\nStability studies are time and cost consuming, since the samples must be stored under the respective temperature and conditions for the projected time period to get good quality data. Accelerated shelflife studies have been suggested in which the sample is stored at higher temperature and then possible storage time at lower temperature is extrapolated using the Arrhenius equation. 5 For elaboration of shelf-life some quality parameters reflecting the degradation of the protein must be determined. \n\nAll proteins, including recombinant antibodies, are susceptible to alterations during production, processing, and storage. Common modifications of antibodies are sialylation, glycosylation, deamidation, oxidation, N-terminal pyroglutamine cyclization, C-terminal lysine cleavage, aspartate isomerization, and disulfide bond shuffling. 6 These modifications give rise to a high degree of microheterogeneity and can affect antibody functionality and stability. 7 It is not possible to capture all these variants therefore surrogate parameters are used during product and process development. Importance has however to be put on the identification of critical protein modifications in order to limit degradation pathways and define optimum storage conditions in regard of temperature, humidity, and light irradiation.",

            "text": "Currently there are more than 150 protein-based drugs approved by the FDA (1996) and EMA including \u223c35 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In addition, more than 900 medicines and vaccines are under clinical development, with 30 mAb candidates in late-stage trials (Aggarwal, 2012;Reichert, 2013). There has been a concomitant increase in demand for more production capacity to make larger amounts of protein drugs, challenging manufacturers to develop new technologies and to scale-up their manufacturing processes. The biopharmaceutical industry and government regulators need an efficient and scientifically based approach to evaluate the effect of process changes and production scale-up on the structural integrity, physicochemical identity and clinical safety and efficacy of protein drug candidates. This first led to the development of \"well characterized biotechnology products\" and \"comparability\" regulatory guidance documents in 1996. These general concepts of comparability were then further defined and expanded by additional guidances from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2003 (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products), the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) (Q5E) in 2003 (ICH Q5E, 2005) and by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 (Expert Committee on Biological Standardization, 2009). \n\nThe primary and higher order structures of protein drug molecules are delicate in nature, especially compared to small molecule drugs, and are highly sensitive to environmental changes and stresses in general. Changes in the manufacturing process for a protein therapeutic may occur during clinical development or after commercialization. These changes frequently occur in either the manufacturing steps of the active drug substance (e.g., facility, equipment or process changes) or in the finished drug product (e.g., formulation excipients, containerclosure system, dosage form changes) (Chirino and Mire-Sluis, 2004;Federici et al., 2013). The manufacturer may apply changes in their manufacturing processes for variety of reasons such as improving yields and purity, ensuring better patient convenience, or facilitating compliance with new regulations. Comparability studies are performed to assess the effect of these process and product changes on the \"critical quality attributes\" (CQAs) by comparing the pre and post-change protein products through a series of tests performed in a head-to-head fashion.",

            "text": "The monoclonal antibody market is growing rapidly, with expected total market revenues reaching a valuation of 300 billion US$ by 2025 [1,2]. Due to major advancements in the biopharmaceutical industry, the number of medical applications is quickly increasing, including treatments for cancer as well as novel diseases such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3][4][5][6]. The traditional approach for product and process development consists of a rigid manufacturing process with predefined set points and batch-to-batch quality controls, resulting in a lack of methodical connection between the process, product, and application. In order to enable fast approval and release to market of novel therapeutic antibodies fulfilling high-quality standards the development and production process has to be performed in a structured and controlled environment [7]. Following this agenda, the FDA introduced a guideline to biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing with the Current Good Manufacturing Practice for the 21st century initiative in 2004. This protocol includes the framework for Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and guidelines from the International Conference of Harmonisation, which introduced the concept of Quality by Design (QbD) as a risk-based approach to the development of new therapeutics [8][9][10][11][12]. This approach defined the main objective of research as a way to construct and methodically build quality into the process and product during the development phase instead of testing it into the product during production. Thereby biopharmaceutical manufacturers are able to tune their processes toward product quality in a compliant environment, resulting in improved flexibility, cost reduction, and faster adjustments in production as well as the development [13,14].\n\nQuality by Design is structured as a multi-step process, starting with the identification of process parameters and a risk assessment, followed by a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to examine critical process parameters (CPPs) regarding critical quality attributes (CQAs) [15,16]. CPPs are evaluated process inputs like the initial viable cell density or the culture pH, while CQAs include process and product outputs like the growth rate of the cells or the bioactivity of the produced antibody.

            "text": "Since the approval of the first licensed monoclonal antibody (mAb) in 1986, the demand for mAbs as therapeutic agents has developed into a multi-billion dollar per year market (Liu, 2014). Process optimization for large manufacturing facilities based on fed-batch cell cultivation allowed sufficient productivity of high product quality mAbs (Birch & Racher, 2006). On the other hand, continuous bioprocessing employing perfusion bioreactors is utilized in the production of molecules that proved to be challenging to express or recover. The low bioreactor residence times associated with continuous production systems, and the continuous removal of potentially toxic by-products, allows cells to reach high cell concentrations and improves total functional production. Currently, continuous production is widely accepted as beneficial for the manufacture of products such as infliximab (Remicade) that exhibited particularly low titres (B. Kelley, 2009), and haemoglobin factor VIII (ReFacto), which required minimal residence times in the bioreactor (Vogel et al., 2012). \n\nAs the demand for therapeutic mAb production increased, key improvements were made in the areas of safety, efficacy, and quality (Dimitrov, 2012), among which the utilization of scale down systems to investigate process robustness played an important role (Kochanowski & Malphettes, 2013). Automated single use microscale bioreactor systems were evaluated as a model for large scale fed-batch bioprocessing systems (Hsu, Aulakh, Traul, & Yuk, 2012;Moses, Manahan, Ambrogelly, & Ling, 2012;Nienow et al., 2013). Microscale bioreactors were reported to shorten the timeline towards commercial production by allowing multifactorial process optimization, in line with the current Quality by Design guidelines (FDA, 2008). pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) could be accurately controlled both in microscale and in large scale (Rameez, Mostafa, Miller, & Shukla, 2014). Informing process control at large scale involves an extensive understanding of the physical characteristics and limitations of the system investigated at microscale (Nienow et al., 2013).",

Since the first approval of a therapeutic mAb in 1986, mAbs and antibody-related products have become the most popular biotherapeutics for treatment of various diseases, including cancers, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory disorders. 1,2 The 'Antibodies to watch' article series has documented a more than 100% increase in the number of mAbs in Phase 3 clinical trials, from 26 mAbs in 2010 to 62 mAbs in 2019. 3 With 225 mAbs currently in Phase 2 trials, the number of therapeutic mAbs in the commercial pipeline is expected to continue increasing. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry is heavily invested in developing better manufacturing processes for mAb therapeutics to increase productivity while decreasing operating cost. 4,5 lthough mAbs are known for structural integrity and stability compared to other biotherapeutics, changes in bioreactor growth conditions can lead to changes in critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the mAb. To control the quality of the product, many analytical tools, including liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), UV-Vis spectroscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry (MS), are used in the development and manufacturing of these molecules. Among these tools, LC is the most widely used for determining CQAs such as titer, aggregation, charge heterogeneity, oxidation, glycosylation, hydrophobicity, and protein affinity. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is the most frequently used LC technique during process development for analysis of mAb aggregates; this is an important CQA because aggregates are known to affect biological potency, protein stability, and safety. 6,7 ne challenge for LC-based methods, such as SEC, is that impurities in the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) can interfere with the analysis of the target mAb. Thus, the mAb must first be separated from the cells and then purified prior to analysis by SEC. 8",

However, with limited manufacturing experience and under traditional process validation approaches (with the use of a limited number of product consistency lots) and end product quality control systems, manufacturing processes are often poorly specified and locked in to narrow specification criteria at the time of approval. In this context, experts referred to the impact of input variability associated with donor-derived starting material and the ethical concerns surrounding the acquisition of the multiple product cell lots that are required for such traditional process validation studies (eg, are repeated procedures for draining patient bone marrow for use in validation studies ethically justifiable?). \n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, it was perceived that the tests and analytical procedures chosen to define the product specifications under a traditional end-product testingebased product release regime generally would not be considered adequate to assess the impact of manufacturing process changes or site transfer. Typically, these specifications are chosen to confirm the routine quality of the product (eg, sterility, identity) rather than to fully characterize it. \n\nA manufacturing process change is likely to require a complete or limited repetition of the characterization activity that was conducted for the market authorization application (25). Despite the expectation that the level of characterization required by the regulator may be reduced with the addition of subsequent manufacturing sites beyond a certain threshold (eg, n > 6), experts agreed that this level of testing would still present significant practical challenges in the autologous setting for the reasons already described. \n\nThe perspective of two panelists was that completion of process validation studies should be sufficient for regulatory approval of additional manufacturing sites, referring to analogous approaches for bone marrow transplantation and the preparation and production of radiopharmaceuticals in positron emission tomography centers. The challenge for autologous cell therapy manufacturers, however, is in how to apply process validation to a manufactured lot of patient cells when that same lot is intended for treatment of the patient. \n\nNew concepts within the process validation guidance (27,28), which put forward continuous process verification as a more progressive and graded approach, afford manufacturers with new possibilities.",

They acquired measurements at 12 different (time) points across each run for a total of 444 data points to construct their Raman model. This kind of study is not only time-consuming but is also very expensive, particularly at larger scales (media costs alone are around \u20ac100,000 for a 2000 L run). Furthermore, executing model building runs in production environments is almost impossible, as induced process variations would require the batch to be discarded due to suboptimal quality attributes for the end biological product. Therefore, a robust Raman model is currently achieved by monitoring dozens of production runs and arbitrary (smaller) variations of in-specification batches, with considerable value being introduced when unfortunate out-of-specification events occur during routine manufacturing. \n\nUtilizing a small-scale bioreactor setup enables the use of sound experimental design methodologies to induce variations at acceptable costs, while one run consisting of twentyfour bioreactors yields a larger and more robust design space compared to many more large-scale production batches, consisting of only arbitrary variations. If this model can be transferred to larger scales (e.g., by adding a few points from larger scales), the robustness of the low effort small-scale bioreactor model is made available for applications across all scales. \n\nThis study describes the implementation of a prototype Raman flow cell in a 250 mL mini bioreactor system, ultimately paving the way to monitor and control key process and product attributes during small-scale cell culture manufacture.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibody (mAb) product development has had great success with over 80 mAbs granted marketing approvals, while the commercial pipeline is robust with over 570 mAbs in different clinical development stages (Ecker et al. 2015;Kaplon and Reichert 2019;Walsh 2018). Global annual sales of mAbs were above $115 billion in 2018 and are predicted to rise above $300 billion in 2025 (Lu et al. 2020). These great achievements are partially due to the higher approval success rates for mAbs than small molecule drug products (Hay et al. 2014;Kaplon and Reichert 2019). Although great progress has been made in mAb process development, the manufacturing cost remains much higher for mAbs than small molecules. In order to reach more patients, reduce supply shortages and compete with biosimilars, reducing mAb manufacturing costs (e.g. by increasing cell culture titer, while maintaining desired quality) remains a major challenge (Du et al. 2019;Kunert and Reinhart 2016;Xu et al. 2018). \n\nCurrent fed-batch mAb manufacturing platforms are durable and robust and have not yet fully matured (Bielser et al. 2018;Croughan et al. 2015;Kelley et al. 2018;Yongky et al. 2019). From the 1980s to the 2010s, manufacturing titers improved from tens of mg/L to \u2265 3 g/L by cell line engineering (Lin et al. 2019;Wurm 2013), media development (Galbraith et al. 2018;Huang et al. 2010;Xu et al. 2018), and process control improvements (Tang et al. 2020;Xu et al. 2019;Yoon et al. 2003) achieving higher cell specific productivities, increased peak VCDs, and prolonged high productivity durations (Kunert and Reinhart 2016;Li et al. 2010;Rader and Langer 2015;Wurm 2004). Higher titers continue to be reported in recent literature (e.g. 9-10 g/L titer in 14-18 days) (Handlogten et al. 2018;Huang et al. 2010;Takagi et al. 2017), suggesting that potential remains for further increases in productivity and reduction in cost using fed-batch operation.",

Both process types comprise opposing advantages and disadvantages in areas such as plant utilization, feasible cell densities, media consumption and process monitoring effort. In this study, we show feasibility of a promising novel hybrid process strategy that combines beneficial attributes of both process formats. In detail, our strategy comprises a short duration FB, followed by a fast media exchange and cell density readjustment, marking the start of the next FB cycle. Utilizing a small-scale screening tool, we were able to identify beneficial process parameters, including FB interval duration and reinoculation cell density, that allow for multiple cycles of the outlined process in a reproducible manner. In addition, we could demonstrate scalability of the process to a 5L benchtop system, using a fluidized-bed centrifuge as scalable media exchange system. The novel process showed increased productivity (+217%) as well as longer cultivation duration, in comparison to a standard FB with a significantly lower media consumption per produced product (\u221250%) and a decreased need for process monitoring, in comparison to a perfusion cultivation. Further, the process revealed constant glycosylation pattern in comparison to the perfusion cultivation and has strong potential for further scale-up, due to the use of fully scalable cultivation and media exchange platforms. In summary, we have developed a novel hybrid process strategy that tackles the key challenges of current biomanufacturing of either low productivity or high media consumption, representing a new and innovative approach for future process intensification efforts.",

            "text": "Recombinantly produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as well as biosimilars, are key products in today's pharmaceutical industry [1,2]. Post-translational product modifications induced by chemical and enzymatical intra-and extracellular mechanisms during the production process lead to micro-heterogeneity of mAbs, in turn affecting product characteristics (e.g., efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics) [3]. The recombinant cell line, the culture media and the process settings affect these quality attributes [4,5]. During process development, it is important to ensure a reproducible, distinct and preferably homogenous pattern of the product. For the establishment of biosimilars, it is important to match the characteristics of the originator product [6]. The effects of various extra-and intracellular influences on different aspects of product quality have been evaluated in great detail. For instance, N-glycosylation is by far the best-studied quality attribute and there are several strategies available for glycosylation control [7].\n\nOne additional important measure of mAb heterogeneity is the distribution of surface charge variants. Due to numerous modifications, the net surface charge of mAbs can be altered [8][9][10][11]. Charge species with a lower isoelectric point (pI) than the main fraction of the product are defined as acidic variants and generated by sialylation, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, glycation and other mechanisms. Glycation, for instance, is a non-enzymatic reaction where a reducing sugar molecule, most commonly glucose, is covalently bound to a reactive amino group [12]. Basic variants are defined as species with a higher pI than the main fraction and generated by incomplete C-terminal lysine clipping of the heavy chains, as well as by fragmentation and aggregation [13]. Several studies indicate that mAb variants can lead to varying biological responses [14][15][16]. For instance, it was shown that the basic variants exhibited an increased binding to the FC and the neonatal receptor, indicating an increased half-life [15]. Another",

Manufacturing a mAb at scale relies on cost-effective and robust approaches to derisk manufacturability parameters, such as viscosity, conformational stability, aggregation, and process-related impurities. Using a panel of model anti-IL-8 IgG1 mutants, we investigate upstream and downstream processability, phase behavior, and process-related impurities. We correlate trends in the biophysical properties of mAbs with their cell growth, expression, filtration flux, solubility, and post-translational modifications. We find significant trends in increased relative free light chain expression with heavy chain mutants and detect a requirement for adjusted operation pH for cation exchange polishing steps with charge-altering variants. Moreover, trends between phase stability and high-concentration viscosity were observed. We also investigated unique correlations between increased glycosylation and biophysical behavior. Further in-depth analysis and modeling are required to elucidate the impact of the mAb sequence on the metabolism of the expression system, solubility limits, and alternative gelation models as future directions.",

These modifications may impact (or not) the stability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of mAbs. The presence of the same type of modifications as found in endogenous immunoglobulin G (IgG) can substantially lower the safety risks of mAbs.

            "text": "Posttranslational modification is a central mechanism for the regulation of mammalian protein function. In particular, N-linked glycosylation can profoundly influence biochemical and physiological properties of antibodies. The bio-manufacturing industry has used mammalian expression systems, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or NS0 cells, for the production of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics to recreate human-like posttranslational glycosylation patterns, 1 but the complexities of controlling glycan structures continue to pose substantial challenges, including the selection of an appropriate glycosylation product quality profile suitable for a given pharmaceutical antibody. In particular, maintaining a consistent product quality profile across cell age, between different master or working cell banks, and when producing mAbs in different types of vessels, at different manufacturing sites, or at different scales remains challenging. Such difficulties may occur during process transfers, scale-up or scale-out, or after changes in raw material sourcing, in particular when executing against aggressive timelines, and they underscore the importance of maintaining consistent product quality over the entire product lifecycle. In order to enable agile implementation of process changes at later developmental stages, it is crucial to build a solid understanding of the underlying design space and its limitations. Importantly, such an adaptable platform for glycan product quality modulation should be effectively implemented early in development. Analogous considerations apply for the growing field of biosimilar development, where the product quality of a reference medicinal product must be matched within tight specification limits. \n\nAntibody N-linked glycosylation encompasses a multi-step biochemical process in different compartments of the secretory pathway, resulting in a varied population of predominantly biantennary glycoforms in the final product pool. 1,2 his is particularly important because different glycoforms have been demonstrated to mediate effector functions, influence circulatory half-life, or elicit immunogenicity, all of which can affect drug efficacy or patient safety. 3][14] Therefore, the product quality profile should be defined and maintained early on.",

The establishment of robust manufacturing platforms are key for antibody drug discovery efforts to seamlessly translate into clinical and commercial successes. Several drivers are influencing the design of mAb manufacturing processes. The advent of biosimilars is driving a desire to achieve lower cost of goods and globalize biologics manufacturing. High titers are now routinely achieved for mAbs in mammalian cell culture. These drivers have resulted in significant evolution in process platform approaches. Additionally, several new trends in bioprocessing have arisen in keeping with these needs. These include the consideration of alternative expression systems, continuous biomanufacturing and non\u2010chromatographic separation formats. This paper discusses these drivers in the context of the kinds of changes they are driving in mAb production processes.",

            "text": "Successful control of biopharmaceutical manufacturing is critical for ensuring product quality and lot-to-lot consistency of therapeutic proteins. Although some amount of heterogeneity can be expected because of the complexity of large molecules, rigorous testing and characterization are used to define product consistency throughout process development. Product appearance, i.e., the state and color of a product, is a required specification for release and can be a simple test to identify product or process impurities. 1 Although color may not affect safety or efficacy, even moderate color variation in a therapeutic product can indicate process inconsistency and possibly present complications for blinding studies during clinical trials. \n\nAlthough proteins commonly have some color due to light scattering at high concentrations, variability in color observed during manufacturing may be from process-related impurities. 2,3 ell culture media is a common source of colored components in biotherapeutic manufacturing, but these are normally cleared during downstream processing. 4 Host cell proteins, however, have been observed to co-purify due to protein interactions. 5 imilarly, vitamins in cell culture media have shown high affinity Process control of protein therapeutic manufacturing is central to ensuring the product is both safe and efficacious for patients. In this work, we investigate the cause of pink color variability in development lots of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and Fc-fusion proteins. Results show pink-colored product generated during manufacturing is due to association of hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl), a form of vitamin B 12 . OH-Cbl is not part of the product manufacturing process; however we found cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) in cell culture media converts to OH-Cbl in the presence of light. OH-Cbl can be released from mAb and Fc-fusion proteins by conversion with potassium cyanide to CN-Cbl, which does not bind. By exploiting the differential binding of CN-Cbl and OH-Cbl, we developed a rapid and specific assay to accurately measure B 12 levels in purified protein. Analysis of multiple products and lots using this technique gives insight into color variability during manufacturing. \n\nto monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may co-purify, resulting in a colored final product. 6,7",

            "text": "Mammalian cell cultures such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for the commercial production of therapeutic biomolecules like monoclonal antibodies and proteins 1 . Several process parameters like pH, temperature, pO2, CO2, air flow, feeding, agitation rate etc. are essential to maintain cells in a culture environment 2 . Temperature and pH being one of the critical parameters requires optimization for enhanced cell growth, viability, productivity for the generation of therapeutic biomolecules. The optimization of fed-batch culture for the production of monoclonal antibodies with desired quantity with desired quality is a challenging process and usually it depends on particular biotherapeutic molecule as well 3 . Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgGlK monoclonal antibody with a molecular weight of approximately 149 kD that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin (IgE). Omalizumab inhibits the interaction of IgE with high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) 4 . \n\nAcidic species or acidic variants produced during the production process are defined as the antibody variants that elute earlier than the main peak during CEX or later than the main peak during AEX analysis. Sialic acid or deamidation has been commonly reported to contribute to the formation of acidic species. These charge variants substantially affect the in vitro and in vivo properties of antibodies 5 . Galactose a unit for the glycosylation chain reaction by linking it next to a Nacetylglucosamine sugar via galactosyltransferase 6 . Galactosylation is known to affect the process of complement dependent (CDC), as the highest modes of action (MOA) of monoclonal antibodies.

            "text": "The optimization of production costs remains a critical challenge in mAb manufacturing, requiring a multifaceted approach encompassing media development, process integration, and strategic technology selection. 21 Recent advances in these areas have demonstrated significant potential in cost reduction while maintaining or improving product quality. \n\nMedia optimization represents a fundamental strategy for cost reduction, with particular emphasis on chemically defined feed media development. Kishishita et al 22 identified key amino acids (serine, cysteine, and tyrosine) that significantly improved mAb production when added to feed media. The development of novel tripeptide delivery methods has shown promise in improving amino acid solubility and delivery, resulting in up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Furthermore, strategic supplementation approaches have demonstrated success in reducing lactate accumulation and enhancing cell viability through optimized media composition. \n\nProcess integration has emerged as a crucial factor in cost optimization, focusing on the harmonization of upstream and downstream operations. Studies indicate that improved integration between these processes can significantly reduce overall manufacturing costs while enhancing product quality. Equipment utilization plays a vital role in this context, with research showing that optimized scheduling and facility design can improve productivity by 20%-30%. 8 Facility design 23,24 considerations must balance multiple factors, including: \n\n\u2022 Clean room requirements \u2022 Material flow optimization \u2022 Equipment placement efficiency \u2022 Utility systems integration Technology selection represents the third pillar of cost optimization, with scale-dependent considerations playing a crucial role in decision-making. Research demonstrates that single-use systems offer significant advantages at smaller scales (100-500 kg annual production), whereas traditional stainless steel systems may be more economical at larger scales. The cost-benefit analysis must include multiple factors: \n\n\u2022 Initial capital investment \u2022 Operational costs \u2022 Maintenance requirements \u2022 Production flexibility \u2022 Environmental impact Recent studies have shown that hybrid approaches, combining both single-use and traditional systems, can offer optimal solutions for many manufacturers. According to Sinclair and Monge, 17 hybrid facilities demonstrate faster breakeven points, typically achieving profitability 2-2.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. This advantage stems from lower upfront capital costs and improved cash flow profiles, though careful consideration must be given to increased consumable costs. \n\nThe successful implementation of these optimization strategies requires careful consideration of facility-specific factors and product requirements.",

            "text": "Bioprocessing technology for production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has advanced greatly since their introduction into the market in 1986. Early murine mAbs were derived from hybridoma cell lines, using diverse production technology; the first licensed mAb therapeutic, OKT3, was produced in the ascites of mice. 1 The development of recombinant technology based on cloning and expression of the heavy and light chain antibody genes in CHO cells enabled mAb production to take advantage of the common technologies already used for recombinant products like tissue plasminogen activator, erythropoietin, Factor VIII, etc. These recombinant cell culture processes for antibody production initially had low expression levels, with titers typically well below 1 g/L. 2 The combination of low titers and large market demands for some of the first recombinant mAbs like rituximab (Rituxan), trastuzumab (Herceptin), infliximab (Remicade) and others drove many companies and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to build large production plants containing multiple bioreactors with volumes of 10,000 L or larger. Other products derived from mammalian cell culture in the mid-90s also required large production capacity (Enbrel, while not a mAb, is an Fc-fusion protein which is produced using a similar manufacturing process), driving further expansion. In parallel with the increase in bioreactor production capacity throughout the bioprocessing industry, improvements in the production processes resulted in increased expression levels and higher cell densities, which combined to provide much higher product titers.\n\nToday, the potential of combining high titer process technology with the large installed bioreactor base has resulted in a great excess of production capacity for mAbs, far outstripping the increase in market demands over recent years. This has stimulated discussions of the controversial issues of the best use of current production capacity, the impact of manufacturing cost of goods (COGs), and the choice of the appropriate mAb production technology for emerging product candidates. Should companies choose conventional bioprocessing technologies, or invest in novel technologies which may lead to superior expression levels or lower production costs? Have process development strategies adjusted to this paradigm shift where nearly unlimited capacity and very low COGs are",

The number of approved antibody drugs in the US and the EU has increased nearly three-fold from 2010 to 2019 (Kaplon et al., 2020). In 2020, it is reported that 15 antibody therapeutics have been approved worldwide (Kaplon and Reichert, 2021). Because the production of antibody drug utilizes the biosynthetic process of living organisms, the design and management of the development and manufacturing process affect the quality of the final product directly. Moreover, the quality among different production lots differs considerably even if the same production cells are used, and properties of the follow-on biologics (biosimilars) made by different manufacturers differ from those of the original products. \n\nTherefore, physicochemical properties such as structural heterogeneity and aggregation should be evaluated in detail to demonstrate product consistency and equivalence. To address this situation, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q6B provides guidelines for specification on the characterization of biopharmaceuticals, and the establishment of acceptance criteria as well as analytical procedures (ICH Q6B, 1999). In terms of primary structure, structural heterogeneity includes posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as glycosylation, disulfide bond mismatch, deamidation of asparagine residues, oxidation of methionine and tryptophan, glycosylation, and cleavage of the polypeptide chain (Liu et al., 2008;Beck et al., 2013). The variety of higher-order structures, such as denaturation, misfolding, and aggregation, should also be evaluated. The results of these quality attributes may vary depending on the measurement method, and many technologies are under development (Le Basle et al., 2020). \n\nNational metrology institutes (NMIs) have been leading to establish traceable measurement to a known reference, particularly focusing on the development of a reference material (RM) traceable to Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s (SI).",

            "text": "ABSTRACT The manufacturing of therapeutic biologics can result in a heterogeneous population of charge variants, encompassing many quality attributes which could impact activity and pharmacokinetics. Monitoring the relative abundance of these charge variants to demonstrate process consistency is an expectation of regulatory agencies. Control of the relative abundance of charge variants is also necessary to ensure product comparability across the product lifecycle. We have observed a significant shift in the relative abundance of charged species, as measured by capillary isoelectric focusing, during clarified cell culture fluid holds for several monoclonal antibodies. This lack of stability requires that the hold time for this process intermediate be significantly curtailed, eliminating manufacturing flexibility. We have identified the cause of this shift in relative abundance of charged species as changes in glycation levels, focused predominantly on three conserved, solvent accessible, lysine residues. Mutants of a model protein were generated that show increased charge state stability can be gained by eliminating these reactive lysines. Further, characterization studies were conducted on these mutants to determine the impact to biological activity and stability of the molecule, with no detrimental effects observed. Incorporating this knowledge into the assessments of candidate drugs could allow for the selection of molecules less susceptible to this product degradation pathway, allowing for greater manufacturing flexibility. This process of identifying and removing reactive lysine residues could be useful in the design of drug candidates with improved charge state stability, across a range of modalities. ABSTRACT",

            "text": "here is an ongoing debate on how antibodies are being generated, produced and used (Gray, 2020;Marx, 2020). Or rather, there are two debates, which are not necessarily related to each other. The first one concerns the quality of antibodies used in scientific research and the repercussions for the validity of results (Bradbury & Pluckthun, 2015). The second debate is about the use of animals to generate and produce antibodies. Although these are two different issues, we observe that the debates have become entangled with arguments for one topic incorrectly being used to motivate the other and vice versa. This is not helpful, and we should disentangle the knot. \n\nPolyclonal antibodies are being criticized because they suffer from cross-reactivity, high background and batch-to-batch variation (Bradbury & Pluckthun, 2015). Monoclonal antibodies produced from hybridomas are criticized because they often lack specificity owing to genetic heterogeneity introduced during hybridoma generation that impairs the quality of the monoclonals (Bradbury et al, 2018). These are valid criticisms and producing antibodies in a recombinant manner will, indeed, help to improve quality and specificity. But a mediocre antibody will remain a mediocre antibody, no matter how it is produced. Recombinant methods will just produce a mediocre antibody more consistently. \n\nGetting a good antibody is not easy and much depends on the nature and complexity of the antigen. And low-quality antibodies are often the result of poor screening, poor quality control, incomplete characterization and the lack of international standards. Nevertheless, the technologies to ensure good selection and to guarantee consistent quality are much more advanced than a decade ago, and scientists and antibody producers should implement these to deliver high-quality antibodies. Whether antibodies are generated by animal immunization or from na\u0131 \u00a8ve or synthetic antibody libraries is less relevant; they can all be produced recombinantly, and screening and characterization are needed in all cases to determine quality, and if the antibody is fit for purpose. \n\nBut criticisms on the quality of many antibodies and pleas for switching to recombinant production of antibodies cannot be mixed up with a call to ban animal immunization.",

For instance, Enbrel (etanercept), which consists of part of a TNF\u03b1-receptor fused to an Fc-domain and Epogen, a recombinant erythropoietin, are well-known marketed molecules that have presented difficult analytical challenges [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. One common theme between many of these new formats is that they often contain multiple glycosylation sites [13][14][15] and more complex glycosylation patterns [16,17] that present challenges from a biopharmaceutical development perspective given the aforementioned importance of glycans on product quality. \n\nTypically, therapeutic glycoproteins are produced from stable recombinant cell lines, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and it is well known that the inherent differences between individual cell line clones and their culture processes can significantly impact the glycosylation patterns of the resulting product [9,18,19]. During the transition period between late stage lead molecule selection and early stage process development it is not uncommon that multiple lead molecules, cell line clones or bioreactor processes are tracked in parallel and one of the rate limiting factors is often how fast pure sample material can be obtained for analytical profiling and subsequent interpretation. Therefore, in order to support the iterative process of project lead molecule selection, cell line selection and cell culture process development, high throughput analytics, which preferably work directly on crude culture media samples, are key to providing rapid product quality data that can be used to drive decisions on cell line selection and process development.",

Thus, for high-demand biologics, it should be feasible to continue scaling the intensified Process C to a 20,000-L bioreactor while maintaining high titers in the production phase. \n\nThe intensified platform fed-batch Process C developed in this study is very effective for mAb manufacturing. Since cell culture titer and production scale are two of the most important parameters to determine manufacturing costs (Kelley 2009;Mir-Artigues et al. 2019), Process C with much higher titers (Table 2) and successful scale up in large-scale manufacturing makes the manufacturing costs lower than in the fed-batch Process A and Process B. Effective mAb manufacturing with higher titer and volumetric productivity, better robustness and lower costs has been a goal for both academia and the biopharmaceutical industry for the last 3 decades. To achieve this goal, both fed-batch and perfusion modes have been intensively studied since the 1990s (Bielser et al. 2018;Kunert and Reinhart 2016;Li et al. 2010).",

As technologies mature, pressure on cost and timelines becomes greater for delivering scalable and robust processes. Overall, process development should be viewed as a continuum from the early stages up to process validation. Here we outline a lean approach on upstream development during the initial phases to optimize yields while maintaining the desired product quality profiles. Early-stage process development was designed to lead to the establishment of a baseline process and to systematically include experiments with input parameters that have a high impact on performance and quality. At this stage, potential for pre-harvest titer and yield increases as well as product quality challenges were identified. Feed adjustments and systematic experiments with top, high, and medium impact parameters have then been performed to develop a robust and scalable process. This approach was applied to two early stage upstream processes.",

            "text": "Recombinant therapeutic proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have become a major class of biotherapeutics to treat various human diseases. 1,2 To date, more than 90 mAbs have been approved. 3 To ensure product quality, attributes that can potentially affect drug safety and efficacy, known as critical quality attributes, need to be well characterized and monitored during the drug development and manufacturing process. 5][6] Such SVs have been shown to exist in both natural and recombinant proteins, 7 and are believed to be caused by a number of mechanisms including DNA mutations during replication, and transcriptional and translational errors during the protein biosynthesis process. 5 Thanks to the high fidelity of biologic systems, which evolved to prevent the occurrence of such spontaneous errors, the SVs are usually present at a very low level (<0.1%) in natural biologic proteins. 5,8 However, during therapeutic protein drug development, companies continuously aim to increase the protein titer and process productivity to meet global demand and reduce the cost of goods for expanded patient access. This has led to the wide use of the so-called intensified bioreactor manufacturing systems, which are designed to maximize cell density and specific productivity for the target therapeutic proteins during the cell culture process. Such intensified production systems can impose higher than normal expression machinery stress to the production cell lines. 0][11] In addition, to further increase the product titer, cell line development usually goes through multiple rounds of selection with increasing selective stresses to find the top-producing cell clone. This selection process could potentially introduce DNA mutations to the cell lines. If not properly screened, it could lead to unexpectedly high levels of SVs in the final drug products. 7,12,13 iven these concerns regarding how elevated SVs might affect drug quality, both the industry and regulatory agencies have started to pay more attention to SVs. Over the past decade, substantial efforts and resources have been invested across the industry to better understand the causes of SVs and their control in biologic development. As a result of these collective efforts, several control strategies have been developed and proposed by different companies to best monitor and mitigate the SV issue during their product and process development. 6,8,13",

            "text": "In addition to their complexity, most biological products are fragile and sensitive to changes in the manufacturing process; therefore, even minor changes in the manufacturing process could significantly affect the quality and functional capacity of biological products. Therefore, to ensure product safety, effectiveness, consistency, and quality, it is critical to tightly control the manufacturing process as well as source materials. Furthermore, it is critical to develop new test methods for biological product characterization that provide enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value. \n\nIn the case of regenerative medicine and cellular therapy products that are regulated by the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT) in CBER, there are several critical manufacturing issues to consider early in the development of a cellular product. These include the control of source materials, identification of critical product quality attributes, and development of a sufficiently robust manufacturing process. Regenerative medicine is the \"process of creating living, functional tissues to repair or replace tissue or organ function lost due to age, disease, damage, or congenital defects\" (Perez-Terzic and Childers, 2014; Mao and Mooney, 2015), and cell therapies rely on the administration of viable cells into a patient's body to grow, replace, or repair damaged tissue to treat a disease or an injury. When cells are starting materials as well as final, finished therapeutic products, the regenerative medicine cellular therapy industry faces challenges in manufacturing large-scale and high-quality cellular products at a cost meeting market expectations. Comprehensive cell characterizations that are designed to distinguish critical quality attributes of cellular products are considered to help meet regulatory expectations for product identity, purity, and potency (Sung et al., 2020). Reliable and predictable product characterization during the early stage of product development could help detect subpopulations of cells in starting materials as well as in final products that might not be effective or that could possibly present safety concerns. \n\nWell-designed CIVMs that recapitulate critical physiological conditions have the potential to contribute toward developing and improving test methods for product characterization and toward identifying product attributes that are predictive of safety, efficacy, and potency.",

Although these variations are usually within a certain control range, large variations beyond the control range may occur, and products not conforming to the intended quality may be produced.

            "text": "Process analytical technology (PAT) for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is defined by an integrated set of advanced and automated methods that analyze the compositions and biophysical properties of cell culture fluids, cellfree product streams, and biotherapeutic molecules that are ultimately formulated into concentrated products. In-line or near-line probes and systems are remarkably well developed, although challenges remain in the determination of the absence of viral loads, detecting microbial or mycoplasma contamination, and applying datadriven deep learning to process monitoring and soft sensors. In this review, we address the current status of PAT for both batch and continuous processing steps and discuss its potential impact on facilitating the continuous manufacture of biotherapeutics.\n\nMonoclonal Antibodies mAbs have evolved from being scientific tools derived from murine hybridomas in 1975 to biotherapeutic molecules based on humanized antibodies (see Glossary). The first mAb for therapeutic use in humans was approved in 1986 and the first bispecific mAb (bsAb; catumaxomab) was approved in 2009 [1]. Humanized antibodies include IgG1s, 2s, and 4s grafted onto the Fc and Fv regions, which comprise human sequences. Currently, there ar\u1ebd 570 antibody therapeutics at various clinical phases, with 62 in late-stage trials [2]. Global mAb sales have grown from US $18.5 billion in 2010 [1] to US $98 billion in 2017 with 57 mAbs and 11 biosimilars in clinical use as of the end of 2017' [3]. Of these, 93% are produced in USA and Europe and half are based on fully human genetic sequences [3].\n\nOver time, several classes of mAb have evolved [1]. Early products (Erbitux, Remicade, and rituximab) were obtained by grafting antigen-specific variable domains of mouse antibodies onto constant domains of a human antibody. Humanized mAbs (e.g., Avastin, Mylotarg, and Herceptin), based on a murine hypervariable region grafted onto a human antibody framework, resulted in decreased immunogenic properties and reduced formation of antidrug antibodies. Ultimately, human mAbs emerged from research that utilized phage",

            "text": "Hence, considerable focus is being imparted on biologicals as active pharmaceutical ingredients to manage, control, and eradicate diseases. A survey conducted between January 2018 and June 2022 in the United States and/or European Union (EU) witnessed the approval of 180 distinct biopharmaceutical active ingredients that entered the market and they could be categorized as recombinant clotting factors; recombinant thrombolytics, anticoagulants, and other blood-related products; recombinant hormones; recombinant growth factors; recombinant interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); vaccines; monoclonal-antibody-based products; and other recombinant products. These biologicals are mostly focused on cancer, followed by inflammation-related conditions, neutropenia, diabetes, viral and bacterial infection, weight control, weight loss (Wegovy), and Alzheimer's disease (Aduhelm). The genre of monoclonal antibodies continues to lead in the number of approvals and sales (Fig. 1), although COVID-19 vaccines are listed as the highest-grossing individual products [4]. Despite continual therapeutic attention, structural complexity and the larger molecular size of biopharmaceuticals add up to difficulty in drug design and formulation development. Hence, subsequent manufacturing and distribution of biopharmaceuticals also face challenges including their storage which often demands refrigeration. Further, regulatory compliance in biopharmaceutical manufacturing is one of the toughest hurdles that often accompany facility inspection. Considering the complex multi-layered manufacturing process and critical in-process quality controls and analysis of finished products, it becomes a challenge for manufacturers to successfully comply with the norms of regulatory science and good manufacturing practices. Beyond pharmaceutical considerations, the clinical administration of biologics also demands attention, especially for immunogenic reactions that need to be monitored in patients following the administration of the biopharmaceuticals. \n\n\u00a9 2024 The Authors.

Since then, an increase in the development of recombinant protein production has taken place to humanize mAbs to increase in vivo safety and efficacy 2,3,4 . Most of the recombinant protein production processes employ Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the ease with which they can be adapted to serum free media, their ability to produce proteins with similar post-translational modifications to that of an innate human protein and their dependability as host cells 5,6 .\n\nDemand is growing to deliver product faster, and for larger patient populations with consistent quality. In addition to the economic benefits, the repertoire of diseases treated by mAbs is increasing, which now includes autoimmune diseases, post-transplantation complications, arthritis, and cancers 7 . Average yields for modern commercial mAb production lines are typically in the range of 5-6 g/L and continue to rise 5 . In part, this has been accomplished through CHO cell engineering and improved production line screening using high-throughput bioreactors 8 . However, most increases in protein production have been attributed to process improvements, including advancements in media optimization, cell culture conditions, and enhanced feeding strategies 7,9,10 . Nutrient supplementation is essential not only for proper cell growth but also for efficient production of high quality protein. Furthermore, cells require the stoichiometric addition of specific nutrients, requiring additional understanding for feeding strategy optimization 6,11 . Traditional optimization methods include individual media component titration and media blending with mixture designs. However, these methods are time consuming, labor intensive, and involve risks associated with human error 12,13 .\n\nMedia optimization studies previously relied on shake flasks and 1-2 L bioreactors which may be prohibitively expensive in terms of raw materials and human capital. Microplates have also been used but these methods provide limited scalability. Furthermore, this may still require multiple time-consuming runs that introduce batch-to-batch variability which obscures the CQA variability caused by media composition and feeding strategy bench-scale bioreactors through their online feedback control of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and acid/base consumption as well as their real-time data output of quality parameters including off gas composition.

            "text": "With an increasing number of approvals every year, the biopharmaceutical market is dominated by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which are most commonly produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Kaplon and Reichert, 2018;Walsh, 2018). Consequently, CHO cells have been actively engineered over the last decade in order to express high levels of a wide range of mAbs and other therapeutic biomolecules. Various strategies have been applied to enable optimized CHO cell bioprocessing, aiming not only for an increased specific productivity but also for a higher cell viability while reducing the amount of undesired by-products (Kunert and Reinhart, 2016). Frequently used approaches include shifts in cell culture parameters like temperature and pH as well as the addition of certain media supplements or the use of controlled feeding strategies (Trummer et al., 2006;Fan et al., 2015;Vergara et al., 2018). Various studies have shown that a temperature shift from 37 to 32 \u2022 C drastically increases recombinant protein production, potentially due to improved cell viability (Yoon et al., 2004;Ahn et al., 2008). However, it was also shown that an improved energy metabolism under hyperosmotic conditions favors specific productivity of CHO cells (Lee et al., 2003). While most of these studies focused on the effects of one factor at a time, more systemic approaches such as quality by design and design of experiments have been used to study the link between applied parameters whilst further pushing the limits of recombinant protein production (Looby et al., 2011;Nagashima et al., 2013;Weng et al., 2020). \n\nNevertheless, there is still limited knowledge about of how these process alterations affect fundamental biological processes within the production cells and how these alterations ultimately relate to quality attributes such as, e.g., charge variants which could alter product efficacy and safety (Torkashvand and Vaziri, 2017;Papathanasiou and Kontoravdi, 2020).",

Testing demonstrated the comparability of critical product qualities between the two scales and, more importantly, that our final clinical trial product met all pre\u2010set product quality specifications.

Further, we demonstrate full scalability of this convecdiff technology with experimental data demonstrating suitability for bioprocessing at different scales. This technology results in more than 10-fold higher productivity compared to Protein A resins, which is maintained during scale up. We demonstrate the influence of residence times, feed titers and the cleaning regime on productivity and indicate optimal utilization of the convecdiff membrane based on feed titer availability. The underlying high productivity and short cycle times of this material enable the purification of monoclonal antibodies with 10-times less chromatography material used per batch and utilization of the membrane within one batch.

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other derived therapeutic proteins are currently one of the most important product classes in the pharmaceutical industry and will likely remain relevant for many years to come [1,2]. Typical process formats comprise mammalian expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultivated in fed-batch processes with final production scales of several cubic meters [3]. Increasing market demands for monoclonal antibody therapeutics and the pressure for cost-reduction in their production [4,5] have led to new manufacturing approaches and improved facility utilization strategies e.g., continuous production [6,7]. For implementation of upcoming process intensification technologies, pharmaceutical companies can aim for scale out by building additional manufacturing capacities or for intensification in existing pharmaceutical production plants. Both strategies require substantial investments and the changes have to be balanced against cost and downtime during installation and subsequent re-qualification of equipment. In the case of fully continuous production processes, an implementation in existing fed-batch facilities is often impossible due to open technical and regulatory questions such as higher complexity and increased media amounts [7][8][9]. A smart step for the development and maintenance of marketable antibody portfolios is to search for intensification strategies, which debottleneck production chains using available capacities whenever possible and which are implementable in existing facilities, such as N \u2212 1 perfusion [10]. \n\nThe concept of pre-stage (N \u2212 1) perfusion shifts biomass production away from capital-intensive large-scale reactors into the smaller pre-stage systems, as described by Kloth et al. [10]. Cell retention combined with media exchange facilitates robust exponential cell proliferation without any loss of biomass and can be achieved by a number of technologies, which differ in robustness and scalability [11]. Perfusion processes have the potential to reach over 100 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL [12], so that the required biomass generation of several sequential batch pre-stages can be combined into one perfusion stage. Consequently, the number and size of seed bioreactors could be reduced shortening overall process timelines.",

            "text": "The bioprocessing industry at a crossroads Manufacturing processes for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have evolved tremendously since the first licensed mAb product in 1986. The rapid growth in product demand for mAbs triggered parallel efforts to increase production capacity through construction of large bulk manufacturing plants as well as improvements in cell culture processes to raise product titers. This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels. The reduction of capacity and cost pressures for current state-of-the-art bulk production processes may shift the focus of process development efforts and have important implications for both plant design and product development strategies for both biopharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies. which would generate batches of 15-100 kg from 10 kL-25 kL bioreactors. Large manufacturing plants are designed with multiple bioreactors supplying one (or sometimes two) purification train(s). The individual purification unit operations can be completed in under two days, and often in just one day, and therefore several bioreactors can be matched to the output of a single purification train. The increased capacity of these plants arising from the elevated titers will decrease the drug substance COGs, by virtue of the economies of scale afforded by the large bioreactors. As will be described in more detail below, these plants are capable of producing enormous quantities of mAbs with very attractive costs.\n\nFurther, this consensus manufacturing process is amenable to standardization that establishes a common processing platform for many mAbs. Each company is likely to use a slightly different platform process, but the similarities outweigh the differences when it comes to the process flowsheet ( Fig. 1) and the typical manufacturing plant design. The use of a platform approach reduces the investment per mAb product candidate, streamlines development efforts, simplifies raw material procurement and warehousing, and reduces scale-up and technology transfer complexities. Several companies have revealed that they have very similar development timelines from the start of cell line development through first-in-human clinical trials, and many are using common tools",

            "text": "In manufacturing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it is crucial to be able to predict how process conditions and supplements affect productivity and quality attributes, especially glycosylation. Supplemental inputs, such as amino acids and trace metals in the media, are reported to affect cell metabolism and glycosylation; quantifying their effects is essential for effective process development. We aim to present and validate, through a commercially relevant cell culture process, a technique for modeling such effects efficiently. While existing models can predict mAb production or glycosylation dynamics under specific process configurations, adapting them to new processes remains challenging, because it involves modifying the model structure and often requires some mechanistic understanding. Here, a modular modeling technique for adapting an existing model for a fed\u2010batch Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture process without structural modifications or mechanistic insight is presented. Instead, data is used, obtained from designed experimental perturbations in media supplementation, to train and validate a supplemental input effect model, which is used to \u201cpatch\u201d the existing model. The combined model can be used for model\u2010based process development to improve productivity and to meet product quality targets more efficiently. The methodology and analysis are generally applicable to other CHO cell lines and cell types.",

            "text": "Recombinant biotherapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), require the establishment of an appropriate three-dimensional structure that allows the exposure of specific domains for the recognition of target sequences. This structure and its maintenance are dependent upon the protein chemical composition and the environments to which it is exposed [1]. \n\nDuring their biosynthesis, recombinant proteins are subject to posttranslational modifications that provide an inherent amount of heterogeneity in their molecular structure in addition to further modifications that can be acquired during the purification, formulation, and shelf life [2]. \n\nAlthough intrinsic batch-to-batch heterogeneity is present in mAbs [3], it can be controlled during their manufacturing process, allowing the establishment of acceptance ranges strongly associated with the pharmacological response 2 BioMed Research International of the drug, in order to have consistency and ensure the mAb's safety and efficacy. \n\nDue to the continuous improvements in the biotechnological industry processes, several guidelines have been published to ensure that potential modifications associated with those developments, both within and among manufactures, do not have or potentially alter the pharmacological behavior or induce adverse effects on patients [4][5][6]. Furthermore, advances in physicochemical and functional characterization have increased the knowledge of protein's attributes and their relationship with pharmacological responses [7,8]. Thereby, the assessment of physicochemical comparability among batches coming from process changes throughout a product-licensed life cycle [9] provides sufficient evidence to maintain its denomination and product label without the need of additional clinical studies [3]. This approach can be employed to demonstrate comparability of biosimilars and demarcate the extent of additional clinical assessment. \n\nTrastuzumab is a humanized immunoglobulin isotype 1 (IgG1) targeted against the extracellular portion of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, p185) which is overexpressed in approximately 15 to 30% of invasive breast cancer cases [10,11].",

            "text": "Biologically derived drugs represent a growing sector of the pharmaceutical market. 1 Biologics have emerged as successful treatments for numerous diseases, including diabetes, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, anemia, and HIV. 2 Many recombinant therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are produced in some animal cells which are able to produce human-like post-translational modifications. Animal cell cultures are the production method of choice owing to well-characterized technologies for gene transfection, amplification, and clone selection. 3 There is currently little alternative. Animal cells are commonly grown in a fed-batch bioreactor as such processes afford ease of operation and scale-up, and provide a higher volumetric productivity compared with batch cultures. \n\nThe pharmaceutical sector has been lagging behind in the use of model-based methodologies for optimization and control. 4,5 evelopment and design of biopharmaceutical processes in particular present unique challenges arising from the complexity of the cell metabolism and regulatory mechanisms. Manufacturing practices usually relied on quality by testing, that is, by controlling the critical process parameters that are known to affect product quality within a given range and eventually testing the intermediate product-in-process and endproduct quality in order to validate the selected parameter range. This limits process development to a narrow operating region and, to an extent, focuses more on reproducibility instead on productivity. In response to this, the Process Analytical Technology and Quality by Design (QbD) initiatives of the U.S., European, and Japanese regulatory agencies call for a mechanistic model-based basis for process development and optimization of all pharmaceutical products. QbD is defined as a \"systematic approach to development that begins with predefined objectives and emphasizes product and process understanding and process control based on sound science and quality risk management\". 6 QbD is thus a conceptual framework that aims to build product quality at every stage of development and production by making use of knowledge (first-principles and constitutive laws) between process inputs and end-quality of the product. Application of QbD principles requires full integration of process analytical technologies and model-based tools to develop a systematic approach for optimizing the output of interest and controlling its reproducibility.",

            "text": "Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have gained significant attention in the biopharmaceutical field due to their capability to target two different targets or two epitopes on one antigen, potentially enabling the design of novel therapeutic mechanisms of action (MoA) and enhancing efficacy [1]. BsAbs achieve their specific functions due to their unique molecular structure. However, this necessitates meticulous design and development to guarantee both their efficacy and manufacturability [2,3]. \n\nManufacturability refers to the characteristics and considerations related to large-scale production and storage. It includes optimizing expression systems, cell line development, upstream and downstream processing, formulation, stability, quality control, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By addressing these factors, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes can be developed to produce high-quality BsAbs products. As an important part of developability, [4] which refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will evolve into a manufacturable, stable, safe and effective drug, manufacturability should be evaluated and assessed early in the discovery phase. Ideally, potential liabilities should be identified and mitigated as early as possible [5,6]. Antibodies with poor manufacturability will bring enormous challenges to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) development, manufacturing, formulation, storage, transportation and administration, and may even lead to the failure in clinical trial [7,8]. \n\nAs one of the most common manufacturability issues, antibody aggregation is highly undesirable. It may complicate the production process, impair biological activity, and increase the risk of immunogenicity [9][10][11][12]. Antibody aggregation could be mitigated through diverse approaches, including the development of purification process [13,14], and formulation optimization [15][16][17]. However, significant antibody aggregation that leads to product precipitation during downstream production will likely require sequence engineering [10,18,19]. The effectiveness of sequence engineering heavily relies on the fundamental understanding of aggregation mechanism at molecular level, mainly involving colloidal stability and conformational stability [20,21].",

            "text": "LLPS of several purification intermediates provoke challenges to the drug substance manufacturing process of mAb-X Figure 1a (left panel) depicts the purification process developed for mAb-X, a human IgG1-\u03bb antibody. The mAb-X drug substance produced by the manufacturing process met product-quality specifications suitable for use in clinical studies. However, when the purification process intermediates were stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C, several of the intermediates showed distinct layers resulting in two clear liquid phases (Figure 1a, middle panel). After these intermediates were equilibrated to room temperature and mixed thoroughly, the intermediates became a single homogeneous optically clear phase, and no longer exhibited two liquid phases (data no shown). Once returned to 2 to 8\u00b0C, these intermediates initially became turbid, and then again separated into two phases, which is behavior indicative of LLPS. Both liquid phases contained mAb-X, but the upper phase contained mAb-X at concentrations of 1 to 3 mg/ mL, whereas the lower phase contained the antibody at concentrations of ~150 mg/mL. These observations were consistent with published literature pertaining to LLPS. 1,2,10,19 In large-scale production of therapeutic mAbs, purification intermediates are often kept at ambient temperature for brief intervals (e.g. up to 7 days), but a lower temperature (2-8\u00b0C) is often preferred for longer duration (e.g. more than 7 days). During storage, the aggregate level of mAb-X in the purification intermediates increased quickly when stored at ambient temperature; in contrast, the aggregation rate was reduced dramatically at refrigerator temperatures (Figure 1b). To maintain product quality, storing these intermediates at a refrigerated temperature is preferable, but, as detailed above, resulted in LLPS. \n\nWhen LLPS occurred in these intermediate process pools during storage, the lower phases were found to be highly viscous. The viscosity of the lower (heavy) phases remained exceptionally high (>100 cP) even after the solutions were warmed to room temperature. Mixing these highly viscous heterogeneous intermediates at large-scale and achieving solution homogeneity was time-consuming.",

            "text": "GIGA-2050 is the first example of a new class of drugs, recombinant polyclonal hyperimmune globulins. Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies [16]. Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia [17] but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies. \n\nAs multivalent antibody therapeutics, recombinant hyperimmune globulins represent a potent treatment for infectious disease that decreases the likelihood of antigenic escape. Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters [18]. Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses. \n\nWe have demonstrated that a conventional mAb platform approach can be applied to a recombinant hyperimmune globulin product to achieve desired separation of aggregates and process related impurities. The platform production process has produced the GIGA-2050 drug substance and drug product lots at different scales and manufacturing sites that have demonstrated no substantial differences in the purity measurements and impurity clearance for in-process steps and analytically comparable characteristics and quality attributes of the final drug substance. In the future, we hope to apply similar methods to larger scale GMP runs, for example, bioreactors with a capacity of 1000 L or higher.",

            "text": "Furthermore, increasing cell densities, longer cell-culture duration, and higher product titers have challenged the basic design of the downstream train to deal with additional cell mass, cell debris, HCP, DNA, adventitious and endogenous viruses, and other impurities like media components. 5,9 The ability to overcome these obstacles necessitates the development of new materials with unique properties, such as membranes with novel retention or very low-fouling characteristics, chromatographic ligands with unique binding characteristics, materials designed to facilitate non-traditional unit operations (e.g., precipitation, flocculation, high capacity adsorptive filters, and charged ultrafiltration membranes), that have the potential to dramatically improve downstream processing, both in terms of capacity and impurity removal capability. Furthermore, in addition to newer materials with superior characteristics, innovative methods of operating purification processes are desirable. 10,11 The development of laterally fed membrane adsorbers is a recent advance wherein significant improvement was observed by changing the flow-geometry of existing membrane adsorber chemistry. 12 Other groups have leveraged process parameters like column loading 13 or wash conditions during chromatography. 14 iologics purification processes are commonly designed around the primary-capture-step architecture, which typically involves an affinity-based chromatography step. In a monoclonal antibody (mAb) product purification platform, the capture step is especially convenient because it is a Protein A affinity step. 10,15 Yet, in a modern industrial mAb purification process, the 95-98% purity of Protein A-eluted product with respect to DNA and HCP is insufficient, and a complex and expensive polishing train is still required. Complexes of DNA and DNAhistone have been reported to be a major component of cell culture fluid interfering with protein chromatography. 8,16,17 While Protein A and the subsequent viral inactivation removes most of those impurities, remaining levels of process-and productrelated impurities present significant challenges downstream. Previous studies have demonstrated that most impurities that co-purify with the antibody do so by associating with the antibody itself. 18,19",

            "text": "Industry favors recombinant protein expression systems that have a long and successful track record, specifically with three goals in mind: high quality, high yields, and low costs. In addition, such systems should meet the demands of an industrial process with respect to robustness, and economic sustainability, and must comply with regulatory requirements. This is particularly relevant for pharmaceutical proteins produced according to good manufacturing practice (GMP), a set of guidelines ensuring that biopharmaceuticals are sufficient in terms of quality and batch-to-batch consistency in order to prevent harm to patients. The industry has therefore focused its resources on a small number of cell-based systems, in particular CHO cells and E. coli, which are now considered the gold standards for industrial protein manufacturing. \n\nMany complex proteins, including most therapeutic antibodies, are routinely produced in CHO cells because they have the capacity to carry out authentic post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. Recombinant proteins produced in CHO cells are secreted into the culture medium to facilitate recovery and purification. Various strategies have been pursued to maximize the productivity of CHO cell cultures, including: (1) the engineering of production lines and expression vectors, (2) amplification of the expression cassette, (3) optimization of the cell culture medium, including the switch from early formulations containing serum to chemically defined and near protein-free formulations that simplify protein purification even further, (4) increasing the cell density during cultivation, and (5) the introduction of fermentation strategies that balance the nutrient supply while maintaining optimal cultivation conditions (Hausmann et al., 2018;Ritacco et al., 2018). These developments have led to remarkable increases in yields. For example, early processes for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies achieved titers of hundreds of milligrams per liter, but this has increased to routine titers of 5-10 g/L and in some cases up to 20 g/L (Pujar et al., 2017), reducing the cost of goods to as little as \u20ac20/g (Kelley, 2007). Combined with GMP-compliant cell lines and processes and well-established approval procedures, it is hard to imagine that the CHO platform will be displaced by any other expression system for the manufacturing of complex proteins in the near future.",

            "text": "The development and manufacture of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a highly regulated process for which guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation and regulatory agencies state the levels of heterogeneity allowed in a biopharmaceutical product. 1 MAbs and related products are subject to a wide variety of modifications including glycosylation, lysine truncation, oxidation, deamidation, disulfide bond scrambling, fragmentation, aggregation, glycation, isomerization and pyroglutamate formation. 2 Some modifications can affect drug efficacy and safety, and can thus be considered critical quality attributes (CQAs). CQAs are directly related to the components present in and the physiochemical conditions of the cell culture media at the time of fermentation 1,[3][4][5][6] and can be influenced by critical process parameters. To assess product quality, it is therefore mandatory to closely monitor CQAs, using adequate analytical techniques that utilise differences in physicochemical properties of the analytes, such as size, surface charge or hydrophobicity. \n\nThe surface charge of a mAb can be subject to change by several of the modifications mentioned above, either by providing or depleting acidic or basic residues or by changing protein higher order structure. 7 This surface charge diversity has been utilised in the past to analyse mAb heterogeneity with charge sensitive methods, most notably cation exchange chromatography (CEX). 2][13] In industry, charge variant analysis (CVA) is commonly used for direct comparison of different product batches to ensure consistent product quality. Recently CVA, applying both weak cation exchange (WCX) and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, was used in a process analytical technology (PAT) framework as a powerful tool to control and optimise upstream and downstream processing. 14 hile well suited for comparability studies, one limitation is the necessity to perform elaborate sample preparation procedures and follow-up experiments for initial identification of the peaks and in case of any out-of-specification events. These experimental procedures usually involve peak collection followed by buffer exchange to allow further analysis, which can be time consuming and costly. 15",

Thus, changes to manufacturing parameters are routinely introduced throughout preclinical and clinical development and even after approval for marketing. However, maintaining the necessary structural and functional protein properties can be challenging. 3 One such important product quality attribute (PQA), for example, is the composition of Fc glycans, which can impact many attributes of the therapeutic antibodies. 4 erefore, it is important to perform comparability studies to verify the product quality and efficacy. 5,6 e biopharmaceutical industry often utilizes \"codon optimization\" (synonymous gene recoding or nucleotide sequence optimization) to improve protein yield. Each optimization algorithm is different, but generally use a set of variable attributes, such as, codon adaptation index (CAI), GC content and/or the complexity/stability of the mRNA secondary structure often reflected by minimum free energy (MFE) values to recode a given sequence. 7 The underlying assumption during synonymous gene recoding is that synonymous mutations will not affect protein structure and function. ][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] For example, synonymous recoding of blood coagulation Factor IX has been shown to alter protein conformation and immunogenicity 19,20 thus raising efficacy and safety concerns. \n\nDuring the manufacturing process, the desired transgene is usually introduced into (CHO) cells using two main approaches: random integration (RI) or targeted Integration (TI).",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are widely applied as highly specific and efficient therapeutic agents for various medical conditions, including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. As protein production in cellular systems inherently generates a multitude of molecular variants, manufacturing of mAbs requires stringent control in order to ensure safety and efficacy of the drugs. Moreover, monitoring of mAb variants in the course of the fermentation process may allow instant tuning of process parameters to maintain optimal cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a fast and robust workflow for the characterization of mAb variants in fermentation broth. Sample preparation is minimal in that the fermentation broth is shortly centrifuged before dilution and HPLC-MS analysis in a short 15-min gradient run. In a single analysis, N-glycosylation and truncation variants of the expressed mAb are identified at the intact protein level. Simultaneously, absolute quantification of mAb content in fermentation broth is achieved. The whole workflow features excellent robustness as well as retention time and peak area stability. Additional enzymatic removal of N-glycans enables determination of mAb glycation levels, which are subsequently considered in relative N-glycoform quantification to correct for isobaric galactosylation. Several molecular attributes of the expressed therapeutic protein may thus be continuously monitored to ensure the desired product profile. Application of the described workflow in an industrial environment may therefore substantially enhance in-process control in mAb production, as well as targeted biosimilar development.",

            "text": "Approaches to establishing the comparability of cell therapy products through manufacturing process changes are predicated on manufacturing reproducibility such that products are produced with consistent quality attribute profiles. The core of the scientific problem is to determine both the allowable variation in the product necessary to deliver quality, safety and efficacy and the achievable variation in the manufacturing process, taking account of variation of input or starting materials and variation in the patient population within the autologous setting. The challenge is doing this with the additional variation associated with multiple manufacturing sites while containing cost of goods and costs of validation. Persistent issues underpinning the challenge are associated with a poor understanding of the mechanism of action (MOA), poor definition of product characteristics that influence its quality, safety and efficacy and poor understanding of how changes or variation in the manufacturing process affect these characteristics. \n\nUnless alternative manufacturing approaches can be found to bridge the regulatory and scientific Figure 1. Alternative routes for manufacturing and clinical site process transfer and product delivery. The requirements for regulatory approval, GMP and the level of validation relate, in part, to which sites are used for each element of the manufacturing and clinical process, which in turn dictates how the manufacturing model may be implemented. 1 The following model convention is used to differentiate the origin and scale of the potential routes for manufacturing roll out to multiple sites: Transfer of a product/process from an academic or hospital laboratory to a regulated manufacturing site (0\u00fe1 model); transfer to one or more additional manufacturing/production line(s) or to a regulated manufacturing location(s) within the same jurisdiction, either before (N model) or after Phase III clinical trials (N\u00fe1 model); transfer of product/process to regulated manufacturing site(s) within different jurisdictions (N\u00feM model), that is, a site in each of the major geographical markets, transfer to 20 or 30 processing sites (eg, sites in international Centers of Excellence for major clinical specialisms) or transfer to 100 to 500 processing machine platforms, that is, systems \"within a GMP setting\" or \"GMP in-a-box\" systems (an example of true process scalability). challenges of comparability, realizing a sustainable and investable business model for affordable autologous cell therapy supply is likely to be extremely demanding, even within a clinical setting.",

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are commonly prepared for biomanufacturing by single cell cloning post-transfection and recovery, followed by lead clone screening, generation of a research cell bank (RCB), cell culture process development, and manufacturing of a master cell bank (MCB) to be used in early phase clinical manufacturing. In this study, it was found that an additional round of cloning and clone selection from an established monoclonal RCB or MCB (i.e., re-cloning) significantly improved titer for multiple late phase monoclonal antibody upstream processes. Quality attributes remained comparable between the processes using the parental clones and the re-clones. For two CHO cells expressing different antibodies, the re-clone performance was successfully scaled up at 500-L or at 2000-L bioreactor scales, demonstrating for the first time that the re-clone is suitable for late phase and commercial manufacturing processes for improvement of titer while maintaining comparable product quality to the early phase process.",

            "text": "Unlike traditional chemical synthesis, the production of a biologic product from a living system does not follow an exact science as chemistry. Manufacturing biologics and biosimilars require the design of complex multistep processes utilizing mammalian and microbial cell cultures to manufacture therapeutic proteins [46]. \"The process is the product\" is a long existing paradigm of the biologic manufacturing process. This implies that any variations in the production process could significantly alter the product's safety and efficacy profile. The current biologic manufacturing facilities combine both analytical and process development methods. This allows for the assessment of the scale up process while ensuring that it maintains the adequate productivity of a quality product [47]. Once the biologic has demonstrated sufficient safety and efficacy (Appendix A7), it then proceeded on to receiving regulatory agency and business feedback. The product is then finally approved and licensed. The steps in the preparation of a typical biologic are shown in Figure 2, below. Impurities need to be constantly checked for and removed from the process due to the sensitivity of the process. During the biologic manufacturing process, the key contaminants are impurities in the host cell proteins (HCPs), cell debris, cell culture medium serum proteins, immunoglobulin affinity ligands, protein A or protein G affinity ligands, viruses, endotoxin, DNA, and non-protein cell wall constituents. A typical downstream process mainly consists of three stages: capture, intermediate purification, and polishing. These stages aid in the removal of soluble contaminants from crude feed, bulk impurities, and trace contaminants, respectively [48]. Other parameters also need to be closely monitored and maintained, such as pH, flow rate, temperature, purity and media. Manufacturers are required to maintain clean equipment and regulatory approved manufacturing methods [49]. The purification of biologics routinely involves chromatography (including affinity chromatography), filtration, and sterilizing filtration due to the complex nature of the proteomic pool. \n\nThe manufacture and testing of biological therapeutics have strong approved industry Impurities need to be constantly checked for and removed from the process due to the sensitivity of the process.",

Factors that are generally considered important are the quality of the raw materials (which should be of pharmaceutical grade and preferably free of animal-derived substances), the manufacturing process (including the production facility, the environmental conditions and the equipment used), the hygiene and sanitation training of staff and the quality monitoring and control procedures. Some factors below are briefly discussed for their regulatory importance. It will almost certainly be time-and cost-saving to consider those aspects from the very early design phases of the product development cycle. \n\n\u2022 Batch-to-batch variation for LBPs differs considerably from batch-to-batch variation in chemical manufacturing processes, with LBPs being known to represent a rather complex case. Specific parameters important for biologicals have been published by Jenzsch et al. 16 , who describe a number of parameters able to improve batch-tobatch reproducibility in microbial cultures, albeit focusing on recombinant protein production. The authors describe two main engineering challenges. As mentioned above, it is essential to define a robust operational procedure with the given constraints and expected variants following expected process fluctuations. In regulatory terms, it is important to \"identify and describe the process attributes (critical parameters) that can influence batch reproducibility, product performance and drug product quality\" 7 . Second, when executing this process, all other random fluctuations or disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control systems. Without these controls, the reproducibility of biomass cultivation might not be very high, a fact recognized by the FDA 16 , which advises developers to (i) define science-based principles and tools supporting manufacturing innovation and (ii) provide a strategy for regulatory implementation that will accommodate innovation, including tools for real-time automated process monitoring and control. Therefore, the early-stage modeling of possible process variations can have an important role in quality improvement, given that random fluctuations or disturbances are also efficiently addressed during the real manufacturing process.",

            "text": "Host cell protein (HCP) release during the production of therapeutic proteins is a critical quality attribute that must be monitored and reduced to acceptable levels during the production of a biotherapeutic protein. 1 Being able to control HCP release during harvest, and their removal via downstream processing, is thus an important component of the manufacturing of such molecules and must be reported to the regulatory authorities. Typical purity targets for a monoclonal antibody (mAb) are <100 ppm HCP, <10 ng/dose DNA, and <5% product aggregates. 2 Some HCPs are known to be co-purified with the recombinant protein target, while others, specifically proteases, are reported to lead to product degradation. 3 As a wide range of recombinant products are negatively affected by the presence of proteases such as reported for mAbs, 4 fusion proteins, 5 coagulation factors 6 and based on personal communication with BioMarin who have manufacturing experience of GAA therapeutic enzyme products, we suspect GAA in certain conditions to also be similarly potentially affected.\n\nExpression of therapeutic proteins from mammalian cell platforms presents multiple challenges associated with removal of both product related and host cell derived (e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids) impurities. It is believed that stress resulting from protein overexpression causes morphological changes to cell structure and an increase in HCP released, which can impact on downstream processing. As widely described in the literature, HCPs in final drug formulation can potentially have an impact on drug toxicity and patient safety. 7 In addition to target molecule overexpression, another factor that can have an impact on cell stress is the high local energy dissipation rate associated with bubble bursting during culture, particularly in stirred bioreactors. A recent paper 8 describes how cell death and lysis cause HCP release in the broth throughout the duration of the culture and are critical process parameters difficult to track as cell counters cannot account for lysed cells. The cell viability, cell size and choice of harvest day all therefore contribute to total HCP released due to shear during primary recovery. 9 Historically, immunoassay-based techniques such as ELISA have been used as high throughput methods to quantify HCP amounts during process development, manufacturing and in final product formulations.

            "text": "The product quality and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of antibodies obtained with batch and on-demand reconstituted media were identically measured using sheathless CE-MS (Figure 9). 9). The glycosylation pattern between continuous on-demand and batchwise reconstitution showed only minor differences that are within the expected batch to batch variations for pharmaceutical mAb production (Planinc et al., 2017;Upton et al., 2019). Importantly, we did not observe significant differences in the levels of afucosylation (Figure 9). The amount of afucosylation is an important CQA because it leads to a high ADCC activation (Ferrara et al., 2006;Li et al., 2017). Regarding other PTMs no differences were observed between the two evaluated conditions. Summarizing, using the device for a continuous on-demand reconstitution, we were able to continuously prepare medium for 12 h with a reconstitution rate of 0.475 L h \u22121 . By operating at the lower limits of our miniaturized 3D developed device (19 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 cm), we could theoretically supply continuous on-demand fresh medium for a 15 L perfusion bioreactor with a working volume of 10 L operating at 1 VVD. In addition, we believe that a nonintegrated stand-alone version of our developed system similar to already existing automated buffer preparation units could also substantially contribute to the reduction of preparation and storage costs of cell culture media (Carredano et al., 2018;Gibson et al., 2019). The trend of outsourcing media and buffer preparation increased in the last decade, and we believe that an on-demand reconstitution directly from solids would position itself on the biotherapeutic manufacturing and supplier of process materials side and by that reduce the logistical pressure (Langer, 2016). As the developed device is also easily scalable, we offer a flexible solution for large scale media preparation but also to make continuous processes such as the perfusion technology more easily available for existing fed-batch facilities (Lin et al., 2017); thus, extending the continuous idea into the auxiliary equipment's of buffer and media preparation (Figure 10).",

            "text": "Multivariate interactions between process parameters can heavily impact product quality and process performance in biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Thus, multivariate interactions should be identified and appropriately controlled. This article describes an in-silico approach to establish multivariate acceptable ranges; these ranges help to illustrate the combined impact of multiple input variables on product quality and process performance. Additionally, this article includes a case study for a monoclonal antibody polishing application.Proven acceptable ranges are set by changing only one input parameter at a time while keeping all others constant to understand the impact of process variability on product quality or process performance, but the impact of synergistic variables are not evaluated. Within multivariate acceptable ranges, any combination of input parameters of a unit operation yields the desired product quality and process performance. The layered approach applied in this article is based on risk assessment and statistical models to leverage prior knowledge and existing data. The risk assessment is specific for a manufacturing facility but is applicable to multiple products manufactured in the same facility. No additional wet-lab experiments are required for building the statistical models when development and process characterization are executed using a design of experiments approach, compared to a univariate evaluation of data. The established multivariate acceptable range justifies revised normal operating ranges to ensure process control. Further, the determination of multivariate acceptable ranges adds to overall process knowledge, ultimately supporting the implementation of a more effective control strategy.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and derived products such as antibody-drug conjugates, Fcfusion proteins and antibody fragments, are widely used in many diagnostic and therapeutic applications [1]. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most commonly used host for industrial mAb production, accounting for 84% of currently approved products [2]. mAb yield increased from 50 mg/L in 1986 to 3-10 g/L in 2010s as a result of a variety of genetic and process optimisation techniques that led to increased cell density and specific mAb productivity [3][4][5]. However, achieving higher cell densities has also led to the accumulation of cell-derived impurities over culture duration, posing challenges for downstream separation [6,7]. \n\nHost cell proteins (HCPs) are a heterogeneous mixture of proteins secreted by viable cells and intracellular proteins released from dead and lysed cells toward the end of the culture [7]. \n\nIn their majority, HCPs are removed in the downstream step of protein A affinity chromatography, however, some persist after this unit operation and their removal requires further chromatographic separation steps [8]. Certain HCPs have proteolytic activity and can cause product fragmentation (and subsequent aggregation) while others can lead to immunogenic responses in patients if not fully removed [6]. The concentration and properties of residual HCPs present in process intermediates and the drug product are therefore of significant interest [9,10]. \n\nHCP concentration typically increases with cell culture duration and correlates with the number of dead cells, even though HCPs are also known to be secreted by viable cells [6,11]. Although the goal of upstream operations has typically been to increase yield, which often involves improved feeding regimes to increase culture longevity, this is not necessarily beneficial from the point of view of downstream processing effort and cost. The ability to quantify the trade-off between increased yield and raised purification effort could therefore support decision-making during process development, such as optimal harvest time. Including the level of impurities in upstream process models paves the way for multi-objective optimisation of both upstream processing steps and the entire flowsheet to reduce the process development and manufacturing cost of therapeutic proteins and increase overall process efficiency.",

            "text": "The field of bioprocess development for mAb production finds itself at a crossroads resulting from significant changes in multiple factors impinging on process design targets. The combination of excess production capacity and increasing cell culture titers enables simple strategies and platform processes to meet market demand for nearly all mAbs in the development pipeline, and enjoy sufficiently low production costs resulting in drug substance COGs not being a key process design driver. This could lead to a frameshift in process development strategies, and a slowing of the relentless march to develop processes with higher and higher titers. The new paradigm would suggest that if acceptable standards of productivity and COGs are met, then one should not make process design decisions based on perceptions of capacity limits, purification bottlenecks, or COGs pressures for anything but the most unusual situations (noting that clinical production drivers could be different). processing and toxin costs will be significant. Product titer is still a key element of COGs for recombinant proteins that require relatively large doses like mAbs.\n\nA focus on product quality and process consistency should be the first consideration for process development groups, and would reinforce the use of established and well-characterized production technologies. The confidence in delivering product with an acceptable set of critical quality attributes that will meet the target product profile are likely maximized when conventional unit operations are employed. This type of focus is even more important for non-mAb recombinant proteins, where variation in product quality attributes is typically less well-understood or controlled.\n\nNovel purification technologies may need to be uniquely enabling in order to make inroads into mAb processes. Modest cost reduction or perceptions of debottlenecking may have little practical value, and never recover the significant investment in development, scale-up and validation. The benefits may not sufficiently reward the acceptance of potential risks involved with being the first to adopt new technologies, and reliance on single source vendors who are also producing new separations media for the first time.\n\nIn considering adoption of new process technologies that would include royalty payments based on use for production of commercial products, the royalty costs could easily dominate the total COGs given the process economics described above (a 1% royalty on sales for the median mAb would be $80/gm, potentially more than the fully loaded drug substance COGs). Conventional technologies in the public domain are likely to remain the more attractive option, unless new technologies",

Although biological variations are difficult to tackle due to the complexity of the products, in-process human variation must be addressed to ensure consistent product quality. Indeed, automated pipetting, for example, can timely, accurately, repeatedly, and consistently perform liquid handling, including mixing and transferring of liquids, reducing variability within and between batches. Automation of monitoring processes (e.g., advanced algorithmic approaches, such as machine learning, coupled with image acquisition and processing) eliminates the need of subjective human judgments (e.g., cell morphology assessment, confluency assessment) further enhancing control over reproducible product development. As cell-based therapies are maturing, it is imperative to standardize and control manufacturing engineering strategies and implement robust automation and process monitoring and control for safety (above all), consistency and reproducibility purposes (Ball et al., 2018;Hunsberger et al., 2018;Pigeau et al., 2018;Moutsatsou et al., 2019).

            "text": "ABSTRACT During large-scale monoclonal antibody manufacturing, disulfide bond reduction of antibodies, which results in generation of low molecule weight species, is occasionally observed. When this happens, the drug substance does not meet specifications. Many investigations have been conducted across the biopharmaceutical industry to identify the root causes, and multiple strategies have been proposed to mitigate the problem. The reduction is correlated with the release of cellular reducing components and depletion of dissolved oxygen before, during, and after harvest. Consequently, these factors can lead to disulfide reduction over long-duration storage at room temperature prior to Protein A chromatography. Several strategies have been developed to minimize antibody reduction, including chemical inhibition of reducing components, maintaining aeration before and after harvest, and chilling clarified harvest during holding. Here, we explore the use of hydrogen peroxide in clarified harvest bulk or cell culture fluid as a strategy to prevent disulfide reduction. A lab-scale study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in preventing antibody reduction using multiple IgG molecules. Studies were done to define the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide needed to avoid unnecessary oxidization of the antibody products. We show that adding a controlled amount of hydrogen peroxide does not change product quality attributes of the protein. Since hydrogen peroxide is soluble in aqueous solutions and decomposes into water and oxygen, there is no additional burden involved in removing it during the downstream purification steps. Due to its ease of use and minimal product impact, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide treatment is a powerful, simple tool to quench reducing potential by simply mixing it with harvested cell culture fluid.",

            "text": "Recombinant monoclonal antibodies are heterogeneous due to post-translational modifications (PTMs) and physico-chemical transformations that could occur during their entire life-span. Understanding of the mechanisms and the ways to control the heterogeneity are essential to the successful clinical development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics. Based on International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q6B, mAb variants can be classified as either \"Product-related substances\" or \"Product-related impurities\". Product-related substances are defined as \"Molecular variants of the desired product formed during manufacturer and/or storage which are active and have no deleterious effect on the safety and efficacy of the drug product. These variants possess properties comparable to the desired product and are not considered impurities.\" Product-related impurities are defined as \"Molecular variants of the desired products (e.g., precursors, certain degradation products arising during manufacture and/or storage) which do not have properties comparable to those of the desired product with respect to activity, efficacy, and safety.\" Therefore, mAb variants are required to be thoroughly characterized to determine their chemical nature and impact on stability, activity, efficacy, and safety. \n\nBecause process changes are inevitable during process development, optimization and scale-up, a thorough understanding of mAb variants is also critical to demonstrating comparability between batches. The acceptance criteria to establish comparability for product-related impurities are more stringent than that of product-related substances (ICH Q5E). Failure to demonstrate the presence of tag to label N-terminal primary amine in combination with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), an mAb variant with the loss of one amino acid from the light chain was observed [11]. \n\nNatural IgG contains approximately 1.8-mole pyroGlu/mole IgG [6]. Based on the different reaction rates, it is expected that most of the pyroGlu originates from N-terminal Gln, rather than Glu. Assuming that the stress condition for massive production of mAbs from ex vivo expression in host cell lines is the cause of N-terminal signal peptides and truncation, they are not expected to occur and have not been reported for natural IgGs.",

However, USP at low productivity is more costly than downstream process. Furthermore, the innovative technologies are implemented in purification processes to address the \"downstream bottlenecks\" which allows easy handling of high titer volume in a production process. Innovation in manufacturing processes helps in driving the improved production cost, flexibility, and product quality which is ultimately beneficial to the end-users. These innovative technologies include: (1) Use of single-use systems in upstream and downstream processes, (2) Continuous manufacturing/process intensification to reduce the manufacturing footprint and economical production, (3) Alternative purification processes such as membrane chromatography for an efficient purification, and (4) Implementation of Quality by Design (QbD) approach for a successful and economical process development (Figure 1) (Strube et al., 2014). \n\nThis review summarizes the innovative approaches in cell line development, upstream and downstream processes including use of a single-use holistic process and facility for efficient bacterial, yeast and mammalian based recombinant product development. We also discussed that how the implementation of the QbD approach in both the processes ensures consistency in the process as well as product quality.

            "text": "Materials and methods AmbrTM 48 and 80L stirred tank bioreactor were run for 14 days in a fed-batch mode in a chemically defined medium. A CHO cell line expressing a recombinant monoclonal antibody (MAb) was used. Feed was added daily from day 3 onwards. If required, antifoam C was added to the bioreactor. DO, pH, and temperature were controlled at setpoint. Viable cell concentration (VCC), cell viability, and average cell diameter were measured using a ViCell cell counter. Osmolality was obtained using an Osmometer (Advanced Instruments). On harvest day, MAb concentration of the supernatant samples was quantified using Protein A high performance liquid chromatography. For the minibioreactors run, triplicates were pooled on harvest day for product quality attributes analysis. For both scales cell culture fluid samples were centrifuged and filtered to remove cell debris. The monoclonal antibody was purified by AKTAXpress (GE Healthcare) Protein-A purification. The neutralized eluate was used for product quality analysis. Results High throughput technologies enable us to interconnect clone and process development thus reducing the risks associated with early-stage process development while reducing timelines and enabling us to achieve higher process robustness in a leaner manner. In one ambrTM48 run different feeding strategies were assessed on 4 preselected lead clones for selecting the final lead clone, the fed-batch feeding strategy and additional data with feed compositions all at once. The selected condition (clone, type of feed and feeding strategy) was based on the maximization of the MAb titer and target High Molecular Weight Species (HMWS) level and Acidic Peak Group (APG) level (data not shown). Scale up from ambrTM 48 to 80L stirred tank bioreactor was performed with the selected clone, feed and feeding strategy. Similar cell growth profiles were obtained at ambrTM scale and 80L scale for the selected condition (Figure 1). Monoclonal Antibody titers and percentages of Acidic Peak Group obtained at harvest day were comparable between scales (Table 1). Process robustness was shown by performing a number of 4 batches at 80L scale.",

            "text": "Different avenues of LV manufacturing platform are covered in our review (Perry & Rayat, 2021). A typical LV manufacturing route is described in Figure 1a: note the multiple membrane processes (i.e., clarification, concentration/diafiltration and sterile filtration) often utilized alongside chromatography as the main purification step. Due to their lipid enveloped structure, the stability of LVs is thought to be influenced by temperature, freeze-thaw, ionic strength, adsorption, pH and shear stress experienced during the manufacturing steps. The mechanism of LV loss through these stressors is yet to be fully investigated (Moreira et al., 2020). Although some stability studies have been performed in the past (e.g., Dautzenberg et al., 2021;Tijani et al., 2018), these have focused on chemical and thermal stability rather than on the individual unit operations and their interaction. In the field of recombinant protein production, including macromolecular therapies, understanding the interactions between the product and the unit operations has led to improvement of yields, reduction in cost and development of a robust purification strategy (Huisman et al., 2000;Zydney, 2021). The systematic study of LV manufacturing condition, the unit operations and their interactions (i.e., whole bioprocess analysis) is currently a gap in vector manufacturing. The low recovery and loss of vector functionality, as well as the differences in quality requirements (i.e., purity and potency) for in vivo and ex vivo applications are key challenges in LV production (McCarron et al., 2016). The latter requires product and process review on a case-by-case basis (McCarron et al., 2016) while the former (i.e., LV losses) can be addressed by rational bioprocess development for the fundamental study and understanding of LV bioprocessing (Perry & Rayat, 2021). Bioprocess investigations at the earliest opportunity during product development would enable the design and creation of robust LVs for manufacture. \n\nIn this regard, scale-down bioprocess models mimicking manufacturing operations and high throughput studies could prove beneficial.",

            "text": "The biomanufacturing industry has developed several innovative treatments for cancer, adult blindness, and COVID-19 among many other diseases. Despite its increasing success, biomanufacturing is a challenging production environment. Different from classical pharmaceutical manufacturing, biomanufacturing methods use living organisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, or mammalian cells) during the production processes. These living organisms are custom-engineered to produce highly complex active ingredients for biopharmaceutical drugs. However, the use of living organisms also introduces several operational challenges related to batch-to-batch variability in the production outcomes. \n\nThe drug substance manufacturing can be broadly categorized into two main steps: fermentation and purification operations. During the fermentation process, the living organisms grow and produce the desired active ingredients. Specific characteristics of active ingredients (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, biomass, proteins, antigens, etc.) could vary across different drugs. In the remainder of this paper, we refer to the resulting target active ingredient as protein. \n\nAfter fermentation, the batch continues with a series of purification operations to comply with stringent regulatory requirements on safety and quality. Our main focus in this study is the fermentation process. \n\nThe fermentation process is typically carried out inside a stainless steel vessel called bioreactor. Bioreactors are equipped with advanced sensors to achieve a highly controlled environment via monitoring of critical process parameters (e.g., cell growth rate, protein accumulation, impurity accumulation, etc.). Figure 1 uses industry data to illustrate the main dynamics of a batch fermentation process. As the fermentation continues, we observe from Figure 1(a) that the amount of protein produced during fermentation increases exponentially over time. Hence, this specific phase of fermentation is known as the exponential growth phase. However, the exponential growth phase continues only for a finite period of time (e.g., several hours or days depending on the application) because of the inherent limitations of biological processes (e.g., limitations in media, cell viability, and growth). After the exponential growth phase, the fermentation enters a stationary phase in which the protein production stops and the batch needs to be harvested.",

With this quality-associated analytical platforms, the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, heterogeneity, affinity, ligand-binding ability, glycan structures, and other characteristics of mAbs would be quantitatively evaluated. These values from the quantitative methods provide a Protein & Cell comprehensive and matrixed package for multiple lots of products accumulated during the preclinical and particularly clinical developmental phases. Such a working database on the product would enable future comparability exercise in support of process upgrade or scale up to support expanding markets or alternative production facility. \n\nIn addition to traditional mAb products, there are other forms of mAb-based biologics such as antibody-drug conjugations and bi-specific antibodies. The principles of analysis for these molecules are generally consistent with those of the traditional mAbs, but there are several specific attributes that must be designed, such as the stoichiometry between IgG and the drug or the \"drug-to-antibody ratio\" and \"drug distribution\" for the antibody-drug conjugations (Hamblett et al., 2004;Wakankar et al., 2011), among others. \n\nAs one can imagine, with the development of analytical technology, the characterization of mAbs will becomes more precise, systematic and even more important, not only for the development of future mAb products but also for evaluation of biosimilar mAbs. Nevertheless, the concept of quality by design (QbD) should be used during the development of therapeutic mAbs (Finkler and Krummen, 2016;Kelley, 2016). Based on the pre-establishment of target product quality profile, developers could identify the critical quality attributes by the design of experiments, and then determine the workspace in bioprocessing with the critical process parameters. The combination of different analytical methods is used to monitor the product quality in different stages of the bioprocessing as well as in the formulated products.",

            "text": "The development of in vivo gene therapies using viral vectors shows auspicious treatment options for various genetic diseases with high unmet medical need. Among the most prominent gene delivery vectors are recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors. Their potential is reflected in the rising numbers of these molecular entities already approved or being evaluated in (pre-)clinical studies due to the permanence of gene expression, a broad range of tissue tropisms and low immunogenicity [1,2]. Despite intense research and development efforts, process and mechanistic understanding of rAAV manufacturing is limited compared to well-established biopharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies [3,4]. In this context, hurdles with regard to low yield and purity during bioprocessing as well as varying potency of the final product are yet to be resolved to ensure reproducible, safe, and efficient production of rAAV-based gene therapies [3]. An important step towards understanding and controlling these aspects involves improved knowledge of the manufacturing process itself. Generally, a process is considered well-understood when all allegedly critical sources of variability are identified and can be controlled to meet consistently the quality target product profile. Furthermore, in a well-understood process, quality attributes should be predictable based on process knowledge with sufficient accuracy and reliability over the design space conditions for risk-based process control [5]. \n\nTo this end, process analytical technology (PAT), as outlined by the FDA initiative first published in 2004, and further adapted within the ICH guideline Q8 (R2), can be understood as a systematic approach to establish and monitor critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) for (bio-)pharmaceutical manufacturing. Ultimately, the goal of PAT is to enable real-time process monitoring and control, thereby achieving consistent product quality and hence ensuring patient safety. Additionally, the benefits of implementing PAT tools are an enhanced product and process understanding by exploiting the vast number of generated data, and the prospect of improved productivity and minimized risk of batch failures. Eventually, these optimizations can contribute to a positive environmental impact and cost efficiency [5].",

            "text": "There is an increasing demand to improve the overall sustainability of the biopharmaceutical industry. A barrier to improvement has been the limited research undertaken in the area of environmental impact of key design decisions. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of buffer management strategy and technology selection on overall process efficiency using process mass intensity (PMI) as a metric for comparison. The environmental impact of buffer management has yet to be fully understood, despite buffers being one of the most resource-intensive aspects of biopharmaceutical manufacturing. A detailed process model was used to evaluate the impact of buffer management on a monoclonal antibody (MAB) process at the 2000 L scale. This was achieved by means of a non-replicated full factorial design composed of six variables: product titre, quantity of unique buffers, preparation frequency, single-use threshold and equipment cleaning duration with two levels and buffer preparation strategy type with four levels. The study identified that buffer management has a critical impact on overall process mass intensity, demonstrating a possibility to achieve a reduction in PMI of up to 90% for the best scenario compared to the worst. The findings also indicated that single-use systems are greatly superior to stainless-steel systems in terms of overall process efficiency, which is consistent with established thinking. The results from this research represent a further significant step towards achieving a more sustainable biopharmaceutical industry, establishing buffer management as a critical focus area, quantifying the influence of key variables on process mass intensity and highlighting the benefits of using a process mass intensity metric as part of routine biopharmaceutical design.",

Low-pH VI in periodic batches or continuous plug-flow reactors are in general the methods of choice for postcapture antibodies (Coffman et al., 2021). Changing a process from batch to continuous purification leads to similar product quality attributes, as revealed by a comparability study using similar parameters in both process modes (David et al., 2020). This will pave the way to adapt batch processing for clinical trial production to continuous large-scale production. \n\nThe implementation of an ICB requires the full automation and control of the upstream and downstream systems.

Orbit saves user specifications, information about the downstream sequence, process events, signals, and data, thus allowing real-time control and automation of all downstream units centralized in a single control system.

            "text": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the mammalian workhorse of the biopharma industry. They are extensively used for recombinant protein production, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAb) [1,2]. Classical recombinant protein production is usually carried out with bacterial (e.g. E. coli) or yeast cells (e.g. P. Pastoris) but complex protein molecules, which have several post-translational modifications to function properly as a medicine, require mammalian host cells [3]. However, these cells are more sensitive to cultivation parameters than the above-mentioned bacterial or yeast cells because they do not possess a cell wall that reinforces the cells. Therefore, strict monitoring and control of the cultivation parameters is mandatory to ensure process reproducibility and the desired product quality [4]. In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the guidance of process analytical technology [5] that encouraged the manufacturers to use on-line measurement techniques to monitor and control the cultivation parameters. The concept of process analytical technology was shortly followed by quality by design that emphasized the designing of processes with systematic experiments (i.e. Design of Experiments) to discover the behaviour of the processes according to a set of different cultivation parameters. The parameters that are proven to affect the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the protein product are the critical process parameters (CPPs) that have to be monitored and controlled during the process to ensure the desired product quality. \n\nGlucose is the main carbon and energy source of the cells that is consumed during the cell cultivation process and then turned into biomass and the product [4,6]. However, the availability of glucose to the cells influences several CQAs because it could alter cell metabolism [7]. Thus, glucose concentration is usually a critical process parameter that is 1 3 generally controlled between 5 and 40 mM during a cultivation process. On the one hand, glucose concentration lower than 5 mM can lead to the starvation of the cells, which beside causing low growth and protein production rate can negatively affect CQAs [8,9]. On the other hand, concentrations higher than 40 mM stimulates cell division but also increases the accumulation of by-products (e.g.",

            "text": "The field of viral vector-based gene therapy has expanded significantly in recent years which translates to over 2000 clinical trials initiated since the 1990s and a drastic rise in commercial initiatives (145). However, this acceleration in the field has been accompanied by challenges associated with viral vector manufacturing capacity, vector characterization and increased regulatory scrutiny (146). Designing and manufacturing viral vectors successfully and consistently is expensive, and requires experienced scientists and high quality control (QC). These challenges have limited the widespread clinical application of gene therapy approaches (147). Viral vector manufacturing involves a variety of approaches, typically using mammalian cells in adherent or suspension systems. However, these systems are challenging to scale up due to the increased supply costs, processing time and batch to batch variation (148, 149). An alternative to overcome these limitations is the use of larger single-use culture systems and bioreactors which is increasingly being adopted in the field (150-154). Another source of variation in vector manufacturing arises from the use of transfection-based methods to generate vectors. Efficient transfection is highly dependent on the appropriate combination of transfection reagents, pH and plasmid DNA, and is highly susceptible to batch-to-batch variation. When scaling up for clinical manufacturing, this poses a significant barrier to producing consistent results with low lot-to-lot variability (155)(156)(157)(158). Moreover, the transition of gene therapy approaches from pre-clinical animal studies to human clinical studies has prompted extensive characterization and QC testing of recombinant viral vectors to ensure batch-to-batch consistency. However, one of the limitations to characterizing and QC testing of viral vectors is their inherent degree of complexity. AAV, one of the smallest and simplest of recombinant viral vectors is significantly more complex than the most complex recombinant protein. Retroviral vectors are more complex with a double-stranded genome and a lipid bilayer encapsulating the capsid (146, 159). Thus, methods for characterizing viral vectors need to be customized for each different viral vector and each serotype. \n\nCell-based (ex vivo) gene therapy offers a different set of problems such as high sensitivity to environmental factors and intrinsic biological variability.",

            "text": "Abstract The pharmaceutical industry employs various strategies to improve cell productivity. These strategies include process intensification, culture media improvement, clonal selection, media supplementation and genetic engineering of cells. However, improved cell productivity has inherent risk of impacting product quality attributes (PQA). PQAs may affect the products\u2019 efficacy via stability, bioavailability, or in vivo bioactivity. Variations in manufacturing process may introduce heterogeneity in the products by altering the type and extent of N-glycosylation, which is a PQA of therapeutic proteins. We investigated the effect of different cell densities representing increasing process intensification in a perfusion cell culture on the production of an IgG1-\u03ba monoclonal antibody from a CHO-K1 cell line. This antibody is glycosylated both on light chain and heavy chain. Our results showed that the contents of glycosylation of IgG1-\u03ba mAb increased in G0F and fucosylated type glycans as a group, whereas sialylated type glycans decreased, for the mAb whole protein. Overall, significant differences were observed in amounts of G0F, G1F, G0, G2FS1, and G2FS2 type glycans across all process intensification levels. G2FS2 and G2 type N-glycans were predominantly quantifiable from light chain rather than heavy chain. It may be concluded that there is a potential impact to product quality attributes of therapeutic proteins during process intensification via perfusion cell culture that needs to be assessed. Since during perfusion cell culture the product is collected throughout the duration of the process, lot allocation needs careful attention to process parameters, as PQAs are affected by the critical process parameters (CPPs). Key points \u2022 Molecular integrity may suffer with increasing process intensity. \u2022 Galactosylated and sialylated N-glycans may decrease. \u2022 Perfusion culture appears to maintain protein charge structure.",

            "text": "Data sets acquired over different time ranges pose additional challenges for adaptation to the real-time process monitoring and control that are desired for continuous manufacturing. Process parameters monitored in real time may be fed to models, empirical or otherwise, to predict key CQAs such as the glycosylation pattern [145][146][147] during the cell culture process. For example, glycosylation may be modulated through parameters such as amino acids, 148 manganese, 23,149 ammonia, [150][151][152] glycosylation precursors, 153,154 and other additives 146,155 in the cell culture media. Control strategies implemented in cell culture include the use of dielectric spectroscopy 156 and focused-beam reflectance 157 probes for viable cell-density measurement. In purification, many use UV-based control strategies for loading onto continuous chromatography set-ups. 60,158,159 Recently, a NIR flow cell has been integrated with a continuous SMB system for monitoring and control of mAb loading for product capture. 160 xtension of process monitoring and control across the entire manufacturing train is critical to ensure successful continuous operation. For complete process integration, global control strategies should be implemented to assess the impact of upstream process conditions on downstream productivity, requiring elimination of the dichotomy between upstream and downstream processes. For example, upstream processes are currently optimized for higher titer and product quality, while downstream processes consider the removal of lumped measures of aggregates, charge variants and host-cell proteins. Changes in purification processes can alter the content and profile of impurities and product variants, making it desirable to control their generation early in the process. For example, media components 161 and harvest operations 162 have been found to influence the heterogeneities in the impurity 163 and product profiles. 164 Furthermore, inline monitoring of mAb aggregation in cell culture were demonstrated 165,166 to provide relief to purification efforts and improve process yield. Understanding the effect of operational parameters on the final product quality can be leveraged in controlling the process and meeting a target requirement, for example in the case of biosimilars. 12",

            "text": "BackgroundThe bacterium E. coli is a major host for recombinant protein production of non-glycosylated products. Depending on the expression strategy, the recombinant protein can be located intracellularly. In many cases the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs), protein aggregates inside of the cytoplasm of the cell, is favored in order to achieve high productivities and to cope with toxic products. However, subsequent downstream processing, including homogenization of the cells, centrifugation or solubilization of the IBs, is prone to variable process performance or can be characterized by low extraction yields as published elsewhere. It is hypothesized that variations in IB quality attributes (QA) are responsible for those effects and that such attributes can be controlled by upstream process conditions. This contribution is aimed at analyzing how standard process parameters, such as pH and temperature (T) as well as different controlled levels of physiological parameters, such as specific substrate uptake rates, can vary IB quality attributes.ResultsClassical process parameters like pH and T influence the expression of analyzed IB. The effect on the three QAs titer, size and purity could be successfully revealed. The developed data driven model showed that low temperatures and low pH are favorable for the expression of the two tested industrially relevant proteins. Based on this knowledge, physiological control using specific substrate feeding rate (of glucose) qs,Glu is altered and the impact is tested for one protein.ConclusionsTime dependent monitoring of IB QA\u2014titer, purity, IB bead size\u2014showed a dependence on classical process parameters pH and temperature. These findings are confirmed using a second industrially relevant strain. Optimized process conditions for pH and temperature were used to determine dependence on the physiological parameters, the specific substrate uptake rate (qs,Glu). Higher qs,Glu were shown to have a strong influence on the analyzed IB QAs and drastically increase the titer and purity in early time stages. We therefore present a novel approach to modulate\u2014time dependently\u2014quality attributes in upstream processing to enable robust downstream processing.",

            "text": "Background Enhancing throughput of bioprocess development has become increasingly important to rapidly screen and optimize cell culture process parameters. With increasing timeline pressures to get therapeutic candidates into the clinic, resource intensive approaches such as the use of shake flasks and bench-top bioreactors may limit the design space for experimentation to yield highly productive processes. The need to conduct large numbers of experiments has resulted in the use of miniaturized high-throughput (HT) technology for bioprocess development. One such high-throughput system is the ambrTM platform, a robotically driven, mini-bioreactor system developed by TAP-Sartorius. In this study we assessed and compared the performance parameters of ambrTM mini-bioreactor runs to 2L glasses , 80L and 400L stainless steel bioreactors using a CHO cell line producing a recombinant monoclonal antibody. The daily parameters monitored during the cultures were cell growth and cell viability, offline pH and dissolved oxygen, metabolite profiles (glucose, lactate and ammonia) and monoclonal antibody titer. In addition, we compared the product quality attributes (high and low molecular weight species, charge variants) of the clarified cell culture fluid post Protein-A elution generated in the mini-bioreactor run to the larger manufacturing scales. Materials and methods A genetically engineered Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR)-/ DG44 Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line with Methotrexate (MTX) as a selective agent, expressing a recombinant monoclonal antibody was used. Cells were cultivated for 14 days in a fed-batch mode in a chemically defined medium and fed according to process description. Culture systems: Different bioreactor scales were used in this study : ambrTM48 (TAP -Sartorius Biosystems), an automated system with 48 disposable microbioreactor vessels, 2L stirred tank glasses bioreactors with Biostat B-DCUII control systems (Sartorius Stedim), 80L and 400L stainless-steel bioreactors (Zeta).

            "text": "In this last case, a pre-study validation was conducted to prove that the method could deliver quality results following the ICH-Q2-(R1) [18]. \n\nIn addition to the analytical challenges related to the size and complexity of biopharmaceutical drugs, the inherent variability that arises due to their manufacturing process requires monitoring throughout the production process to ensure the safety and efficacy of the finished product. For this, the manufacturing process also needs to be controlled through process validation. In this process, a reasonable range of analytical and manufacturing variability is expected. \n\nDuring the development and manufacture of a biopharmaceutical product, \"in-house\" reference standards are used to support the characterization and traceability of the product's CQAs throughout its life cycle, either between batches or over extended periods. For example, the bioactivity of various biosimilar drugs has been altered due to post-approval manufacturing changes. In such a situation, regulatory authorities could assess this alteration using this type of standard; however, the availability of international standards is an alternative method for the identification of the causes of variation, and determining their clinical significance would be facilitated [19]. For this, regulatory guidelines request that manufacturers monitor and control the CQAs of biosimilar drugs to keep them within appropriate ranges, so that their quality and clinical properties remain consistent over time [20]. To achieve this aim, it is necessary to perform the comparison of different batches to describe and analyze the variability between them. However, it is unclear how great the variability of the analytical method would be, or that experienced in producing the batches. In the majority of previous studies, the analytical method uncertainty was neglected, or its contribution was little in comparison with other sources of variation. We found values from 0.2% in real data studies to 30% in simulation studies [21]. \n\nIn this study, we to control the heterogeneity between batches at the time of manufacture in order to verify whether the batches met specification limits. The estimation of the \u03b2-expectation tolerance intervals based on the variance components to account for both between-batch and within-batch variability was proposed as a specification limit. At this point, the variance components were computed by means of the maximum likelihood method using a linear random model.",

In general, by-product formation can be reduced at low osmolality levels and therefore increase culture viability, longevity, and recombinant protein production. However, higher osmolalities have also been shown to increase productivities (Zhang et al. 2010). Further strategies to reduce unwanted by-products such as lactic acid (mainly acidifies culture) or ammonium (toxic and negatively affects protein glycosylation) are to keep glucose or glutamine concentrations low or directly substitute them with slowly metabolized nutrients such as galactose or glutamate (Altamirano et al. 2001(Altamirano et al. , 2004. Another rather simple strategy to reduce byproduct formation can be realized by reduction of the cell metabolism by lowering temperature and/or pH (Trummer et al. 2006a, b).\n\nOptimization of culture operating parameters is vitally important to obtain high product yields while meeting the quality specifications. Physical (e.g., temperature, gas flow, and impeller speed), chemical (e.g., pH, osmolality, dissolved O 2 and CO 2 , redox potential, and metabolite levels), and biological (e.g., cell concentration, viability, cell cycle, mitochondrial activity, and NADH and LDH levels) parameters can all significantly affect product quality and potency, especially with respect to glycosylation, post-transcriptional modifications, and impurity profiles (Li et al. 2010b). These factors can cause substantial variability during bioprocessing. Little understanding of the sources of variation in mammalian cell culture processes is certainly one of the challenges ahead. Currently, a better understanding of bioprocesses towards ensuring final product quality is driven by the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) process analytical technology (PAT) initiative and possibly links process parameters and reproducibility, culture performance, and product quality (FDA 2004).\n\nDisposable technologies are continuously gaining more importance and are nowadays no longer limited to laboratory scale but are continuously being applied on a larger scale. Compared to traditional stainless steel tanks, single-use bioreactors offer numerous advantages such as lower initial investment costs, an increased reliability, and no validation",

This allogeneic or 'off-the-shelf' business model for cell-based therapies is far more akin to current biopharmaceuticals [26], where the product maintains long-term stability. \n\nConversely, autologous cell-based therapies, where cells are taken from a patient and returned to the same patient, represents a different manufacturing challenge as patient populations must be stratified to control this input variation. Issues surrounding the quality test burden and logistics of personalized (services based) medicine add to the complexity for large scale production and delivery of a cost effective autologous cell-based therapy [27]. Delivery of autologous cellbased products can be complex due to the short term preservation methods used for transport and delivery, for example the shelf life of Provenge, an autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based therapy suspended in Lactated Ringer's Injection solution is only 18 h at 2-8\u00b0C [28]. Several allogeneic therapies in development are also shipped to clinical delivery sites in a noncryopreserved format. This results in the need to maintain a constant level of production, even when clinical demand may vary greatly, as noncryopreserved products typically have a shelf life on the order of future science group \n\nThe translation of cell-based therapies Review days and significant product wastage can occur. This increases overall product cost and requires larger batch sizes to be produced. Considering the range of potential cell-based therapies it is clear that multiple manufacturing models must be evaluated in order to fill the need of both universal (scale up) and personalized (scale out) therapies and control the associated biological variation to achieve a consistent product. \n\nGiven the diversity of cell types, disease indications and delivery pathways it is unlikely that there will be a 'one-size-fits-all' manufacturing platform for cellbased therapies and therefore careful consideration must be given to process selection for commercial production during process definition, development and optimization, prior to clinical development.",

            "text": "Cultured mammalian cell expression systems, particularly Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, are used to manufacture high-value biotherapeutic recombinant proteins (rPs) such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [1]. Although the ability of such cell manufacturing 'factories' to produce rP products has been advanced over the last two to three decades, there is still an interest in further optimising the yields that can be delivered for novel and difficult to express proteins and the quality/homogeneity of the protein product. Two key parameters determining the amount of recombinant protein an expression system generates are (i) the maximum viable cell concentration achieved and the length of time this is maintained (the integral of viable cell concentration or IVC) and (ii) the cell-specific productivity of the cell (qP, or the amount of recombinant protein a cell manufactures per unit time, usually expressed as pg/ cell/day). In this regard, improved growth medium and feeding strategies have resulted in dramatic increases in the maximum viable cell concentration and IVC achievable for mammalian cells in the bioreactor, and this has been associated with extended culture viability and enhanced recombinant protein yields [2]. Indeed, achieving high yields of recombinant protein of a clinically acceptable quality is dependent on a multiplicity of parameters, including the choice of the host expression system, the achieved viable cell mass [3,4], gene copy number [5], site-specific integration [6,7], the cellular processes responsible from gene to protein in the synthesis of the desired product [1,8], the bioreactor environment (e.g. nutrients and oxygen levels) [2,9], the authenticity and homogeneity of the product [10,11] and the yield and success of downstream processing [12,13].\n\nThere are now many reports suggesting that major cellular constraints upon recombinant protein production (rPP) can be post-transcriptional ( [14][15][16]). One such control point is mRNA translation, with many reports having now reported that global and specific mRNA translation is a key parameter influencing rPP yields [14][15][16]. Other reports have suggested that rib",

[3][4][5][6] The biopharmaceutical product quality is also extremely sensitive to changes in the underlying biomanufacturing operating conditions and raw materials. Even a minor variation in bioreactor physicochemical conditions such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (dO 2 ) and cell culture media can lead to significant alterations in different product quality attributes. For example, cell culture pH has been shown to greatly affect multiple quality attributes of the mAbs, including N-glycosylation, 7-10 aggregation, 10,11 and charge variations. 10,12 Therefore, biomanufacturing is highly regulated to ensure the safety and efficacy of biologic products.\n\nIn traditional biomanufacturing, product quality in biopharmaceuticals is evaluated using a quality by testing approach. 13 However, significantly higher wastage (more than 50% in some cases) and the subsequent inability to understand the root cause of inefficient bioprocesses have prompted drug regulators such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) to recommend the adoption of the Quality by Design (QbD) approach. 14 QbD approaches rely on the comprehensive understanding of the product and the associated manufacturing processes where the CQAs of the product and its yield would be viewed as a function of various critical process parameters (CPPs). Bioprocesses are now routinely designed following the QbD paradigm, 15 whereby the CPPs that affect the product yield and CQAs are first identified and the manufacturing process is regulated and monitored accordingly. In QbD, design of experiments (DoE) is first used to conduct experiments in a structured manner with variations in CPPs such as pH, temperature,",

Since the first approval in 1986, nearly 60 antibodies were marketed globally by 2015. 1 In 2016 alone, FDA approved another seven therapeutic antibodies as new molecular entities, representing almost one third of the total new drugs approved in that year. 2 Monoclonal antibodies have been developed mainly for the treatment of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases and oncology indications 3 and, to a lesser extent, the treatment of other diseases such as infectious diseases and neurologic disorders. 4,5 Coincident with further advances in immunotherapy technology and protein engineering, monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing class of therapeutics in the pharmaceutical industry. 6 onoclonal antibodies contain hundreds of amino acids and changes in any one of them could potentially cause decreased efficacy or increased safety concerns. Unlike traditional small molecule drugs, antibodies are much larger (~150 k Da) and are subject to a broad range of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions during cell culture production, purification and storage processes, potentially resulting in protein variants. The most common variants include N-terminal pyroglutamate (pE) formation, methionine (M) oxidation, asparagine (N) deamidation, aspartic (D) isomerization, C-terminal lysine (K) truncation and glycosylation. 7 n addition, post-translational modifications occur naturally in biological systems, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of antibody variants rather than a single pure species. Some of these variants have been reported to cause reduced efficacy or side effects. 8 During manufacturing process development, examples of sequence mutations and terminal peptide truncation have been reported. 9 Thus, it is of high importance to develop robust analytical methods to accurately measure these variants in support of monoclonal antibody manufacturing and finished product characterization. Due to the complex structure and the sophisticated production processes of monoclonal antibodies, the development of analytical methods can be significantly more challenging for antibody therapeutics than for traditional small molecules. The most commonly used tools for the analysis of monoclonal antibodies are charged-based separation techniques, including capillary isoelectric focusing and ion exchange chromatography.",

            "text": "Mammalian cells are routinely used in commercial bioprocesses for the production of biologics including recombinant proteins such as monoclonal antibodies. 1,2 To maintain efficient and consistent production there are a number of critical process parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), agitation, and pressure. 3 The design, optimisation, and strict control of these parameters are critical to the prevention of process collapse in the production of these biologics from mammalian cells. Foam generation during these cultures can arise intermittently as a result of agitation and on demand gas sparging particularly in the presence of higher protein content in the medium. In this study, we considered the detrimental effects of foam generation in mammalian cultures and investigated a system for online monitoring. \n\nIn general, monoclonal antibodies are stable and able to withstand slight variabilities in upstream processing such as harsh pH conditions and even shear during processing. 4 Although this may be the case, the high costs and complexities in antibody production result in a demand for highly efficient, economical production processes which consistently deliver product with a high specificity. 5 It is widely understood that advances in media and cell culture conditions, as well as enhanced feeding strategies contribute significantly toward increases in protein production. 5 Thus, in process optimisation the selection of components which limit or exhibit no negative effects on cell growth and production is of high importance. Although many factors can exhibit detrimental effects on a bioprocess, foaming presents a unique challenge because of the potential for catastrophic effects on the culture. Foam is generated through aeration/gassing or agitation in a process reactor, where bubbles are formed and subsequently sustained by proteins also present in the reactor. 6 Its composition comprises liquid lamellas filled with gas. Foams with a higher liquid content are unstable and subject to a natural collapse in a relatively short space of time. 7 However, polyhedric foams, where lamellae and foam plateau borders are curved and take the form of a polyhedron, are much more stable and are a product of mechanical stresses. 8 0][11] None of these are suitable for real time visual monitoring of foam during a mammalian cell culture bioprocess.",

            "text": "Development of biotechnological processes in general, with a special emphasis on animal cell culture, is aimed at defining bioprocess solutions that warrant high volumetric productivity, batch-to-batch consistency and homogenous product quality at low costs [179]. Walther et al. [180] have recognized two major needs for future biomanufacturing: increased flexibility and reduced cost of goods. Construction of a manufacturing facility still represents the main cost, requiring significant time and capital. The \"village scale\" concept was proposed by van der Weele and Tramper [181], where small-scale production facilities would be desirable from the technological and societal point of view when it comes to solving the global problem of CM supply. Although operational costs for some biotechnological products have decreased considerably, operating expenses remain high for many novel and non-standard products, such as CM. The shift from batch to continuous bioprocessing offers the possibility to minimize the costs of goods and maximize flexibility, with additional benefits including simplified scale-up, standardization and more consistent product quality. This transition has been successfully implemented in many branches of biotechnological production [180], such as in the production of therapeutic proteins [182]. A similar positive framework for continuous processing was given by Fisher et al. [183] for both upstream and downstream processes, with a potential to provide production flexibility, reduce product shortages and variability, simplify scale-up procedures, improve product quality, increase productivity, reduce facility footprints, and reduce overall production costs. However, the commercial implementation of continuous mode of operation or perfusion in mammalian cell culture, as well as in CM production, has not been simple and rapid compared to microbial fermentations due to much smaller processing capacity with much higher product value, more complicated quality standards and stringent regulatory requirements for animal cell culture products [184]. Mammalian animal cell culture can be more difficult to operate and maintain desired bioprocess parameters compared to microbial fermentations due to slower growth rates, complex media systems, and more demanding requirements when it comes to process parameter controls [185].",

            "text": "The virus-derived vector as delivery system lies at the heart of most currently employed forms of gene therapy; without the viral vectors, there is no treatment. These viruses must be custom-made in specialized facilities for each treatment, but manufacturing them is costly and onerous: it requires great expertise and multidisciplinary teams and specialized facilities with stringent conditions both for safety/ containment and demanding production methods, under good manufacturing practice with regard to compliance (GMP) [8].\n\nViral vectors are complex bioproducts with an ordered architecture and are very sensitive to handling and environmental conditions. For these reasons, there are stringent requirements aimed at preserving biological activity during all stages of the manufacturing and delivery process. Then, during the production, purification, storage, and transportation stages, it is necessary to maintain specific rigorous control aimed at minimizing the loss of biological activity, in addition to controls which are common to other bioproducts, such as sterility. This implies that the manufacture of large amounts of a viral vector cannot simply be produced by transferring the know-how and well-stablished procedures developed in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of monoclonal antibodies or recombinant proteins.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of lentivectors for use in humans is becoming the bottleneck in the success of ongoing or planned gene therapy development to be launched in the near future [9]. Indeed, the manufacturing capabilities of the companies to satisfy the short-medium term markets are central to decision-making for backers and investors, who are becoming cautious with regard to biotech firms developing gene therapy products that do not have a secure virus source [9]. Several papers have recently reported the need to succeed in developing a global manufacturing process for lentiviral vectors, driven by a deep understanding of both the product and the process, in order to establish the viral vector product profile and critical quality attributes [10,11]. In addition, lentiviral products require the creation of a worldwide accepted and adopted international standard, suitable for the standardization of trials, in particular quantitation trials related to the potency of the target product, allowing a comparison of cross-manufacturing results for any lentiviral platform [12].",

This, along with robust, reproducible manufacturing processes, will help achieve consistency from dose to dose. Common considerations of robust, reproducible manufacturing processes include the use of well-defined raw materials and methods under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), which is necessary for regulatory approval and batch consistency. In addition to scientific and quality considerations, it is critical to control the cost of goods (COGs) because complex, labor-intensive manufacturing and testing processes that often use expensive raw materials can exceed a cell product's reimbursable value. Consequently, costs that are competitive with both cellular and noncellular therapeutics are indispensable to the widespread adoption of cell therapies. Furthermore, it is necessary to achieve a scale of production that can fulfill product demand. \"Scale-out\" for an autologous product requires the ability to carry out a process of small size many times, whereas \"scale-up\" for an unmatched allogeneic process requires the ability to carry out a process of large size only a few times. A recent article [3] examined and presented the issues specific to autologous cell manufacturing. The focus of this review will be directed at allogeneic models, but many of the principles discussed are applicable to both autologous and allogeneic products.\n\nIn the following sections, we provide a summary of what should be considered to drive a therapy from the research stage to full regulatory approval and commercialization. A critical focus is continuous work toward a full understanding of the cell (or cell population) of interest and the processes used to manufacture the product. Many of the critical factors that characterize a process or product will be established throughout development and may not be defined from the beginning. How will the cells be expanded and manufactured while ensuring retention of potency? How will the product be stored and administered? What lot size (the number of cells per production batch)",

            "text": "the following question: is it possible to eliminate LMW issues through downstream process development? In our previous study, we gained an understanding of in-vitro disulfide bond reoxidation and optimized reoxidation conditions to achieve high antibody purity and high reaction rate on Protein A resin (Tang et al., mAbs, in press). A mathematical kinetic model was built to help predict the reoxidation rate and product purity. In fact, a large body of knowledge exists pertaining to in-vitro disulfide bond reformation. [14][15][16][17][18][19][20] While this prior knowledge provides the basis for use of reoxidation methods in antibody purification processes, 21,22 there are still many questions concerning process performance and product quality. For example, it remains to be seen whether the reoxidation method achieves acceptable product quality attributes, including biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties. Additionally, how implementation of the reoxidation wash might affect the robustness of a given manufacturing process is not known.\n\nIn this study, we examined a reoxidation strategy in the downstream process (specifically during the Protein A step) to rescue previously reduced mAbs. Protein A affinity chromatography has become the standard for antibody platform purification from cell culture medium and has been used widely. [23][24][25][26][27][28] By incorporating the redox system (cysteine/cystine pair) as a wash step during the capture chromatography, we provide an efficient way of producing intact mAb product from the reduced mAb via on-column disulfide reoxidation. The feasibility of integrating the redox wash in the Protein A platform method was assessed by evaluating whether the reoxidation reactivity was sufficient to achieve high product purity and by process performance, to achieve acceptable yield and impurity clearance. The robustness of the on-column reoxidation was assessed using multiple molecules, different load LMW levels, and various downstream process intermediates at bench and pilot scales. Biochemical and biophysical characterizations were performed to demonstrate comparability between the rescued mAb drug substance and the reference material.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are commercially important, high value biotherapeutic drugs used in the treatment of a variety of diseases. These complex molecules consist of two heavy chain and two light chain polypeptides covalently linked by disulphide bonds. They are usually expressed as recombinant proteins from cultured mammalian cells, which are capable of correctly modifying, folding and assembling the polypeptide chains into the native quaternary structure. Such recombinant cell lines often vary in the amounts of product produced and in the heterogeneity of the secreted products. The biological mechanisms of this variation are not fully defined. Here we have utilised experimental and modelling strategies to characterise and define the biology underpinning product heterogeneity in cell lines exhibiting varying antibody expression levels, and then experimentally validated these models. In undertaking these studies we applied and validated biochemical (rate-constant based) and engineering (nonlinear) models of antibody expression to experimental data from four NS0 cell lines with different IgG4 secretion rates. The models predict that export of the full antibody and its fragments are intrinsically linked, and cannot therefore be manipulated individually at the level of the secretory machinery. Instead, the models highlight strategies for the manipulation at the precursor species level to increase recombinant protein yields in both high and low producing cell lines. The models also highlight cell line specific limitations in the antibody expression pathway.",

Especially, novel therapies based on mAbs have become a key interest for clinical application and biomanufacturing since the first clinical approval in approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by today, and many more are in clinical development, proving the still increasing interest in these biopharmaceuticals (Gillespie, 2021). \n\nTherapeutic antibodies are characterized by complex posttranslational modifications to ensure bioactivity and low toxicity of the proteins. Therefore, mammalian cell lines like Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are utilized for the expression of these complex biomolecules instead of microbial hosts (Jayapal et al., 2007;Kim et al., 2012). In contrast to small-molecule therapies, production costs are rather high and antibody-based immunotherapies are still very costly (Hernandez et al., 2018;Donini and Marusic, 2019). To lower costs, novel innovative intensification strategies are necessary. \n\nDiscontinuous process formats like fed-batch (FB) are state of the art for large-scale production of mAbs due to their robustness, simplicity, and reproducibility (Birch and Racher, 2006;Huang et al., 2010). The process can be divided into three consecutives culture stages: the logarithmic phase with exponential cell growth, the stationary phase without cell growth, and the death phase with decreasing cell viability usually due to an increasing number of apoptotic cells. During an FB process, where nutrient limitation is prevented, the transition between these different stages is commonly triggered by the accumulation of inhibitory molecules such as growth inhibitors, by-products, and fragments of lysed cells, which ultimately limit the overall productivity and time span of the process (Ahn and Antoniewicz, 2011;Carinhas et al., 2013;Mulukutla et al., 2019).",

            "text": "The manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies is challenging due to the large number of complex unit operations that need to be undertaken.Biopharma products and processes are characterized by the presence of large number of CQAs and CPPs, respectively.All of these need to be monitored and controlled in order to produce a safe and efficacious mAb product.This complexity is a major impediment to the successful adoption of continuous processing in biopharma manufacturing, despite the significant advantages it offers in terms of process economics and manufacturing capacity.Major challenges in automation, process scheduling, process monitoring, and real-time process correction need to be overcome.Furthermore, CPV requires sophisticated systems for the storage, retrieval, and real-time analysis of data that can handle all the heterogenous sources of data from the process equipment, analytical instruments, in-line sensors, and operator actions, all of which need to be organized and converted from various file formats and locations (such as tabular files, images, spectra, distributed file systems, and run logs).Carrying out all these activities manually, including data logging, organization, monitoring, statistical analysis, process supervision, and real-time control, is not feasible over long continuous campaigns without introducing multiple errors.\n\nThe case study presented in this work is the first end-to-end CPPS for the continuous manufacturing of mAbs.The proposed automated system has been successfully demonstrated to handle process integration, automation, data collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, monitoring, and control, automatically carrying out all these tasks to maintain the process at a steady state, bringing in operators only when corrective measures are required due to unexpected process breakdown.The CPPS includes the functionality of data acquisition followed by real-time data analysis, process monitoring, process supervision and real-time control actions.The system is in line with Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing concepts and enables plug-and-play modules with different unit operations to be linked together via a system of surge tanks and integrated with a control system, virtual data analytics, and visualization tools, as well as the integration of real-time data acquisition with historical data to enable monitoring and control.",

            "text": "Upon cell lysis, intracellular contents are released into the mAb-containing culture fluid, and it has been shown that thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase enzymes act in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to reduce the antibody disulfides. 10 This phenomenon is not typically observed during small scale processing, due to low shear harvest conditions, and riskmitigation strategies have been described for large scale manufacturing where high shear harvest conditions are more frequently encountered. 9 uring development and material supply for an early stage clinical program, mAb X was produced in a fed-batch process at different sites and various bioreactor scales. Some BDS lots were colorless to pale yellow at low and high concentrations, while others exhibited red color of varying intensity when concentrated to > 100 mg/mL. To identify process modifications that would improve color consistency across mAb BDS lots, a three-pronged approach was taken. First, basal and feed media formulations were modified to decrease the concentrations of potential color causing components without affecting productivity or product quality. Second, a small scale process model was developed to elucidate the effect of harvest process conditions and medium components on bulk coloration. Finally, analytical methods were employed to identify medium components that caused the redcolored product. The models and methods were used to assess coloration in mAb X and a second IgG4 product, mAb Y, which had otherwise exhibited consistent, light yellow colored BDS at high concentration under standard processing conditions.",

            "text": "For the case of monoclonal antibody products, our simulations revealed higher Profitability Index for recombinant DNA technology compared to IVT mRNA manufacturing. Although recombinant DNA monoclonal antibodies, due to their inferior potency profile, require higher dose i.e. approximately 10 times that of the IVT mRNA, we find that these elevated mass flow quantities are not reflected analogously on the final production cost. It is furthermore exhibited that IVT mRNA manufacturing demonstrates higher dependencies on raw materials leading to higher end product MSPD values. \n\nFor the study case of antigenic vaccines, recombinant DNA technology demonstrates higher economic performance requiring reduced capital resources, hence the utilisation of bacterial cell factories and the nature of the related downstream processes, ameliorate the use of costly raw material. Moreover, recombinant vaccine manufacturing encompasses proven, well-grounded protocols for both the upstream and downstream process development. Regarding the clinical field, this intervention does not rely on the human body to translate a pro drug to peptides or proteins, unlike the treatments based on IVT mRNA vaccines that stimulate the anticipated immune response only after translation is performed in vivo with all the related risks and pharmacokinetic variations. Whereas demand of supply is stable allowing for planned production, recombinant manufacturing appears advantageous hence it fulfills all the technical and financial expectations delivering proven track records of safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of clinical ambiguity. \n\nWhether large production capacities are required immediately such as in cases of global pandemic outbreaks, IVT mRNA significantly shortens the time required from development to clinical application and from benchtop to scale manufacturing, fostering rapid market penetration. In addition, when product flexibility is required to follow up viral mutations, IVT mRNA manufacturing, due to its synthetic processes and the reduced requirements for installation of large scale production equipment, offers unparalleled advantages. Clinical trials and actual field practice in the future will demonstrate whether mRNA technologies will manage to offer non-inferior therapeutic results compaired to their DNA recombinant established alternatives.",

            "text": "The great demand for high quality and quantity of therapeutic proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies, requires robust and economical manufacturing processes, both upstream and downstream. When bioreactors are scaled up from bench to pilot to production scale (2000-20,000 L), downstream processes must be scaled up accordingly. Equally complicated as upstream processes, scale-up of downstream processes requires more than simply increasing the size and volume of the laboratory equipment. The use of larger piping dimensions, larger filters, different types of pumps, and larger dead volumes can introduce variation to the largescale process. We've limited our description here to common strategies used by the industry to scale up chromatography columns.\n\nChromatography process development is often conducted at lab scales using columns with a bed volume around of 10-20 mL at manufacturing-relevant bed heights, whereas the column bed volumes used in a manufacturing process can be 10,000-fold greater. The scale-up of chromatography operations is usually achieved by increasing the column diameter but maintaining the resin bed height and linear flow rate. This ensures that the residence time is kept the same at all scales of operations. However, linear scale-up of the chromatography column to the manufacturing scale is not always practical for the existing manufacturing facility capability and can often be cost prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the column resin cost and prevent other issues associated with larger-sized columns such as potential column pressure increase and poor column packing homogeneity, multiple-cycle runs with appropriately sized smaller columns for each column chromatography step are often performed at manufacturing scales. However, the number of cycles for each unit operation is limited by the total downstream process time, which should be the same or shorter than the upstream cell culture process time.\n\nSuccessful process scale-up depends on determining, measuring, and monitoring critical scale-independent process parameters, then designing and operating equipment appropriately to deliver those same parameters at larger scales. A scale-up process evaluation from the bench scale to the manufacturing scale can be divided into several stages [122].\n\n1. Initial calculation. It is risky to directly apply the process conditions developed at lab scale to the manufacturing scale that is often 10,000fold greater. Therefore, a multiple-step scaleup evaluation is required. The manufacturing column sizes are chosen with consideration of the cost of the resins",

            "text": "Quan et al. [9] utilized this method of enrichment to identify eight reactive lysines that appeared to have a different susceptibility to glycation. Here, we were able to identify glycation sites and relative abundance without the need to enrich the sample. This allows for an unbiased comparison between samples and allows for the identification of those sites that are glycated over the course of clarified cell culture fluid hold times. \n\nIn another study, Miller et al. [10] looked at a mAb that was highly reactive to glycation, with upwards of 80% of the molecules containing at least one glycation site upon incubation in the presence of glucose. They determined that the bulk of the glycation was occurring at a single site in the Complementarity-determining region. While this modification did not impact potency for this particular molecule, the large lot-to-lot variably in charge variant distribution raised significant process consistency concerns. \n\nWhile glycation can form in the bioreactor, it can also form after harvest as long as sufficient sugar is present. Glycation can also occur outside the bioreactor so long as there is sufficient reducing sugar present. One example would be drug product formulations that contain sucrose which could hydrolyze into its reducing constituents (glucose and fructose). For this reason, Fischer et al. explored the composition of the drug product formulation on mAb glycation levels [11]. They found products stored in sucrose containing formulations to be at no greater risk for protein glycation. \n\nAnother source of variability in overall glycation levels frequently encountered in the manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies is the amount of time between harvest and execution of the capture chromatography step and the conditions under which this material is stored. This time between harvest and capture is defined as the clarified cell culture fluid clarified cell culture fluid (CCCF) hold time and is one of many process intermediate hold times defined as part of the manufacturing process. Process intermediate hold times can be a significant source for product degradation and must be well controlled to ensure product consistency.",

Traditionally, these therapeutic proteins are produced recombinantly using mammalian cells, most commonly from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. These cells are grown in bioreactors, in either batch or fed-batch cultures (O'Flaherty et al. 2020) or perfusion cultures (Santos et al. 2019). During production, these large protein molecules or biologic drugs, also undergo certain modifications that may be critical to their mechanism of action in vivo. These modifications are considered critical quality attributes (CQAs), and one such CQA is the glycosylation, i.e., the addition of carbohydrate chains on specific amino acid residues such as asparagine (N-linked) or serine/threonine (O-linked) of the proteins. N-linked glycosylation in mAbs affects the pharmacological properties such as stability, in vivo bioactivity, George Liang and Chikkathur N. Madhavarao contributed equally to this work. bioavailability and efficacy (Beck and Liu 2019;Higel et al. 2019). Notably, variations in N-linked glycans may occur during production due to variations in the carbohydrate chains (or glycans) (Fisher et al. 2019). This heterogeneity in N-glycans usually occurs between batches due to variations in process parameters, with changes in raw materials used in the cell culture or alterations in the genes of the CHO cell line. Maintaining the product homogeneity is necessary for a mAb to ensure drug safety and efficacy. Two kinds of glycan heterogeneity have been reported, namely (1) micro heterogeneity and (2) macro heterogeneity (\u010caval et al. 2021).",

The apparent divergence of these rate constants between IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies further confirms a previous report that different IgG subclasses may be involved in different preferable disulfide reoxidation pathways. 18 Protein purity is a critical quality attribute that must be controlled for consistent product quality. Disulfide bond reduction in mAbs leads to lower protein purity in manufacturing. It has drawn great attention across industry, and companies have since taken tremendous efforts to understand root causes and develop preventive mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, we propose a rescue strategy, in which reduced disulfide bonds are repaired via reoxidation, is also a viable option to contribute to the overall control strategy in mitigating disulfide bond reduction during the manufacturing process. Through in-vitro experiments, we developed an optimal reoxidation condition to achieve >90% intact purity from the starting material containing <5% intact purity within a 1-hr reaction time. A mathematic model based on all six elementary oxidative reactions was built to provide an accurate prediction of not only final intact mAb purity, but also compositions of each intermediate species. This model can be applied in a manufacturing setting to help achieve high product purity. Furthermore, this model may help us further understand the reduction/reoxidation pathways at a molecular level in a dynamic redox environment. This study provides proof-of-concept that reduced antibody can be reoxidized to form high-purity intact antibody at a higher reaction rate by using an optimal redox system on Protein A resin. Nevertheless, the feasibility and robustness of using this reoxidation strategy in manufacturing process still needs thorough evaluation. An extensive study focusing on developability and manufacturability in downstream process is described in our other report of results from this series of studies (Tan et al., mAbs, in press).",

This cell line offers multiple advantages such as secretion of the recombinant product in the media, high titers and productivity, and a product glycosylation pattern close to that obtained from human cell lines. 7  production cell line is typically obtained by transfection of the host cell with a plasmid carrying the open reading frames coding for the heavy and light chains of the mAb of interest. These open reading frames are inserted in a few loci on one of the 22 chromosomes of the cell line and amplified to multiply the copy number of the two genes of interest. The clone with the best stability, productivity and desirable product quality features such as low aggregation or a specific glycosylation pattern is selected and used to produce material for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety assessments, as well as clinical studies. Purification starts with a primary recovery step where cells and Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as one of the most important classes of biotherapeutics, although development of these molecules is long and arduous. A production cell line must be established, and growth conditions for the cells and purification processes for the product must be optimized. Integration of the appropriate analytical strategies in these activities is the cornerstone of Quality by Design and in-process control approaches are encouraged by the Food and Drug Administration.

            "text": "Mark McCall (Loughborough University, UK) highlighted the challenges in translation of research stage cell therapy into clinical development, particularly scale-up in a GMP facility. The numerous and variable input materials to produce a complex cell-based product of suitable quality involve developing a unique manufacturing model with a novel production process for each new product. McCall discussed how to develop control strategies for complex response profiles. He also reflected on the crucial differences between research lab processes and scaled up manufacturing in a GMP environment, which often include reactor vessel dynamics and temperature control. Increased culture vessel scale for GMP manufacturing requires close attention to culture feeding regime that impacts on cell proliferation rate. To support this McCall explained that quantitative monitoring of bioreactor head space gas (i.e. dO 2 ) and metabolites including glucose and lactate, should be part of the production process for quality monitoring. It was clear that all of these factors could affect the quality of the cell component in the end product and thus it is critical to understanding of input cell quality in relation to process yield. Appropriate quality systems are central to delivery of reproducible product and become additionally significant when dealing with multiple manufacturing sites to ensure integration of standards for cell expansion, differentiation, cryopreservation and characterization. Quantification of cell culture is vital to understand the manufacturing process but is also challenging due to the potential for variation in results between laboratories and different methods. Overall consistency in process development can be promoted by adopting common sources of cells (i.e., master and working cell banks) and key process methodologies such as passaging, preservation and thawing as well as cell counting. Finally, McCall directed delegates to guidance from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) [32] regarding various aspects of risk assessment and process development.",

            "text": "The conventional production of pharmaceutical proteins or other biologics consists of multiple steps from raw materials to finished products. As biologics need to maintain stringent quality control, multiple steps in production facilities compromise the product quality significantly. They also reduce productivity and become prone to human errors, which decrease product efficacy and safety. Moreover, multiple steps in cell processing consume a lot of time, which indirectly increases production cost. To overcome these drawbacks, integrated pharmaceutical production has been attempted by various pharmaceutical companies. One of the significant attempts was made by the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing of pharmaceutical products to fully integrate the cell processing system [50,51]. Another attempt was taken by Genzyme\u2122 for continuous production of pharmaceutical recombinant protein in bioreactors, where cell culture to product isolation and purification was integrated in a single flow [52]. By using this system, they respectively reported successful production of monoclonal antibody as well as highly complex, less stable pharmaceutical protein with consistent product quality, high product output, and low cost. Process integrity is necessary for reducing cumbersome production steps and cutting cost significantly. One such integrated system developed by Johnson & Johnson has recently got FDA approval for largescale HIV drug production [53] that reduces time and cost by one third compared to the conventional batch processing.\n\nSince biologics production for cell therapies require multiple steps, integration of all of the steps will give high product quality and safety, as well as help overcome stringent regulatory requirements. In this context, we will discuss how to integrate some important basic steps of cell manufacturing especially genetic modification, cellular reprogramming, expansion, and differentiation in bioreactors to promote a single-step approach for cell-based therapies (Figure 2).",

            "text": "The manufacturing processes of biologics are complex and involve living systems (e.g., mammalian cell lines, microbial agents, plants, and fungi) and multiple critical processes (e.g., gene isolation, recombinant DNA engineering, and protein purification) which further require high technological expertise to ensure consistency and quality of the final product [21]. The manufacturing process of biopharmaceuticals can be broadly categorized into up and downstream processes. The upstream process is defined as the microbial growth required to produce biopharmaceutical molecules through the transformation of substrates into the desired metabolic products [82]. This involves a series of events such as cell line selection and development, screening and selection of clones, optimization of media, optimization of feed, and process optimization. The number of factors should be considered in these steps such as the selection of host cells and expression vectors, type of process (batch, fed-batch, continuous, etc.) temperature, pH, oxygen supply control, sterilization of materials and equipment, environmental monitoring for microbial contamination, etc. which adds complexity to the overall manufacturing process [83]. Downstream processing includes all steps necessary to purify a biological product from cell culture broth to the final purified product of desired purity and yield [84]. It involves critical stages to capture the target biomolecule and to eliminate host cell-related impurities (e.g., host cell proteins, DNA, etc.), manufacturing-related impurities (e.g. buffers, leached ligands, antifoam, etc.), and product specific impurities (e.g., aggregates, fragments, clipped species, etc.). Each purification step would remove one or more classes of impurities [85,86]. Since the manufacturing performance of cell-based therapies is highly dependent on the quality of the extracted cells, therefore leads to highly variable critical process parameters -critical quality attributes (CPP-CQA) which adds more criticality to designing and implementation of quality by design (QbD) [87]. Bioreactor complexity and interplay between process conditions and cellular metabolism have made mechanistic modeling of bioreactors difficult [88].",

Minimizing media components such as glucose, reduces the production of lactate, but may also affect glycosylation. The first steps in the glycosylation pathway involve the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs). Glycan macroheterogeneity is introduced by variation in site-specific glycosylation with the transfer of the oligosaccharide to the protein. Further modification of the oligosaccharide can occur through processing reactions, where some sugars are removed and additional sugars added. This produces microheterogeneity of the glycan pool. Both macroheterogeneity and microheterogeneity may be affected by fermentation conditions. The objective of this study has been to investigate the effect of variable concentrations of glucose on the glycosylation patterns of a camelid monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and to further evaluate their effect on components of the N-glycosylation pathway.",

            "text": "In recent years, biopharmaceutical products, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and therapeutic proteins derived from biological organisms for the treatment or prevention of diseases, have emerged as top-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market 1 . This trend is attributed to their numerous advantages, such as high specificity and activity 2 . As global pharmaceutical sales are projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2026, biopharmaceutical products are expected to contribute significantly, constituting 37% of the total sales, an increase from 30% in 2020 3 . By 2026, over half of the top 100 best-selling medications are anticipated to be biologics. Within the realm of biological products, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) stand out as the forefront runners in the swiftly expanding market of high-value biologics 4 . The mAb products are manufactured through biotechnological processes within living systems, including microorganisms, plants, animals, or human cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, mouse myeloma (NS0), baby hamster kidney (BHK), human embryo kidney (HEK-293), and human retinal cells 5 . Hence, the cultivation and harvesting of cells responsible for producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient 6 play a crucial role in facilitating the growth and reproduction of cells in quantities sufficient to meet production demands 7 . Continuing this trajectory, the utilization of machine learning models across different phases of monoclonal antibody (mAb) development and manufacturing, including the prediction and monitoring of biophysical properties, cell growth, nutrient, metabolite, and protein concentrations throughout bioreactor cell cultivation processes, is not only gaining popularity but also improving in accuracy 8 . \n\nAccording to Kelley 9 , the attention in cell culture process development has been shifted from solely pursuing the elevated titers to emphasising the control of product quality and process consistency at every stage of the development and across all production scales. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the changes in the culture operating parameters which include physical, chemical and biological parameters. Physical parameters encompass factors such as temperature, gas flow rate, and agitation speed, while chemical parameters encompass dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, pH, osmolality, nutrient and metabolite concentrations.",

            "text": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture is one of the most commonly used platforms for producing recombinant biotherapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 1 Over the past several decades, the volumetric efficiency of industrial CHO cell cultures has increased dramatically, primarily due to enhanced viable cell density and extended viability of the cultures. 2,3 The process conditions used to operate highdensity CHO cultures, however, can result in metabolic stresses. 4 For example, metabolic byproducts can accumulate in fed-batch cultures to levels that inhibit cell growth and harm viability. 5 Further, control over the quality of mAbs in the harvest material has emerged as another potential issue.\n\nReduction of mAb interchain disulfide bonds has been observed at various stages during downstream processing following bioreactor harvest. 6 Studies aimed at identifying the factors that contribute to this phenomenon have largely focused on the role of downstream processing conditions. For example, Trexler-Schmidt et al. 7 attributed antibody disulfide reduction to intracellular reducing enzymes (primarily thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin) that are released when cell lysis occurs due to harsh centrifugation conditions during harvest.\n\nAccordingly, efforts to minimize the formation of low molecular weight (LMW) disulfide reduction products have focused on modifying harvest-related processing steps. One proposed solution is to maintain a highly oxidative environment in the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) through air sparging for the purpose of shifting the equilibrium of reversible redox reactions toward oxidation. 8 Another strategy is to minimize the activity of host cell-derived reducing enzymes by reducing storage temperature, 6,9,10 adding chemical inhibitors (e.g., cystine, copper sulfate, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) or removing cofactors for the enzymes (e.g., metal ions). 7 Less attention has been paid to upstream events, although several studies have identified antibody class, light-chain type, cell line and cell culture process as potentially contributing factors. [11][12][13] Isotopic labeling experiments using dithiothreitol as a reducing agent showed that the disulfide bonds between light and heavy chains were more susceptible to reduction and that this susc",

            "text": "With over twenty products approved by the FDA and hundreds in clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) represent the dominant class of biotherapeutics, with a global market estimated at 140-200 billion dollars by 2022 [1]. These Mab products however are very expensive and unaffordable for people in emerging markets. The biopharmaceutical industry is facing a challenge to reduce the price through reduction in manufacturing costs. With the downstream processing accounting for 50-80% of the cost of goods (COGS) for Mabs [2,3] there is an interest to look into new alternative technologies and process improvements that can reduce the costs [4,5].\n\nThe proteolytic instability of protein and peptide ligand, especially the cleavage of peptide chains at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, during the purification of immunoglobulins from animal plasma might adversely affect the binding activity of the ligands [46,47]. In consideration of these facts, as well as to reduce the ion-exchange interactions that contribute in binding BSA and HCPs [48,49], the arginine residue was replaced by an analogous non-natural and comparatively neutral amino acid, Citrulline. The chromatographic behaviors of the N-terminal acetylated variants were also examined. The influence of the spacer arms, process conditions, and peptide variants was determined by analyzing the chromatographic fraction through sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PicoGreen DNA quantitation and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS).",

            "text": "Purification strategies depend on the nature of the biologic agent and expected impurities. These approaches are guided by the early development of reliable analytical techniques appropriate to the product and to the manufacturing approach. For example, purification of recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies for cGMP manufacture typically involve large-scale chromatography based on multiple isolation principles (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size, and so on). Specific contaminants, such as DNA, endotoxin, viruses from mammalian cell production systems, contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, and the like must be quantified and may require additional specific purification measures to remove or inactivate them. \n\nProblems in refolding or solubility, tendencies to aggregate, and product stability at intermediate holding points can be significant issues in process development for scale-up. These represent key challenges in scale-up from investigator laboratory-generated lots to a potentially suitable scale to allow clinical testing. Additional concerns include subtle degradations of proteins that can lead to undesirable immunogenicity. A major concern is the impact of each additional step on the downstream product, which should be reassessed using in vitro potency assays as well as physicochemical characterization. At major development milestones, selected in vivo models should be reexamined using purified product. \n\nProduction cells must be cGMP qualified and tested for adventitious agents and other contaminants, before initiation of production as well as at end of production. A number of cGMP-qualified cell lines and starting vectors are available commercially at relatively low cost and should be considered for use as raw materials to initiate cGMP seed banks in preference to shared materials of uncertain provenance despite the good intentions of the original provider. In the handling of cell lines, care should also be taken to avoid contamination (e.g., from media components, trypsin, or activities taking place in nearby laboratory space). Postproduction cells can be tested for specific contaminants in the presence of a viral product (e.g., using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]).",

            "text": "The main technical disadvantage of the hybridoma technology is that the difficulty in processing and the issue of hybridoma instability [16,17]. Hybridoma instability issues arises from the fact that there is instability of each lot of cDNA production due to mutations, chromosome losses, the potential effects of process variables on the yield, quality, homogeneity of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) product as well as the short half-life to produce the antibody [18,19]. Due to advances in recombinant DNA technology, antibodies can be engineered by means of combinational approaches making use of antibody phage display libraries, which have been reported to be a strong alternative to the hybridoma technology for antibody synthesis [20][21][22][23]. Antibody phage display technology is fast becoming a key instrument as it is more efficient than conventional hybridoma system owing to the fact that it is easier to maintain and grow bacterial cultures for recombinant antibody production. Furthermore, there is excellent potential in further improving the binding properties of selected antibody by means of protein engineering techniques [23][24][25]. \n\nThis paper proposes a conceptual framework based on the antibody phage display for sustaining monoclonal antibody production, which can play an important role in addressing the aforementioned limitations of the hybridoma technology. Aside from the utilization of phage display technology in the production and characterization of anti-OV antibody on phage particles, this study also makes use of molecular simulation for investigating the antigen-antibody interaction via molecular docking followed by the analysis of their complexation properties by means of molecular simulation. Molecular simulation has been widely shown to be robust and complementary tools in gaining a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of various biological research questions [25][26][27][28]. In this respect, the production of phagemid harboring the sequence of anti-OV antibody was applied for tackling the hybridoma stability issues while the characterization of anti-OV antibody was performed by means of experiments in concomitant with molecular simulation.",

            "text": "Despite the advances geared towards purifying large-scale amounts, technical challenges persist in ensuring no/little contamination by host DNA is present in the vaccine product. To this end, CRISPR/Cas9 might help in eliminating the need of selection makers whose presence in the final product need to be thoroughly checked [134]. \n\nThus, by combining the plant VLP platform with CRISPR/Cas9, the purification process can be simplified to achieve good yields in a faster and cheaper way. \n\nThe assessment of manufacturing consistency includes the evaluation of critical quality parameters and their corresponding attributes: identity, purity, safety, and characteristics (Figure 5). \n\nAfter production and control tests, the uniformity of the products must be assured by validating batches and checking their similarity and, where possible, the consistent antibody response to the produced antigens in preclinical models or during clinical development. Nonetheless, for plant-based systems, the lack of the consistency of transgene expression in different batches and individual plants within the same batch has always represented a barrier for the successful application of the plant-based vaccines. Big improvements on lot-to-lot consistency have been obtained since plant-based vaccines expression technology was introduced almost two decades ago, using optimized conditions for N. benthamiana plants subjected to transient transformation [5,135,136]. Only recently, proof of lot-to-lot consistency of a plant-derived vaccine has been achieved in a clinical trial: three sequential lots of a quadrivalent virus-like particle influenza vaccine (QVLP) produced in N. benthamiana elicited equivalent antibody responses to the targeted hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in a phase III clinical trial. This analysis showed for the first time that a plant produced vaccine can meet the standard criteria for consistency of production [6]. \n\nCRISPR/Cas9, offering the possibility to integrate exogenous DNA in specific sites in a genome and to control the spatial/temporal gene expression, will help further to overcome these consistency issues and, with easy refinements of the production processes, the quality and fulfilment of the requirements of regulatory agencies (i.e., compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use-ICH guidelines) could be easily achieved.",

However, ex vivo, large-scale cell manufacturing requires production platforms enabling costeffective expansion to generate clinically relevant numbers. 1 This prerequisite presents significant challenges that are constrained by current manual, open, small-scale production methodologies/systems. Another impediment to broad clinical use includes the numerous early-stage ATMP candidates which require human operators to undertake critical functions and are driven by academic sites, clinical centers and SMEs which lack resources and expertise to automate and scale manufacturing processes. 2 e use of cell-based manufacturing systems for human medicines has led to successful outcomes in recent decades. Recombinant protein drugs (cytokines/monoclonal antibodies) are produced using various expression systems inserted into immortalized CHO cells, capable of unlimited expansion at scale. A new challenge arises when the therapeutic product is the cell itself rather than its protein product. Cell therapies use expanded nonimmortalized, primary cells with complex biological characteristics, whether autologous or allogeneic. Despite these obstacles, the field has made enormous strides in recent years with many outstanding examples, for example, the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for immune disorders or degenerative conditions such as Crohn's disease and osteoarthritis. More recently, MSCs were tested in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with SARs-CoV-2 infection. 3 e emergence of efficient production systems for clinical grade MSCs using scalable bioreactors has been slow. Current production systems mainly involve laboratory-scale manual processing using flasks or cell factories and the dispersed nature of such manufacturing is associated with exceptionally poor process standardization. 4 Critical process parameters including cell source, media composition, seeding density, passage number, and final dose formulation are highly variable. Additionally, process checkpoints and quality control are not uniformly applied and industry standards for release criteria and potency testing have not yet emerged. Current methods generally require full grade A containment levels for qualification, sterility control and maintenance contributing to the very high costs associated with approval and market entry. \n\nThere is an urgent need for highly efficient automated manufacturing platforms for the production of ATMPs for patient benefit.",

Shorter development timelines may enable new drugs to reach patients sooner and allow biopharmaceutical companies to secure first-to-market status.\n\nFor some classes of molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, platform manufacturing processes have emerged to reduce the time and effort required to develop a manufacturing process for a new molecule. In a platform process, the overall unit operations and order of these operations are standardized. Each new product, therefore, requires only minimal optimization of these steps. Biopharmaceutical pipelines are becoming more diverse, however, and other classes of biologics generally require unique production and purification processes, even for similar molecules (Morrison, 2020). Developing processes for these nonplatform biologics requires significant time and effort, limiting the number of molecules that can be manufactured for nonclinical or clinical use.\n\nWe have previously shown that a holistic approach to process development, coupled with a bench-scale, integrated manufacturing platform, can reduce the time required to produce nonclinical material for a new biologic product to as few as 12 weeks after obtaining a target product sequence . Further improvements to the process development timeline could be possible through the development of predictive or platform approaches to the manufacture of different classes of molecules, particularly in the chromatographic purification.\n\nSingle-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are a class of molecules for which a platform approach could be developed. sdAbs offer the affinity and therapeutic value of conventional antibodies with increased stability and solubility (Arbabi-Ghahroudi, 2017). Their small size (12-15 kDa) allows them to bind to previously intractable targets and their increased stability presents the potential for oral dosage (for intestinal diseases) (Harmsen & Haard, 2007). Significant scientific research has been conducted on sdAbs since their discovery in the early 1990s (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993), and recent events have highlighted the therapeutic potential of this class of molecules.

Therefore, acceleration of this timeline has a direct impact on the delivery of high quality, innovative medicines to patients. A balance must be struck between speed and quality to reach quick and efficient IND approval. For example, the goal of a fast development process with minimal cell screening must be balanced with requirements including high titre, favourable product quality attributes and the maintenance of regulatory compliance. Cell line development is traditionally a lengthy process and it is common to find development timelines exceeding 6 months. Limitations include cellular heterogeneity and the regulatory requirement for high probability and assurance of monoclonality which may require rounds of single cell cloning. In this study we explore approaches to mitigate clonal variation and develop a next generation expression system capable of maintaining quality in an accelerated time frame.

There are three key areas that must be considered to succeed in early drug development: efficacy, safety, and manufacturability. The lack of efficacy in patients is one of the main causes of failure in drug development at the clinical phase. For safety, the limits of safe doses, and the specific potential adverse effects of the drug must be assessed to minimize risks in patients and also to the program development. Safety and efficacy are not the only aspects that must be considered for successful drug development: manufacturability also is crucial. However, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) are among the most underestimated steps of the whole drug development process by start-up companies and small biotechs. O. Favre-Bulle highlighted that it is crucial to demonstrate the quality and consistency of the antibody to be produced, by implementing an agile CMC strategy early in the development process. As an example, he discussed the quality of the cell-line development and characterization.\n\nDr. Raffaella Balocco Mattavelli (Unit Head, International Nonproprietary Names Program and Classification of Medical Products, World Health Organization, Switzerland) presented the recent changes of the international nonproprietary names (INN) for monoclonal antibodies.

After immunizing animals such as mice with the immunogen, spleen cells are isolated, fused with myeloma cells, and then subjected to cell culture. Positive clone cells are selected, expanded in culture, and purified to obtain stable mouse monoclonal antibodies. This method requires the establishment of a large-scale animal facility, incurs high operating costs, and lacks effective control over antibody batch-to-batch variation. Additionally, ethical concerns related to animals may arise in the future. In light of these challenges, researchers have developed genetic engineering antibody technology, wherein DNA recombinant technology and protein engineering are employed to recombine antibody genes. Using efficient cell secretion, genetically engineered antibodies 32 are obtained. This technology is well-established in the industry and involves acquiring the antibody's gene sequence, constructing plasmid expression vectors, and transferring them into expression hosts (such as yeast, mammalian cells, or bacteria) to express and purify specific types of recombinant antibodies. It not only enables the production of full-length antibodies but also various antibody fragments such as scFv, Fab, and others. \n\nIn summary, the development of monoclonal antibodies revolves around the discovery of antibody sequences, which is carried out by the upstream animal immunization and the downstream antibody recombination, resulting F I G U R E 1 Three critical phases of antibody discovery: i) superficial cognition: manually (Elisa) discovers effective cells from a pile of cells; ii) deep cognition: identification of functional genetic material within a pool of genetic substances; iii) comprehensive cognition: epigenetic screening combined with genetic material mining. \n\nin the physical presentation of monoclonal antibody raw materials (Figure 1).",

However, this has been accompanied by an increase in product-related impurities and therefore greater challenges in subsequent clarification and capture operations. Considering the paradigm shift towards the design of continuously operating dedicated plants at smaller scales\u2014with or without disposable technology\u2014for treating smaller patient populations due to new indications or personalized medicine approaches, the rising need for new, innovative strategies for both clarification and capture technology becomes evident. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) is now considered to be a feasible unit operation, e.g., for the capture of monoclonal antibodies or recombinant proteins. However, most of the published work so far investigates the applicability of ATPE in antibody-manufacturing processes at the lab-scale and for the most part, only during the capture step. This work shows the integration of ATPE as a combined harvest and capture step into a downstream process. Additionally, a model is applied that allows early prediction of settler dimensions with high prediction accuracy. Finally, a reliable process development concept, which guides through the necessary steps, starting from the definition of the separation task to the final stages of integration and scale-up, is presented.",

            "text": "There is a current trend in biomanufacturing to move from batch to continuous processing (Bisschops & Brower, 2013;Godawat et al., 2015;Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015). This shift offers a number of potential advantages, such as greater efficiency, improved product quality, decreased production costs and a smaller equipment footprint. It also increases the flexibility for a manufacturer to produce both large and small volume biopharmaceuticals and to adjust production capacity to demands (Croughan et al., 2015;Zydney, 2015). Manufacturers can produce more easily stable proteins as well as labile enzymes and clotting factors that cannot tolerate the bulk harvest hold times often associated with batch manufacturing. Perfusion bioreactors equipped with cell retention devices have been used to create a continuous upstream process. Increased expression levels of recombinant proteins in a continuous upstream create a bottleneck between the upstream and downstream processes (Jungbauer, 2013). Capture columns, such as a Protein A column for monoclonal antibodies, can be increased in size or cycled multiple times during a batch to mitigate the bottleneck; however, for many reasons, these approaches are unsatisfactory (Bisschops & Brower, 2013). Continuous processing using multi-column chromatography can successfully integrate the upstream process with the downstream process and ultimately lead to steady-state manufacturing (Bisschops & Brower, 2013;Ichihara et al., 2018;Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015). A number of chromatographic systems have been developed for continuous product capture including the periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) and simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB) systems (Zydney, 2016;Bryntesson et al., 2011;Godawat et al., 2012). Chromatographic unit operations run in flow-through mode are often used as polishing steps in the purification of biologics and adapt well to a continuous process (Weaver et al., 2013;Ichihara et al., 2018). Operation in flow-through mode usually enables higher column loading and results in a more robust unit operation (Shukla et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly potent biopharmaceuticals that combine the targeting specificity of a monoclonal antibody with the potent cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. In the last decade, ADCs have made considerable progress: In 2021, ten ADCs were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and >80 are in clinical trials (Dean et al., 2021). For the coupling of the cytotoxic drug/payload to the monoclonal antibody (mAb), functional groups such as lysine residues or free thiols after reduction of interchain disulfide bonds are used (Tsuchikama and An, 2018). However, these conjugation techniques often cause heterogeneous drug-load profiles and a variety of positional isomers (Matsuda and Mendelsohn, 2021), (Kommineni et al., 2020). In the development of scalable and robust ADC processes, a major challenge is the characterization of critical process parameters (CPP) in each synthesis step that impact critical quality attributes (CQAs) (Matsuda and Mendelsohn, 2021). Especially, the drug-toantibody ratio (DAR), drug load profile and aggregate level are important CQAs as they directly influence the product safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (Stump and Steinmann, 2013). Different site-directed conjugation methods have been developed that aim to synthesize more homogenous ADC products, control the site of attachment, and achieve more stable conjugates (Panowski et al., 2014), (Jackson, 2016) . But even for these methods, productrelated impurities, such as under-and over-conjugated species or aggregation still occur (Hutchinson et al., 2018;Cao et al., 2019;Coumans et al., 2020). \n\nAt the same time, regulatory agencies increasingly promote the understanding of both product and process already in the development phase according to the concept of Quality by Design (QbD) (ICH, 2008). As the needed intermediates for ADCs are costly and difficult to handle, scale-down models (SDM) are often used in process development.",

            "text": "In recent years, with the development and application of proteomics technology, the development of large-scale culture of animal cells for antibody drug production has devolved from the simple optimization of some process parameters to the recent omics research, e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and fluxomics. The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2022). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs. \n\nThe high-efficiency expression and quality of recombinant antibodies can be affected by multiple factors, which can be achieved by genetic engineering, including the optimization of antibody gene sequence, construction of efficient expression vector, optimization of antibody expression system, modification of antibody host cells, and glycosylation site modification (Table 3). The application of these optimization strategies can effectively shorten the time of antibody generation and improve the expression of target antibodies. However, different optimization strategies have advantages and disadvantages, and how to effectively integrate these optimization strategies to make it an efficient operation system needs further study. Under different process conditions, the differences in the yield of recombinant antibodies by the production cell lines can be analyzed from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, laying a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes. In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies. Therefore, the focus shifts towards how to control the quality of recombinant antibody drugs scientifically and rationally, researchers should further combine the clinical evaluation and post-market safety monitoring, and continue to explore quality control.",

            "text": "During the manufacturing of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) these proteins are susceptible to a host of enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications. Potential modifications include glycosylation, N-terminal glutamine cyclization, aspartate isomerization, C-terminal lysine processing, deamidation, oxidation, glycation, peptide bond cleavage, and disulfide bond reduction and formation [1]. These modifications occur in the production bioreactor during protein expression [2] but modifications can also occur under conditions experienced during antibody purification [3], and storage under final formulation conditions [4,5]. Regulatory agencies recognize the heterogeneous nature of biological therapeutics and have issued guidance on characterizing and monitoring post-translational modifications. According to The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q6B 'The manufacturer should define the pattern of heterogeneity of the desired product and demonstrate consistency with that of the lots used in preclinical and clinical studies.' [6] One method to demonstrate product and process consistency is through monitoring the charge variant distribution through capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) as many of the modifications described above impact the isoelectric point of the protein variant. \n\nGlycation is a post-translational modification that has the potential to significantly alter the charge variant distribution, resulting in lot-to-lot inconsistencies, in part because it is difficult to control. Glycation is the non-enzymatic addition of a sugar molecule to a free amino group on a protein. The reaction can occur both in-vivo [7] and in-vitro [8] and the extent of glycation can be impacted by cell culture conditions, such as glucose levels [8] and the mean residence time of excreted protein in the cell culture media. \n\nPrevious studies have used enrichment techniques to separate the mAbs glycated during the cell culture process and used this material to identify glycation sites. Quan et al. [9] utilized this method of enrichment to identify eight reactive lysines that appeared to have a different susceptibility to glycation.",

            "text": "Cell-based (ex vivo) gene therapy offers a different set of problems such as high sensitivity to environmental factors and intrinsic biological variability. Unlike conventional therapeutics, ex vivo gene therapy products are composed of live cells from the starting material to the final product. As the cells cannot be filtered or sterilized at the end of culture before use in the patient, the entire manufacturing process must be carefully designed and enforced with excellent QC strategies in place to ensure the safety and efficacy of the final product (160-162). The existing manufacturing systems for gene therapy are largely manual involving planar culture systems, which are difficult to scale-up and are riddled with batch-to-batch variability due to human error (163, 164). Cell based gene therapies typically use . /fvets. . the patient's own cells as starting material which is also a source of variation owing to the inherent biological differences between donors. This variability can be considerably reduced when using allogenic or \"off-the-shelf \" therapies where cells from one individual can be used for multiple treatments. In contrast, autologous cell-based therapies, where cells taken from a patient are reintroduced into the same patient, present additional manufacturing challenges to control for the biological variation in the input material and inconsistent storage and preservation methods across samples (164-167). To add to these challenges, commercial gene therapy products are tightly regulated and are required to be produced in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). However, this becomes challenging in the field of patient-specific (autologous) therapies where the cells are often sourced from a diseased joint and therefore, may not meet the required GMP standard (163, 168). In this context, gene therapy manufacturing processes would benefit from a more adaptive strategy that accounts for the inherent biological variation in the input material, differences in product quality and the complexity of viral systems. Technological improvements in viral manufacturing in future years is also likely to help in overcoming obstacles in large scale vector manufacturing and facilitating easier clinical translation.",

Although much process characterization and validation work can be performed using qualified scale-down models, full-scale process validation is required to demonstrate consistent process performance and product quality when controlling critical process parameters within pre-defined acceptable ranges at commercial scale. For validation purposes, three and five consecutive full-scale runs are normally required for BLA approval in the US and EU, respectively. \n\nThe objectives of process characterization include identification of critical operational parameters and key performance indicators, establishment of acceptable ranges for operational parameters, and demonstration of process robustness. 2,79,80 echnical information from the characterization studies has also become a regulatory expectation in recent years as a prerequisite for manufacturing process validation, as well as for long-term commercial manufacturing support. 77,78 Since performing a characterization study at the manufacturing scale is not practically feasible due to the cost of operation and limited availability of large-scale bioreactors, scale-down models that represent the performance of manufacturing scale process are usually employed. \n\nIt is also important to use qualified analytical methods and raw materials throughout the characterization studies for consistency and accuracy. Cell culture process characterization requires support from the purification and analytical groups to test process impact and monitor product quality. Some cell culture materials from characterization studies can be used as feed stream for downstream process characterization, especially for robustness studies, e.g., linkage between upstream and downstream unit operation performance.",

            "text": "The production of ADCs presents multifaceted challenges in pharmaceutical manufacturing sine ADCs are heterogeneous mixture of compounds with varying number of drugs and multiple conjugation sites. Therefore, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is typically used to determine the impact of single variables as well as interactions of multiple variables in early development stages. Initial stages involve the optimization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for robustness in the ADC manufacturing environment, with a focus on physicochemical properties ensuring suitability for the process (Ducry, 2012). \n\nAS for the ADC process development, achieving the desired drugantibody-ratio (DAR) is paramount for efficacy and regulatory compliance. It is necessary to take consideration of potential challenges such as mAb aggregation and drug/linker adverse effects. The manufacturing environment demands adherence to Current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) standards, emphasizing aseptic conditions to protect operators and products. The challenges escalate when handling powdered cytotoxic reagents, requiring specialized containment measures and advanced personal protection equipment. Current manufacturing plants is designed for reducing microbial contamination such as endotoxin, but not able to eliminate highly potent cytotoxic compound with occupational exposure levels (OELs) in the nanogram range (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2007). Moreover, the purification process introduces additional complexities, including variations in DAR, unincorporated drug, spacer derivatives, and organic solvents. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and chromatography modalities are employed, necessitating optimization to account for potential stability and solubility issues. Throughout, operator and environmental protection remain paramount, leading to the adoption of closed systems and single-use components which cause production cost increasing. \n\nIn summary, ADC manufacturing presents complex challenges requiring innovations in mAb processing, conjugation chemistry, purification techniques, and facility design. Success in overcoming these challenges is essential for the development and production of safe, effective, and marketable ADC therapies.",

            "text": "The clinical use of recombinant monoclonal IgG antibodies (mAbs) is growing over recent years. MAbs are commonly produced in mammalian cells, especially in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and are secreted extracellularly into culture media. At the end of the culture process, cells are separated from the culture media during the primary recovery step using methods such as centrifugation, depth filtration, or flocculation to clarify the harvest fluid. During this process, the cells may suffer various stresses, including mechanical shear, exposure to a low dissolved oxygen (DO) environment, or temperature and pH shifts. These stresses may cause cell damage, resulting in the release of undesired intracellular components into the clarified fluid. These cytosolic components, such as lipids and enzymes, can potentially affect product quality, and must be carefully monitored or removed. ][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Multiple intracellular redox components have been implicated in the reduction of antibody disulfide bonds, such as the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR), 5,7,8 and the glutathione/glutathione reductase (Glu/GR) 8 systems. The thioredoxin system consists of Trx and TrxR and uses the cofactor nicotinamide, adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as an electron donor. The glutathione system is made up of glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutaredoxin and NADPH. The two systems share multiple similarities in components and mechanisms, and so either one of them or even a combination of them has been shown to be responsible for disulfide bond reduction during therapeutic antibody production in CHO cells. 8 Manufacturing processes can have a direct impact on the extent of reduction. The disulfide reduction has been observed at manufacturing-scale processes, but not typically observed in lab-scale bioreactors. 4,6",

For the sake of speed and simplifying sample preparation, this chromatographic approach measures nonlabeled underivatized amino acids using a mass spectrometer. This allows us to be able to quantitate amino acid concentrations in the bioreactor media in near real time and support customized control of individual nutrient species. After the bioreactor run was completed, we performed glycan characterization and measured additional product quality characteristics such as charge variants and size variants, permitting us to associate specific amino acids with their estimated effect on the final antibody quality profile. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of PAT tools in a manufacturing setting to aid bioprocessing and support the development of advanced feeding strategies to control product quality. \n\nOur research addressed the need to better understand how complex input variables within the biomanufacturing process affect product quality. [6][7] N-linked glycosylation may affect various therapeutic properties of the antibody, from effector function, immunogenicity, stability, and clearance rate. 8 IgG antibodies feature conserved N-glycosylation sites at Asn 297 in the constant region of the Fc heavy chain, which influence effector binding to downstream molecules such as Fc\u03b3 receptors that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a critical mechanism for many biotherapeutics. 9 Even for antibodies where the mechanism of action is not through ADCC, an abnormal glycan profile can affect efficacy through alteration of the immunogenicity, stability, or clearance rate. \n\nThe mechanisms by which glycoforms can affect antibody product performance have been experimentally characterized, such as how fucose sterically inhibits interaction with the Fc\u03b3 receptor and reduces ADCC-mediated activity. 10",

            "text": "The significance of quality control in LNP industrial production cannot be overstated as it is pivotal to ensure the safety, efficacy, and consistent therapeutic performance of these products. Manufacturers must adhere to stringent quality control procedures throughout the entire production process to guarantee that the final LNP product aligns with the required specifications and standards. An essential aspect of quality control involves a thorough validation of the manufacturing process itself, verifying its reproducibility, consistency, and adherence to the required quality benchmarks. To achieve this, manufacturers should implement a robust quality management system, incorporating regular audits, inspections, and comprehensive documentation to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. 218 haracterizing LNPs through quality control is crucial, involving the assessment of physicochemical properties like particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, morphology, and stability. 4 These attributes termed critical quality attributes (CQAs) for liposome drug products, significantly impact the safety and performance of LNPs, necessitating stringent control and monitoring during production. 219 Meeting regulatory requirements, LNPs should have a PDI value of \u22640.30. 220 However, the conventional batch process often yields large, heterogeneous particles (>100 nm), necessitating additional steps like extrusion, sonication, and homogenization to reduce particle sizes, leading to challenges in quality control and batch-to-batch consistency. Variations in lipid and component batches can further compound inconsistencies in the final product, aggravated by production condition differences, such as temperature, pressure, and mixing parameters. This approach's scalability to larger volumes poses challenges in quality control and increased variability. 221,222 lternatively, continuous processing, such as microfluidic mixing, offers better control over product quality and performance. 223,224 The incorporation of turbidity probes and UV\u2212vis spectrometers with predictive algorithms enables real-time monitoring and feedback, swiftly detecting and rectifying deviations from the desired specifications during production. The scalability achieved through pilot-scale mixing process scaling-out ensures enhanced reproducibility and facilitates scaled-up production. 225 n conclusion, achieving superior quality control in industrial LNP production requires a comprehensive approach involving robust process validation and meticulous characterization.",

            "text": "In 2013, 10 tons of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced to meet the therapeutic demand [1]. Particularly mAbs like adalimumab (Humira), of which extensive quantities are needed [2], can be produced more economically in large-scale bioreactors. These large-scale reactors can reach volumes of up to 25 000 L and with increasing volume, the mixing time of the reactor also increases [3]. This in turn can lead to the formation of gradients in pH, substrate, and dissolved gasses [4]. These differences between the reactor scales can negatively influence process performance and therefore product quality attributes such as N-linked glycosylation. Decreased cell counts were reported when scaling up a process from 3 to 25 000 L [5], while increased maximal lactate levels were observed during the scale up from 200 to 15 000 L [6] and when scaling up from 2 to 600 L [7]. Particularly changes in lactate metabolism have been implied to be a process predictor in the early stages of a cultivation [8], while lactate consumption was identified as the main factor to predict the final process outcome in an analysis of almost 250 cultivations [9]. This shows that changes in lactate metabolism can correlate to impaired process performance and therefore be an indicator that process scale-up was not optimal. Hypoxia [10], as well as a combination of bad mixing and CO 2 build up [11] have been identified as contributors to poor process performance at large scale. Particularly, increased CO 2 concentrations have been implicated to be correlated with increased lactate levels [12,13]. Since a higher pH is also associated with higher lactate levels [14,15], the intermittent exposure to an increased pH at the point where base is added from the top of a largescale reactor can also be potentially responsible for increased lactate levels. The characterization of occurring pH inhomogeneities of an 8000 L bioreactor for cell culture revealed that amplitudes of up to 0.4 pH units can occur, when the reactor is aerated, while approximately 5% of the cell population is exposed to the increased pH [16,17].",

            "text": "Batch-to-batch variations The vast majority of vendors do not manufacture all the antibodies on the catalogue, and most of their antibodies have been obtained from a wide variety of different manufacturers from all over the world under OEM agreement (Other External Manufacturer). Such an agreement usually has a clause to forbid the supplier from publishing which of their products are sold by their OEM vendor. The vendors keep up the appearance that they themselves are the primary source of all their antibodies. This enables them to keep QC data on the product sheet that were generated many years ago thus keeping the sales going, while the actual antibody that generated these data may have sold out and has been replaced by successive other batches (from different animals) and the current batch on sale may no longer be able to generate such data at all.\n\nEven monoclonal antibodies suffer from batch-to-batch variations, but not to such severe extent as some types (see above) of polyclonal antibodies. Nonetheless, certain hybridoma clone numbers are still being used for decades while, just like with cell lines, hybridomas cannot be the same after so many passages anymore. It is therefore misleading to use QC data that were generated decades ago, unless the current batch has proven to still be capable of generating such data (in which case one might as well show the latest version of the data).\n\nAssay developers are advised to buy antibodies straight from the manufacturer and ask for a free validation sample from a large batch in stock. Once validated for the required platform, the same batch then can be purchased in bulk so to prevent batch-to-batch variations during the entire project. Identifying the manufacturer can be a challenge though, and the only way to find them is to start looking for overlap between the product sheets from the different vendors. This way, a list can be generated at which point one can guess who the manufacturer was based on additional details still present on the manufacturer's product sheet but not elsewhere.\n\nQC data on the vendor's product sheet Vendors accrue data from their own customers or from their own QC department, thus making the OEM product look unique. This way the same antibody can show different QC data on different catalogues. And while batches run out and are being replaced by others, it can happen that a vendor has still some of the old batch in stock, while another vendor will",

            "text": "Background Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) is a promising host for production of recombinant proteins (including antibodies and antibody fragments) that don\u2019t require complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. During manufacturing-scale production of a one-armed antibody in E. coli (periplasmic production), variability in the degree of reduction of the antibody\u2019s disulfide bonds was observed. This resulted in variability in the free thiol content, a potential critical product quality attribute. This work was initiated to understand and prevent the variability in the total free thiol content during manufacturing. Results In this study, we found that the reduction in antibody\u2019s disulfide bonds was observed to occur during homogenization and the ensuing homogenate hold step where in the antibody is exposed to redox enzymes and small molecule reductants present in homogenate. Variability in the downstream processing time between the start of homogenization and end of the homogenate hold step resulted in variability in the degree of antibody disulfide bond reduction and free thiol content. The disulfide bond reduction in the homogenate is catalyzed by the enzyme disulfide bond isomerase C (DsbC) and is highly site-specific and occurred predominantly in the intra-chain disulfide bonds present in the Fc C H 2 region. Our results also imply that lack of glycans in E. coli produced antibodies may facilitate DsbC accessibility to the disulfide bond in the Fc C H 2 region, resulting in its reduction. Conclusions During E. coli antibody manufacturing processes, downstream processing steps such as homogenization and subsequent processing of the homogenate can impact degree of disulfide bond reduction in the antibody and consequently product quality attributes such as total free thiol content. Duration of the homogenate hold step should be minimized as much as possible to prevent disulfide bond reduction and free thiol formation. Other approaches such as reducing homogenate temperature, adding flocculants prior to homogenization, using enzyme inhibitors, or modulating redox environments in the homogenate should be considered to prevent antibody disulfide bond reduction during homogenization and homogenate processing steps in E. coli antibody manufacturing processes.",

Maintaining uniformity in nanoparticle size, shape, and surface characteristics during scale-up is a significant challenge because these elements have a significant impact on medication efficacy and safety. It is challenging to adapt laboratory-scale processes, like solvent evaporation and microfluidics, for industrial-scale manufacturing while maintaining product quality [134]. Precise control over manufacturing parameters is necessary Discover Oncology (2025) 16:422 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-025-02062-9 Review to provide uniformity in important quality qualities, like size distribution and drug loading efficiency, which is frequently difficult at bigger scales. The reproducibility of the finished product may be impacted by batch-to-batch variations in the quality of the raw materials, such as the purity of lipids and polymers [135]. \n\nSignificant obstacles are also presented by standardization and regulatory issues. Variability in quality assurance procedures results from a lack of globally recognized standards for characterizing nanoparticles, which delays market entry and regulatory approval. The entire cost of production is increased by the need for specialist handling due to stability difficulties under typical storage settings. Furthermore, the licensing process for these cutting-edge technologies is made more difficult by the changing regulatory environment for nanomedicine and the lack of standardization among international authorities. The creation of scalable production methods, standardized characterization procedures, and concerted efforts by researchers, industry stakeholders, and regulatory bodies are all necessary to address these issues [136].",

            "text": "From a biomanufacturer's point of view, incorrectly assembled chain pairings represent missed opportunities to generate the correct product, and are detrimental to the net yield and potentially patient safety. Fortunately, innovative technologies such as CrossMAb\u2122 (Roche) and 'Knob-into-Hole' have vastly improved the rate of correct chain pairings, though undesirable byproduct isoforms or incomplete pairings could theoretically still occur for some NMF structures [2,3,[17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. Moreover, NMFs have been reported to frequently have high levels of undesirable product quality (PQ) attributes such as aggregation, fragmentation, and clipping in a molecule-specific manner [14,20,[24][25][26][27][28][29][30]. The added structural intricacies of many NMFs, in contrast to mAbs, complicate the biomanufacturing of a consistent product and have potential to further decrement protein yields. In addition, fed-batch HID cultures could contribute their own challenges that may exacerbate the product quality hurdles observed with NMF production. With increases in protein concentration comes increased interactions between protein molecules, reducing the energy barrier for aggregation [29,31]. Likewise, a greater peak concentration of cells in an HID process leads to a potential increase in the concentration of proteases in culture at time of harvest, which in turn may lead to protein fragmentation [32]. Considering the expanding interest in complex biotherapeutic molecules alongside the growing adoption of intensified fed-batch processes for large scale manufacturing, the impact of process intensification on the product quality of NMFs in fed-batch HID cultures remains an important and unanswered question. In this study, the productivity and product quality of two NMF proteins, a CrossMAb \u2122 technology-formatted BsAb and a monoclonal antibody with an Fc-fusion protein, in both intensified and traditional fed-batch processes were compared. We demonstrate increased protein yields in the HID cultures for both NMF products, along with many comparable product quality metrics between intensified and non-intensified fed-batch processes.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies have been established as a major product class of biotechnology-based drugs. The increasing demand of monoclonal antibodies has led pharmaceutical companies to adopt efficient production processes. Transferring monoclonal antibody production to the industrial manufacturing requires adequate effort in process development. The strategy to reduce development time and cost comprises high-throughput process development which is especially central for the rapid optimization of the purification process. Chromatography process is the backbone of the purification process that can deliver high purity but it requires significant resources. Combined with high-throughput process development approach, the chromatography process is easy to develop and scale-up from laboratory to manufacturing scale. Design of experiments helps high-throughput process development workflow to provide decision-support techniques. This approach ensures significantly decreased time and material needs while improving the chromatography process. Protein A affinity chromatography is one of the most important chromatographic steps because of its great performance and capabilities. Most of the working parameters can be predefined and are identical for several monoclonal antibodies. However, some parameters like elution pH, loading capacity, resin type need further optimization for each monoclonal antibody. In this study, the loading and elution parameters were screened for Protein A chromatography to identify the best purification conditions using the combination of Design of Experiments and high-throughput process development approach in micro-volume columns. Developed working parameters were used for scale-up and tested under robust process conditions. Specific chromatography conditions were applied in pilot-scale and data comparison was done with micro-volume columns, lab-column scale to validate high-throughput strategy approach",

            "text": "Biopharmaceutical products are expected to be well characterized and consistent in quality to ensure patient safety and drug efficacy. The creation of stable and clonal manufacturing cell lines for biopharmaceuticals is a crucial step toward ensuring reproducible product quality. A substantial number of clones must be screened to find a commercially viable, high producing clone, typicially a time consuming, labor intensive process. Increasing pressure to bring drug products to market rapidly create the need for shortening timelines without compromising product quality. 1 he International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) as well as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) state that for recombinant prod-ucts, the cell substrate expressing the desired product sequence be cloned from a single cell progenitor. 2,3 The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently expanded on the ICH statement, \"the cloning procedure should be fully documented, with details of imaging techniques and/or appropriate statistics. For proteins derived from transfection with recombinant plasmid DNA technology, a single fully documented round of cloning is sufficient, provided that product homogeneity and consistent characteristics are demonstrated throughout the production process and within a defined cell age beyond the production process.\" 4 Limiting dilution and other low cell density plating methods that rely on statistical probabilities to claim monoclonality require multiple serial rounds of cloning to produce a clonal cell line. 5,6 Cell suspensions are not truly Poissondistributed due to dividing doublets or clusters of \"sticky\" cells which make a true single cell suspension difficult to achieve in practice. Vi-CELL V R Cell Viability Analyzer was used to estimate the percentage of single cells in ten inhouse CHO suspension lines during passaging. The percentage of single cells in these shaken cultures ranged from 70% to 93% (data not shown). Thus, although the clonality calculation for limiting dilution and other plating methods seem straightforward, they will overestimate the probability of monoclonality unless cell clusters are taken into consideration. In actuality, without a clear documented image of a single cell, a high probability of monoclonality is difficult to demonstrate. 7",

            "text": "A major challenge facing the biopharmaceutical industry centers on how best to improve research and development (R&D) productivity while reducing R&D and manufacturing costs. [1][2][3][4] Identification of strategies to reduce nonclinical R&D costs can yield significant improvements in R&D productivity given that they typically represent 20-30% of R&D costs. 5,6 Clinical manufacturing costs and process validation batches account for a significant proportion of the nonclinical R&D costs. Hence, biopharmaceutical engineers and scientists are keen to explore ways to develop more costeffective and agile manufacturing processes while continuing to meet product quality targets. Given the lengthy, complex, and highly regulated nature of the development pathway for biopharmaceutical drugs, the industry has been debating which biopharmaceutical production technologies will facilitate industrialization of the sector. [7][8][9][10] In recent years, continuous bioprocessing has seen a resurgence of interest related to its potential to challenge the established position of the batch platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). As a result, several companies have been evaluating continuous bioprocessing technologies [11][12][13][14] to determine if they can realize their potential benefits such as higher equipment utilization rates, smaller facility footprints, reduced cycle times, lower investment costs, and lower production costs. Recent FDA strategic plans 15 and Quality by Design (QbD) initiatives appear to encourage such explorations of continuous biomanufacture.\n\nA holistic assessment of continuous bioprocessing requires evaluation of the potential of integrated continuous bioprocesses across multiple products moving through the development pathway. This paper aims to achieve this by developing and applying a prototype decisional tool to address the following topical questions. Is there a business case for continuous bioprocessing for early phase manufacture? How does the business case change for commercial multiproduct manufacture? Will tomorrow's process be a hybrid of batch and continuous technologies? This study builds upon previous studies at UCL [16][17][18] that explored the batch versus continuous question initially for upstream processing and then for capture chromatography. This",

Regulatory oversight of biologic products is imperative to ensure adherence to good manufacturing practices and compliance with quality management systems. Current quality assurance protocols during production include monoclonality during cell line development, real-time monitoring of process parameters, flow cytometry for microbial monitoring, polymerase chain reaction, and immunoassay techniques to amplify DNA sequences related to bacterial or biological contaminants. FDA guidance recommends the implementation of process analytical technology within biomanufacturing production to measure critical quality parameters, which includes screening for potential biological contamination. Future advancements in bioprocess monitoring and control should capitalize on providing cheap, real-time, and sensitive detection. Biosensors, mass spectrometry, and polymerase chain reaction present robust, rapid, and real-time capabilities for multiplexed detection of contaminant analytes and have shown promise in meeting these needs. This review discusses the main biological contaminants of bioprocesses, European Union and FDA regulatory guidelines for monitoring and control within biologics production, existing methods and their limitations, and future advancements for biological contamination detection.",

            "text": "Ex vivo genetically-modified cellular immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies, have generated significant clinical and commercial outcomes due to their unparalleled response rates against relapsed and refractory blood cancers. However, the development and scalable manufacture of these novel therapies remains challenging and further process understanding and optimisation is required to improve product quality and yield. In this study, we employ a quality-by-design (QbD) approach to systematically investigate the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) during the expansion step on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of CAR-T cells. Utilising the design of experiments (DOE) methodology, we investigated the impact of multiple CPPs, such as number of activations, culture seeding density, seed train time, and IL-2 concentration, on CAR-T CQAs including, cell yield, viability, metabolism, immunophenotype, T cell differentiation, exhaustion and CAR expression. Initial studies undertaken in G-Rex\u00ae 24 multi-well plates demonstrated that the combination of a single activation step and a shorter, 3-day, seed train resulted in significant CAR-T yield and quality improvements, specifically a 3-fold increase in cell yield, a 30% reduction in exhaustion marker expression and more efficient metabolism when compared to a process involving 2 activation steps and a 7-day seed train. Similar findings were observed when the CPPs identified in the G-Rex\u00ae multi-well plates studies were translated to a larger-scale automated, controlled stirred-tank bioreactor (Ambr\u00ae 250 High Throughput) process. The single activation step and reduced seed train time resulted in a similar, significant improvement in CAR-T CQAs including cell yield, quality and metabolism in the Ambr\u00ae 250 High Throughput bioreactor, thereby validating the findings of the small-scale studies and resulting in significant process understanding and improvements. This study provides a methodology for the systematic investigation of CAR-T CPPs and the findings demonstrate the scope and impact of enhanced process understanding for improved CAR-T production.",

            "text": "By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11 With cost savings of roughly 35% for annual production demand between 100 and 500 kg, continuous processing achieves the highest cell densities (50-100\u00d710 6 cells/mL vs 15-25\u00d710 6 cells/mL for fed-batch) and volumetric productivity (0.5-2.0 g/L/day vs 0.2-0.5 g/L/day for fed-batch) as shown in Table 1. \n\nThe advantages of certain fermentation techniques in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are rather well supported by recent studies. A particularly successful technique for improving product yields in recombinant proteins manufacture has been Fed-batch fermentation. Mendes et al 12 revealed that fed-batch bioreactor production of recombinant BCG showed enhanced specific growth rates after day 4 in pH 7.4-controlled cultures, hence lowering the cultivation time relative to simple batch processing. Their research also showed that fed-batch samples showed substantial recovery of viable cell counts post-lyophilization, implying that extra nutrient supplementation during fermentation may protect cells during downstream processing. Continuous fermentation techniques have many interesting benefits for maximizing output. Continuous fermentation of penicillium brevicompactum achieved notably better productivity (0.025 g/L/h) of mycophenolic acid compared to fed-batch (0.007 g/L/h) and batch fermentation (0.006 g/L/h), Anand and Srivastava 13 found in their comparative investigation. With an ideal dilution rate of 0.015 h-1, their studies found that continuous culture essentially reduced substrate inhibitory effects and preserved the organism in a stronger adaptive condition. Though they remain vulnerable to contamination difficulties, Yi 14 pointed out that continuous fermentation systems run free through constant or occasional injection of fresh nutrient medium without any limits. These results imply that, with suitable application of continuous processing technologies, similar efficiency benefits could be obtained in monoclonal antibody production. \n\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.",

Following transduction and removal of excess vector and other residuals the cells are expanded in static cultures and then in bioreactors. 8,12 Cell expansion continues ex vivo until sufficient number of cells that meet the final product dose requirements have been achieved. To harvest the cells, the CAR-Ts are isolated from the beads, washed, and formulated in infusible media. The critical quality attributes of cells are evaluated to determine multiple parameters including: appearance, identity, safety, purity, potency, and quality of the final product.\n\nDuring the industrial manufacturing of CAR-Ts for global clinical trial applications, multiple steps were taken to improve process performance and robustness and to maintain the quality of the product. The key process changes included: enhancement of process control to ensure product consistency, introducing the automation process and closed systems to ensure reproducibility while preventing the risk of contamination. Further validation of analytical methods was also applied to improve the consistency of the final product. 13 T-cell based immunotherapy will require a consistent quality product in a suitable bioprocess format for manufacturing at scale. In order to ensure and maintain the quality of clinically relevant T-cell populations, a variety of quality control (QC) panel tests have been carried out by manufacturers to evaluate the expression levels of multiple T-cell surface antibodies including: CD4 + /CD8 + , CD45, and CCR7. 14,15 The presence or absence of these phenotypic markers will determine the diversity of T-cell subpopulations hence mandate the process condition including: feeding composition and rates to achieve targeted sub populations of T-cells that can be clinically relevant. For example, Naive T-cells are CD45RA + , CD45RO \u00c0 , CD62L + , and CCR-7 + . These markers change to CD45RA 0 , CCR-7 0 in CD8 + TEM cells. Thus, based on the expression level of these and other phenotypic markers T-cell subsets and subpopulations can be sorted, expanded, and analyzed for functional activities during immune responses against pathogenic agents or CAR-T cell therapies. 16,17 The ongoing, continuous process improvements will result in further enrichment in the",

This increased burden on the secretory machinery may also result in improper folded proteoforms, prone to aggregation and proteolytic degradation. As an example, the physicochemical and functional investigation of process fractions obtained during the development of an etanercept biosimilar revealed a correlation between reduced potency and incorrect disulfide bridging between specific cysteines in the receptor domain (Lamanna et al., 2017). \n\nDevelopment of appropriate cell culture media and feeds used in production processes of such difficult to express proteins is another crucial parameter to control the quality of the biotherapeutics and ensure maximum productivity. Similarly, process parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, cultivation time, and feeding regime can impact the critical quality attributes (cQAs) and thus need to be carefully considered. Comprehensive investigations were reported following the detection of clipped VEGFR1 Fc-fusion proteoforms. Multiple process parameters, cell culture media components, addition of protease inhibitor cocktail, and anticlumping agent were tested to identify the root cause explaining the proteolysis of fusion proteins. \n\nUltimately, lowering of the culture temperature from 37\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C was identified as the best lever considering quality, cost, and regulatory aspects (Chakrabarti et al., 2016). \n\nAnother extensive process development study was performed to obtain correctly folded erythropoietin (EPO) Fc-fusion protein (Ghorbani Aghdam et al., 2019). The final process included a twostep temperature shift, which led to an upregulation of genes encoding unfolded protein response specific transcriptional activators and ER-resident proteins associated with processing and folding in the secretory compartments (Torres et al., 2021). Finally, a study focusing on GLP1 Fc-fusion reported that media and feed formulations can impact specific posttranslational modifications such as serine phosphorylation or lysine hydroxylation (Hou et al., 2019).",

This is particularly the case for humanized monoclonal antibodies which are the largest and fastest growing class of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. This demand has fostered efforts to improve the efficiency of production as well as to address the quality of the final product. Chinese hamster ovary cells are the predominant hosts for stable transfection and high efficiency production on a large scale. Specific productivity of recombinant glycoproteins from these cells can be expected to be above 50 pg/cell/day giving rise to culture systems with titers of around 5 g/L if appropriate fed-batch systems are employed. Cell engineering can delay the onset of programmed cell death to ensure prolonged maintenance of productive viable cells. The clinical efficacy and quality of the final product can be improved by strategic metabolic engineering. The best example of this is the targeted production of afucosylated antibodies with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, an important function for use in cancer therapies. The development of culture media from non-animal sources continues and is important to ensure products of consistent quality and without the potential danger of contamination. Process efficiencies may also be improved by employing disposable bioreactors with the associated minimization of downtime. Finally, advances in downstream processing are needed to handle the increased supply of product from the bioreactor but maintaining the high purity demanded of these biopharmaceuticals.",

Pre-staging the process from the perfusion reactor harvest (N-1 perfusion bioreactor) did not show any variation in product quality of a mAb while targeting a specific product quality profile (Stepper et al. 2020). In a targeted feeding approach using a perfusion culture to influence glycosylation, target cell specific consumption rate, and cell specific perfusion rate (CSPR) in CHO cells resulted in different glycan profiles with different feeding regimes, even though a specific viable cell density (VCD) was used (Zhang et al. 2021). Bolus feeding during pre-induction period of the batch culture and harvesting earlier in the perfusion culture to increase specific N-linked glycosylation profiles has shown an inherent tradeoff between antibody titer and N-linked glycan profile (Mellahi et al. 2019). Thus, even for perfusion cell culture processes, under high cell density conditions, there is a potential risk to product quality and homogeneity. The previous studies characterized N-linked glycan profiles at a single VCD (either at the end of the culture or at a certain VCD) that did not provide information on how higher cell density during perfusion culture could impact protein N-glycosylation homogeneity and overall mAb molecular integrity. For these reasons, the effect of process intensification was investigated to produce a broadly neutralizing IgG1-\u03ba monoclonal antibody (VRC01) against HIV from a CHO-K1 cell line and variation in cell density was carried out in a perfusion cell culture to understand the effect of higher cell densities on product homogeneity.",

Therefore, acceleration of this timeline has a direct impact on the delivery of high quality, innovative medicines to patients. A balance must be struck between speed and quality to reach quick and efficient IND approval. For example, the goal of a fast development process with minimal cell screening must be balanced with requirements including high titre, favourable product quality attributes and the maintenance of regulatory compliance. Cell line development is traditionally a lengthy process and it is common to find development timelines exceeding 6 months. Limitations include cellular heterogeneity and the regulatory requirement for high probability and assurance of monoclonality which may require rounds of single cell cloning. In this study we explore approaches to mitigate clonal variation and develop a next generation expression system capable of maintaining quality in an accelerated time frame.",

            "text": "Biologics are produced from living organisms in complex, multi-stage manufacturing processes and contain inherent variability, which must be understood and controlled during manufacturing to avoid unexpected changes in key quality attributes that may contribute to clinically meaningful differences. The process must also meet large commercial demand, while simultaneously being able to accommodate change without sacrificing product consistency. The four key components of successful biologics manufacturing are (1) a stable, well-defined proprietary cell line; (2) a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant supply chain with a process control strategy defining acceptable levels of variability for target product/process attributes and capable of managing complex material flows; (3) a tightly controlled procedure for implementation of proposed process changes that ensures product consistency; and (4) built-in redundancy and flexibility providing the ability to adapt rapidly to unexpected developments. This report describes the requirements for the manufacturing and distribution of biologics, using Remicade\u00ae (infliximab, Janssen Biotech, Horsham, PA, USA) as an example of best practices. Since Remicade\u2019s first marketing approval in 1998, Janssen has manufactured\u2009>\u2009150 million vials used to treat\u2009>\u20092.6 million patients around the world for a variety of inflammatory diseases. Remicade displays a highly consistent quality attribute profile and meets all product/process specifications across multiple manufacturing sites and process scales. Janssen\u2019s experience with Remicade demonstrates that deep product knowledge, extensive manufacturing experience, diligent product/process monitoring and a sustained commitment to compliance and research are required to ensure quality, consistency and uninterrupted patient supply for large-volume biologics over the long term.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become the major biopharmaceutical products over the recent decade 1 . By taking advantage of their identical or similar post translational modifications to human, mammalian cells are considered as the main expression system for mAb production 2 . In this regard, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are the most commonly used host system for expression of recombinant mAb 3 . However, considering that CHO cell growth and protein production are highly influenced by the metabolic pathways, culture process parameters play a critical role in cell performance through the induction of certain metabolism pathways 4 . Therefore, understanding the linkage between cell metabolism and process parameters is of particular importance for process optimization and scale up 5 . pH, as one of the most critical process parameters in mammalian cell culture, has enough poten-tial to modify cellular growth and specific productivity rate 6 . Therefore, in almost all laboratory and large scale bioreactors, pH control system is automated to maintain pH at desired range by addition of acid or alkaline 7 . However, controlling pH with acid or alkaline addition is often a challenge for pilot and large scale bioreactors since increase of bioreactor size can exacerbate the effect of high local pH excursions by increasing mixing time 8 .\n\npH changes in the mammalian culture is mainly caused by lactate or carbon dioxide accumulation 9 . Lactate is produced as a final product of incomplete glucose fermentation and accumulates during the later stages of the fed-batch culture which results in pH reduction 10 . It has been shown that glucose and dissolved oxygen concentrations affect the lactate profile of mammalian cell culture process 11 . Additionally, low CO2 removal rates can cause significant changes in pH 12 . Agitation speed, sparge rate, bubble size, impeller position, and headspace aeration are considered as factors affecting pCO2 13 . However, improving CO2 removal through increasing agitation speed is almost avoided mainly due to detrimental consequences of agitation induced shear stress 14 . Moreover, due to the decreased surface area per volume in large scale bioreactors which result in a reduced aeration rate, sparging rate and bubble size are barely changed during scale up 15 .\n\nPrevious studies indicated that the factors contribute to lactate production and CO2 accumulation should be considered during process scale up 16 .

            "text": "Throughout recent years, the diversity of biologics has significantly increased as not only monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), but also nanobodies and multispecifics have become of major interest for future therapy approaches. Impacting the process design regarding purification strategies, these new developments also lead to a varying range of product demands from 50 to more than 500 kg/year [1,2]. In order to adjust to these new requirements, the implementation of single-use technologies might be a suitable option leading to reduced process cost and time. In contrast to the fixed size of stainless steel equipment, single-use containing surface by specific cleaning agents or solvents [6]. \n\nTherefore, appropriate testing must be performed and documented, proving that levels of leachables and extractables remain below certain values during the process. Relying completely on equipment obtained from vendors inevitably brings a high degree of dependency regarding the supply chain and quality consistency [4]. However, a reliable supply chain and a single-use purification process definitely embody the potential to reduce time to market [7]. \n\nContinuous processing is another promising solution for future products. Running a process in continuous mode eliminates holding steps and therefore leads to reduced process time and increased productivity. Godawat et al. [8] demonstrated the feasibility of an end-to-end continuous process for a mAb using a PCC-system while achieving an increase of 25% regarding resin capacity utilization and 20% buffer reduction at consistent product quality (Godawat et al. [8]). Further, it was shown recently that the simulated moving bed technology is another suitable option for the continuous capture step [9]. As the production plant is used more efficiently, reductions in capital expenditure and facility size are within reach 10,11]. Further, continuous processing is favored by authorities like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as steady state operations should in theory generate constant product quality [12]. Moreover, running end-to-end continuously in a closed process reduces the risk of bioburden [8]. It should be noted that a high level of process understanding and control are essential in order to assure consistent results.",

The rescue strategy can \"save\" the reduced mAb batches without sacrificing the manufacturing process flexibility or increasing the manufacturing cost. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the approach of developing the rescue strategy in manufacturing process has been reported. 8,16,[18][19][20][21] As a post-translational modification, a disulfide bond is formed by reoxidizing two neighboring free cysteine residues.- [22][23][24] Though there is a vast body of knowledge of in-vitro disulfide reoxidation for antibodies, the majority of these studies focused on the solution environment with limited investigational conditions. 8,18,19,25,26 The existing studies cannot be directly and practically implemented in manufacturing process for three reasons. First, the reaction parameters were not optimized under typical manufacturing operation conditions to achieve high intact purity and fast reoxidation kinetics. Second, there is limited information on whether any downstream unit operation (such as Protein A chromatography, ion exchange chromatograph, and ultrafiltration/diafiltration) can be selected to implement the rescue strategies. Also, the manufacturability of using the rescue strategies at a large scale remains to be seen. Third, there is a lack of comprehensive characterizations to confirm the product comparability between the rescued mAb and the reference material. Thus, to develop practical industrial rescue strategies, the gap between the existing disulfide bond formation studies and the general mAb manufacturing process must be bridged.\n\nIn this series of studies, we systematically evaluated how to implement the reduced mAb rescue strategy into the mAb manufacturing process to bridge the aforementioned gap. Our studies are discussed in two papers: 1) the \"proof-ofconcept\" study evaluated the possibilities of rescuing reduced mAb, selected the unit operation step (Protein A chromatography) to include the rescue strategy and developed the kinetics models to optimize reaction parameters under typical manufacturing operation conditions; and 2) the \"developability and manufacturability\" study implemented a potential rescue strategy during Protein A chromatography and performed comprehensive characterizations of the recovered mAb, showing the capabilities of generating high-",

However, this can also result in increased risk of failure with a small number of lots, potential for additional savings if excess plant capacity could be outsourced or sold, potential increased stress to supply chain. There is also a need to ensure that all products adhere to the platform to ensure standardization and minimize changeover costs. Using a similar approach (Monte Carlo simulation) to that described earlier by Dr. Hubbard, Dr. Guhan included filtration area (clarification, viral, UF/DF), product pool volumes and buffer volumes as typical bottlenecks in existing plants when processing cell culture feedstocks up to 10 g/L. Potential strategies to overcome these bottlenecks include investment in existing facilities to achieve multi-product manufacturing, investigation of good engineering approaches to increase plant utilization and increase throughput (e.g. continuous processing), investment in systems for efficient multi-product manufacturing (cleaning technology, faster change-overs, automation and platform alignment) and continued investment in process improvements and new technologies to maximize plant throughput. While scientifically challenging and exciting, implementation of new technologies is accompanied by significant risk and cost. Current mAb processes are quite robust and capable of delivering high productivities and introduction of new technologies requires a good understanding of costs and benefits. \n\nQuality by design directives have placed a greater emphasis on the creation of a manufacturing design space, which when filed and approved by the regulatory authorities, allows manufacturing flexibility within the design space without additional regulatory approval. Purification process design space can be defined using a statistical design-of-experiment (DOE)-based approach to establish input parameters ranges that assure process consistency and product quality. Experiments based on the analysis of separate unit operations have a disadvantage in that performance of a single unit operation may depend on the quality attributes of the preceding step. Lynn Conley (Biogen Idec) suggested that one way to address this challenge is to forward-link the output quality attributes from the previous unit operation experimental design as input parameters. However, this approach may have disadvantages due to the increased design complexity, number of variables and results interpretation.",

            "text": "The design of a manufacturing process for biopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or any other commercial product is based on various criteria, such as capital investment, operating costs, process reliability and safety, and environmental impact. 1 While research on the economics of biomanufacturing processes has become popular in the last 10 years, [2][3][4][5][6] there is little research and insight into the environmental impacts of adopting particular biomanufacturing processes and different biomanufacturing technologies. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) 7,8 is a systematic method that focuses on describing the environmental consequences of each element in a process but has not been used widely within the bioprocessing sector. The goal of this work is to propose an LCA-based framework to contribute toward designing more cost-efficient, robust and environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes for mAbs, which are arguably the highest selling class of biopharmaceuticals with a sales value of approximately $24.6 billion in 2012 in the United States. 9 urrently, the large-scale production of mAbs is based on production systems that use recombinant mammalian cells. 10 ed-batch (FB) bioreactors have become the default platform technology for large-scale production of mAb due to their ease of scalability (up to 20,000 L), robustness, and high volumetric productivity. 11 In contrast to a FB bioreactor, a perfusion bioreactor operates continuously by feeding and withdrawing the culture media while retaining cells within the bioreactor. 12,13 The operability of a new piece of equipment or a process needs to be weighed against the resulting economic advantages and environmental burdens. While there is literature emerging on the economic impact of different bioreactor types, 3,6 the environmental burdens remain rather unexplored. To gain a better understanding of the trade-offs between the economic and environmental impact of FB and perfusion-based manufacturing processes, we present here an LCA-based framework comprising an LCA modeling software (GaBi) and an industry standard bioprocess model (BioSolve).",

            "text": "Specific molecule design strategies, e.g. knobs-into-holes technology combined with CrossMab technology greatly enhances correct chain association (8,9). Additional progress was achieved by excluding position-specific effects by using targeted integration (TI) host(s), allowing for homogeneous gene expression via integrating predefined expression vectors in the TI landing pad (10,11). Regardless, the manufacturing yields of complex antibody formats are lower than monoclonal antibodies, making them 'difficult-to-express' (DTE). \n\nCHO cells serve as the preferred expression system for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins (12). During the development of stable recombinant CHO cell lines, high-producing clones are generated and tested extensively to identify lead clone(s) for commercial manufacturing use. Notably, clone performance early during the cell line development process and at small scales (shake flask, multiwells) is not necessarily predictive of industrial scale performance (13). Constant changes in CHO genome via rearrangements and DNA methylation patterns result in large diversity of genotypes spontaneously arising in CHO cell populations (14). This instability is a constant and unpredictable feature with no population being stable or uniform over an extended period of time (15,16). However, the success of CHO cells in biomanufacturing is at least partly based on this flexibility to adapt to any given environment quickly (17). Importantly, once cells have physiologically adapted to their new environment, i.e. the bioreactor set-up, their phenotype remains stable, as long as this environment is kept (17). The field is, therefore, relying on miniaturized microbioreactor (MBR) systems as downscale models to closely mimic the production process of current good manufacturing practice in large-scale bioreactors (18). The MBR systems have been shown to reproduce the performance of CHO clones under conventional bioreactor production conditions (with regulated pH, dissolved oxygen, CO 2 and nutrition levels) (19). \n\nThe increasing demand of high-value DTE molecules is illustrated by more than 100 bsAbs currently in clinical trials, which underlines the need for developing high-yield expression systems.",

            "text": "At present, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to treat several clinical conditions such as cancer, metabolic disorders and autoimmune diseases [1,2]. mAbs are the most important product class in the biopharmaceutical industry [3], being produced by recombinant protein technology. The clinical demands for new therapies and for products that meet safety and efficiency requirements have placed increasing pressure on the development and manufacturing processes [4]. Both processes must be highly productive and cost-effective. To meet this demand, analytical assays are critical, especially when dealing with such complex entities as mAbs. \n\nAn in-depth characterization of mAbs is of utmost importance not only before they can be used in clinical trials but also during product development stages. PTMs including oxidation, deamidation, glycosylation, glycation, proteolysis, and others, may significantly alter the efficacy and safety of the protein drug [5][6][7][8][9]. Thus, regulatory agencies require a full characterization of the structural, biological and chemical heterogeneity of any biological drug product [10]. mAbs characterization is analytical challenging as these products are inherently heterogeneous, due to the presence of PTMs, incomplete processing, susceptibility to degradation and disulphide shuffling [6,[11][12][13]. \n\nIdeally, the methodologies applied to monitor the final product quality should also be applied throughout the entire pipeline to provide qualitative and quantitative information. This will enable optimization of parameters/operations in different stages of the protein drug lifecycle, from clone selection and product development to quality control and drug disposition. To comply with these requests, the analytical methods employed must provide detailed information, and ideally should be fast and with little sample manipulation. \n\nAn array of methods and separation techniques are used to monitor intact antibody process consistency and identify product variants and impurities. These include capillary electrophoresis and chromatography methodologies as ion exchange, reversed-phase, size-exclusion or hydrophobic-interaction [13]. These methods are time-consuming, require several instrumental setups and specific sample preparation methodology.",

Six out of the top 10 pharmaceuticals sold in 2018 were mAbs and a staggering 18 antibodies were approved the following year by the US FDA. 1 The global mAb market has been valued at USD $143.5 billion and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% from 2020 to 2026. To meet the market demand, there has been an increased expenditure in research and development in the industry to accelerate the speed from discovery to clinic. In the last few years, process simplification and process intensification have emerged as key areas of focus when designing and implementing bioprocessing strategies for promoting a more efficient mAb production process. Thus, advancements in novel technologies that promote these areas will play a major role in supporting the continued growth of the mAb therapeutic market space. \n\nIn the past couple of decades, the deployment of platform technologies such as using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as the expression platform have emerged as a standard practice in the industry to streamline the manufacturing process for higher efficiencies and flexibility. In the last 5 years, over 80% of approved recombinant therapeutic mAbs were expressed in mammalian cell culture systems and predominately in CHO cell lines. 2,3 Further advancements in the understanding of cell biology and cell culture have led to higher cell densities (>25 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ml), increased cell productivity and longer cell culture durations which result in a higher titer and ultimately higher productivity. However, the increased cell mass and corresponding increase in soluble and insoluble contaminant loading have challenged the traditional approaches for separation and purification operations shifting the burden further downstream. \n\nTraditionally, the cell culture harvest unit operation is the first step for clarification and responsible for the removal of cells, cell debris, and other large insoluble aggregates. Legacy clarification strategies use a combination of centrifugation, depth filtration, and membrane filtration for clarifying cell culture fluid (CCCF). Together, these approaches are still widely regarded as the benchmark for clarification performance.",

            "text": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become a staple in the current pharmaceutical industry by providing clinical solutions for many highly abundant diseases and as alternative therapies to conventional small molecular drugs [1][2][3][4]. The large-scale production of mAbs is performed by using recombinant DNA techniques to produce high titers of the antibody in stable cell lines [5]. Inherent to this type of production is the heterogeneity that is found among the produced antibody products due to a combination of enzymatic and chemical post-translational modifications (PTMs) [6][7][8][9][10]. Product charge heterogeneity, resulting from these PTMs, is an important critical quality attribute (CQA) that requires careful characterization throughout the lifecycle of the antibody product to ensure safe and efficacious drug products [11][12][13][14][15]. \n\nIon exchange chromatography (IEX) is considered a gold standard technique for the characterization of protein charge variants [16][17][18]. Due to the isoelectric point (pI) of most approved therapeutic mAbs being over 7, cation exchange chromatography (CEX) is the most popular chromatographic technique to separate acidic and basic variants from the main mAb product [19][20][21][22]. The acidic species have lower apparent pIs and are produced via modifications such as the deamidation of asparagine, lysine glycations, and the sialic acid content, while basic species have higher apparent pIs and are formed via C-terminal lysine presence, methionine oxidations, or incomplete cyclization of N-terminal glutamate [13,21]. In order to separate and elute these variants from the CEX column, classical non-denaturing salt gradients and pH gradients are used with combinations of buffers (e.g., MES, HEPES) and salts (e.g., NaCl).",

            "text": "The importance of monoclonal antibodies in the biopharmaceutical industry is continuously growing, with past market data indicating an increasing trend for 2022 and overall mAb sales reaching 130-200 billion US$. [1] Current use cases and studies also underline the treatment possibilities of mAbs for novel diseases such as the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). [2][3][4] Rapid product and process development with a controlled production chain ensuring highest quality standards are necessary to enable fast approval and distribution of new therapeutic antibodies. Therefore, the FDA launched a guidance protocol introducing the Quality by Design (QbD) approach, a risk-based workflow to biopharmaceutical product development and manufacturing. [5] Said protocol was based on the Current Good Manufacturing Practice for the 21 st century initiative and consist of a framework for Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and multiple guidelines from the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH). [6][7][8][9][10] Until then, the development and manufacturing were limited by inflexible batch to batch quality controls as well as an unstructured relation between the process and the product application. The QbD approach aims to systematically improve a process toward product quality, regulatory compliance, cost reduction and fast track development. [11] In a split up approach individual process steps are investigated separately with specific intermediate quality outputs, before the gained results and process knowledge can be combined in a holistic way for the entire mAb production process. Therefore, the key objective of QbD with said method is to identify the intermediate critical quality attributes for the process, which can influence the products critical quality attributes (CQAs) as well as critical process parameters (CPPs) in order to establish a designated design space for the studied process. [12,13] The targeted roadmap for QbD implementation in the process development begins with a risk assessment, mostly using screening experiments and the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach. [14] Parameters considered as critical for the process stability or product quality are further investigated in a Design of Experiments (DoE).",

            "text": "Downstream processing is the bottleneck in the continuous manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To overcome throughput limitations, two different continuous processes with a novel convective diffusive protein A membrane adsorber (MA) were investigated: the rapid cycling parallel multi\u2010column chromatography (RC\u2010PMCC) process and the rapid cycling simulated moving bed (RC\u2010BioSMB) process. First, breakthrough curve experiments were performed to investigate the influence of the flow rate on the mAb dynamic binding capacity and to calculate the duration of the loading steps. In addition, customized control software was developed for an automated MA exchange in case of pressure increase due to membrane fouling to enable robust, uninterrupted, and continuous processing. Both processes were performed for 4 days with 0.61\u2009g\u2009L\u22121 mAb\u2010containing filtrate and process performance, product purity, productivity, and buffer consumption were compared. The mAb was recovered with a yield of approximately 90% and productivities of 1010\u2009g\u2009L\u22121\u2009d\u22121 (RC\u2010PMCC) and 574\u2009g\u2009L\u22121\u2009d\u22121 (RC\u2010BioSMB). At the same time, high removal of process\u2010related impurities was achieved with both processes, whereas the buffer consumption was lower for the RC\u2010BioSMB process. Finally, the attainable productivity for perfusion bioreactors of different sizes with suitable MA sizes was calculated to demonstrate the potential to operate both processes on a manufacturing scale with bioreactor volumes of up to 2000\u2009L.",

            "text": "Quality by Design principles are well described and widely used in biopharmaceutical industry. The characterization of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) production process is crucial for novel process development and control. Yet, the application throughout the entire upstream process was rarely demonstrated. Following previously published research, this study marks the second step toward a complete process characterization and is focused on the effect of critical process parameters on the antibody production efficiency and quality of the process. In order to conduct the complex Design of Experiments approach with optimal control and comparability, the ambr\u00ae15 micro bioreactor platform was used. Investigated parameters included the pH and dissolved oxygen set points, the initial viable cell density (iVCD) as well as the N\u20101 duration. Various quality attributes (e.g., growth rate, viability, mAb titer, and peak proportion) were monitored and analyzed using multivariate data analysis to evaluate the parameter effects. The pH set point and the initial VCD were identified as key process parameters with strong influence on the cell growth as well as the mAb production and its proportion to the total protein concentration. For optimization and improvement in robustness of these quality attributes the pH must be increased to 7.2, while the iVCD must be lowered to 0.2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. Based on the defined design space, additional experiments verified the results and confirmed the intact bioactivity of the antibody. Thereby, process control strategies could be tuned toward high cell maintenance and mAb production, which enable optimal downstream processing.",

Online search engines such as those listed in Table 1 offer advanced search and filtering options to identify commercial antibodies that may have user-submitted validation data, and scientists should be encouraged to share this type of data with the scientific community through appropriate portals.\n\nEvaluation by the user: trust, but verify-There is no guarantee that a given antibody will specifically detect and bind the target-of-interest, either in samples or in an experimental context (20), even if it has been raised against this target antigen. If the antibody has been validated for Western blotting either by the supplier/distributor or elsewhere, it should still also be confirmed by the user to be suitable for the intended experiment and assay context (18). Certain assay conditions, such as blocking reagents, can have a surprisingly large impact on antibody performance (Fig. 2). Each unique sample context is also relevant, given that samples from diverse sources and systems may contain different cross-reactive epitopes and produce different patterns of nonspecific binding.\n\nBatch variation-A significant source of irreproducibility is variation between batches of antibodies. Vendors and researchers producing antibodies are highly encouraged to perform validation testing on every batch produced. Using recombinant antibodies eliminates the need for continued animal or hybridoma usage and reduces batch variation, especially when compared with polyclonal antibodies. Recombinant antibody production is carried out via a synthetic DNA expression vector introduced into a suitable expression system (21) that removes traditional reliance on hybridoma cells. This technique reliably produces high titers of homogenous antibody while avoiding hybridoma instability and/or the \"genetic drift\" that can compromise performance. The sequence for an antibody-variable domain can be accessed from a validated monoclonal-producing hybridoma, or from synthetic libraries through phage display technologies (22). Recombinant monoclonal antibodies provide the largest benefit to both manufacturers and scientists",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibody (mAb) production in mammalian cells is a well-known technique for synthesising identical antibodies. These antibodies are proteins with significance in medical applications. In 2017, mAbs represented the 6 top-selling biopharmaceutical products and has an expected yearly sale of 130-200 billion US dollars in 2022 (Walsh, 2018;Grilo and Mantalaris, 2019). This has resulted in significant efforts to increase the synthesis of mAbs in bioreactors with mammalian cell cultures. Biopharmaceutical companies increasingly seek for novel protein production methods to accommodate for an increasing number of protein drug candidates that enter various phases of research. In today's competitive market, it is challenging to retain desirable quality attributes while shortening time to market, maintaining cost efficiency, and enabling manufacturing flexibility.\n\nHigh cell density and productivity at large scale are key factors to achieve high process yield. There exist multiple bioreactor designs to achieve a balance between cell growth and volumetric productivity (Blunt et al., 2018;Mitra and Murthy, 2022;Carvalho et al., 2017).\n\nStep-wise bolus injections of the feed solution to the production bioreactor is the most frequently applied method due to its simplicity (Maria, 2020). Recently, continuous bioreactor systems have received increasing attention due to its easy scaleup, waste minimization, and non-sterile cultivation (Blunt et al., 2018).\n\nMedium development for a bioreactor system consists of multiple parts including optimization of feeding strategies,\n\nCorresponding author: J.B.

Therefore, process models can lead to valuable insights and optimization of bioreactors without the need of performing expensive and time consuming experiments. As an example, mechanistic modeling and optimization has been applied for a U-loop reactor for single-cell protein production (Ritschel et al., 2019).\n\nMechanistic models are extensively implemented for bioreactor",

Minimizing media components such as glucose, reduces the production of lactate, but may also affect glycosylation. The first steps in the glycosylation pathway involve the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs). Glycan macroheterogeneity is introduced by variation in site-specific glycosylation with the transfer of the oligosaccharide to the protein. Further modification of the oligosaccharide can occur through processing reactions, where some sugars are removed and additional sugars added. This produces microheterogeneity of the glycan pool. Both macroheterogeneity and microheterogeneity may be affected by fermentation conditions. The objective of this study has been to investigate the effect of variable concentrations of glucose on the glycosylation patterns of a camelid monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and to further evaluate their effect on components of the N-glycosylation pathway.",

The consistency and predictability of a platform approach have significantly enabled the growth of this class of therapeutics. mAb therapeutics particularly lend themselves toward the application of platform approaches. Use of a well-developed mammalian cell culture expression system enables development of stable cell lines in a very rapid and templated fashion for mAbs. Several expression vectors have been optimized specifically for mAb production. 6,7 Robust fed-batch cell culture processes have been developed for mAbs. Several of these have been scaled to large-scale production and characterized extensively giving a good idea of the operating parameters that influence these processes. 8,9 Cell line development and upstream cell culture processes lend themselves to a templated approach very well. However, for most proteins the greatest area of divergence comes in the form of the downstream purification process that has to be customized for each protein based on its properties as well as that of key impurities. The Fc region of mAbs binds very specifically to immobilized Protein A which is a cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus. Protein A affinity chromatography has been shown to be widely applicable for mAbs and can achieve >95% purity with very little development on this mode of chromatography. 10 The chief challenge after Protein A chromatography is to remove residual host cell protein impurities, high molecular weight aggregate, DNA, and have the capability of removing adventitious viruses. 2][13] The ability to use a generic approach across molecules and starting from a template decrease the amount of experimentation needed compared with a protein that cannot enable the inclusion of an affinity step in the downstream process. \n\nThese downstream process platforms have successfully enabled the progression of a large number of mAb products into the clinic and commercial space.

            "text": "The landscape of mAb manufacturing is rapidly evolving with the integration of advanced technologies and novel approaches. Recent developments in machine learning, advanced analytics, and production platforms are revolutionizing traditional manufacturing processes, offering unprecedented opportunities for optimization and efficiency improvements. \n\nMachine learning applications have emerged as powerful tools in mAb manufacturing. 25,26 Machine learning approaches for protein expression optimization have shown particular promise as highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan and others. 27,28 Their research demonstrates that deep learning models can accurately predict protein expression levels directly from nucleotide sequences, enabling more efficient sequence optimization for improved yields. Process optimization through machine learning has enabled real-time adjustment of critical process parameters, whereas advanced monitoring systems utilize artificial intelligence to detect and respond to process deviations more rapidly than traditional methods. 29,30 rtificial neural networks (ANNs) have been effectively used in upstream processing to estimate the solubility of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli fed-batch cultivations and product titer. To estimate cell biomass and protein concentration with an accuracy of \u00b14% and \u00b112%, respectively, one prominent example used a radial basis function ANN with partial least squares regression and multiwavelength fluorescence data. 31 n ANN-mechanistic hybrid model was applied for root cause analysis of process deviations in ion exchange chromatography, thereby enabling real-time monitoring by ascertaining the reason and extent of deviations in milliseconds. 32 Using feed stream parameters to estimate suitable filter sizing, another application used ANNs to predict depth filter loading capacity for clarity of monoclonal antibodies in commercial manufacture. 33 merging artificial intelligence method reinforcement learning has shown promise in control optimization, such as in a liquid-liquid extraction process where it attained 32% higher recovery and 23% smaller operational deviations compared to conventional controls. 34 Three times faster than traditional trial-and-error approaches, reinforcement learning was also applied to maximize parameters in cation-exchange chromatography. 35 dvanced analytics have become increasingly crucial in modern mAb manufacturing, with PAT leading the way in real-time process monitoring and control. 36 This technology enables continuous assessment of critical quality attributes, allowing for immediate process adjustments to maintain optimal conditions. QbD principles have been integrated with advanced analytics to create robust manufacturing processes that ensure consistent product quality.",

            "text": "Biopharmaceuticals have become an integral part of modern medicine since the production of insulin using recombinant DNA technology in 1978 [1]. Since then various recombinant protein therapeutics have been industrially produced to treat conditions ranging from cancer to infertility. These approved products include monoclonal antibodies, hormones, clotting factors, enzymes, vaccines and nucleic acid-based products [2]. While a high product titer is desirable, product quality such as correct folding and posttranslational modifications that are compatible with humans, is of key importance. This leads to very specific requirements that the production host needs to fulfill. The production of biologically active forms of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using CHO cells in 1987 marked the beginning of the CHO-based therapeutics era [3]. Due to their adaptability, the robustness of CHO cells also enables growth and protein production in a variety of culture conditions. The continuous increase in demand for biopharmaceuticals has been noticed over the past, with estimated total sales of $140 billion in 2013 [4] and $188 billion in 2017 [2]. Today, over 70% of recombinant biopharmaceuticals are produced in CHO cell factories [5]. Monoclonal antibodies, 84% of which are produced in CHO expression systems, have been reported to dominate the biopharmaceutical market [2,5]. \n\nWhile these cell lines are considered the preferred cell factory for the production of biotherapeutics, the instability of transgene expression during scale up and manufacture presents significant challenges to the biopharmaceutical industry in the context of reliable yields and regulatory approval for the product of interest. \n\nConventional strategies based on 'random transgene integration' have been considered to be one of the causes for instability and potential product heterogeneity [6,7]. This is primarily due to the impact of the genomic profile on the integration site. Over the years, many studies investigated factors associated with transgene integration and subsequent perturbation in molecular mechanisms that in turn may disturb protein production.",

            "text": "Purpose: Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are currently the leading hosts for biosimilar Immunoglobulin G (IgG) production in the biopharmaceutical industry. Most eukaryotic proteins are glycosylated, and charge variants affect both the in vivo and in vitro properties of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Adjusting the N-glycosylation patterns and charge variants while achieving high antibody titer is a production challenge. In this study, the effects of feed type and strategy on cell growth, product titer, glycosylation and charge variation were investigated using different CHO clones producing different IgG mAbs. Methods: Cultivated CHO cells were supplemented with different feeding schemes, under fed-batch productions of 14 days. Screenings were conducted in spin-tubes and further investigated in 3L bioreactor systems. Results: Change in feed strategy decreased productivities by 10.4% (P < 0.05), while it increased non-fucosylated glycoforms by 33.3% and enhanced galactosylation up to 3-folds. Basic variants were observed to increase 2.5 folds. Conclusion: These remarkable alterations are of great importance in terms of mAb quality, in a manufacturing point of view, as they provide modulation of efficacy and safety. This reveals that feed strategy is a major driving force that significantly impacts culture longevity, galactosylated glycoforms, high-mannose glycan contents and charge variants.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become the most prevalent biopharmaceutical modality, used to treat indications from viral infections to cancer. Numerous other protein-based drugs continue to evolve including antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecifics, coagulation factors, and cytokines, among others. In addition, new modalities such as viral vector mediated gene therapies and vaccines, mRNA vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies have more recently emerged to fill previously unmet medical needs. Common to all modalities is the need for comprehensive structural characterization, identification of relevant critical quality attributes, and quality control of these features to maintain safety and efficacy. Lessons learned regarding analytical best practices for mAbs, perhaps the most widely characterized and understood from a structure-function perspective, can be ported to other modalities. \n\nComprehensive evaluation of the fundamental performance metrics and analytical capability of a technology are a pivotal first step prior to adapting, translating, or evolving measurement methods to new systems. Innovative analytical technologies are often performed to enable deep characterization, elucidate mechanisms of action, or better understand the intricacies of a manufacturing process. These emerging technologies, despite their potential for profound leaps in product or process understanding, may have limited historical precedence, thus presenting a barrier to rapid adoption. Interlaboratory studies may serve to lower these barriers by providing a means of harmonizing technical approaches, reporting community-wide performance metrics (i.e. precision), defining method best practices, and/or understanding the underpinning principles and sources of uncertainty in a measurement system. \n\nPublicly available biopharmaceutical product-representative test materials are a pre-requisite to interlaboratory evaluation of community wide performance metrics. The NIST monoclonal antibody (NISTmAb) was introduced as a tool for advancing analytical methods pertaining to monoclonal antibodies. The NISTmAb reference material (RM) 8,671 is a recombinant humanized IgG1\u03ba expressed in murine suspension cell culture that has undergone biopharmaceutical industry standard upstream and downstream purification to remove process related impurities. This RM is intended primarily for use in evaluating the performance of methods for determining physicochemical and biophysical attributes of monoclonal antibodies.",

Although several organisms can be considered for recombinant protein expression, mammalian cells are often preferred for proteins that require post-translational modifications. Numerous strategies have been developed to increase the yield of recombinant proteins obtained from expression in mammalian cells. 6,7 8][29][30][31] However, although the final protein encoded by an optimized DNA sequence has the same amino acid composition, the modifications that are introduced might alter proper protein folding, solubility and activity by modifying the dynamics of protein translation. 32,33 Indeed, low frequency codons located at certain positions can be important to slow down translation and avoid ribosome 'traffic jams' or to pause translation for correct folding of the nascent polypeptide and membrane targeting of cell surface proteins. 11,12,34,35 n additional level of complexity arises when expressing protein complexes composed of different polypeptides. In this situation, over-or under-expression of one or several polypeptides can lead to a decrease in production of the final protein complex and the accumulation of partially assembled complexes. Monoclonal antibodies, which are composed of four disulfide-linked polypeptides (two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains), represent a relevant example given their importance both as research tools and as a class of drugs. Production of several grams per liter can be routinely achieved using fed-batch fermentation of stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. 5,36 The correlation between the level of light chain expression and antibody titer, as well as the presence of free light chains in the culture supernatant, suggest that the heavy and light chains are not expressed or assembled in a stoichiometric manner. 37,38 The situation is even more complex for the expression of bispecific antibodies that often require the expression of three or four different polypeptides and the formation of heterodimers to incorporate two specificities within a single molecule.",

            "text": "More than 250 biologics are available on the market today [1], and they comprise seven of the world's top 10 selling drugs [2]. Their use is so widespread that consumers can give little thought to the processes required to manufacture them. Manufacturers, however, must be ever cognizant of these processes, as they are long and complex. Biologics are produced in living systems highly sensitive to their environment, which poses challenges for producing them consistently. The need for sufficient manufacturing capacity and global distribution capabilities adds additional complexity. Meeting these challenges over long periods requires a deep understanding of a biologic's physicochemical and functional attributes and how these attributes are affected by material and process changes. Extensive development, manufacturing, regulatory and distribution expertise is also required.\n\nOne of the oldest and most widely used biologics is the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitor, Remicade \u00ae (infliximab), developed and sold by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its partners. Remicade became commercially available in 1998 upon US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease [3]. Since then, it has been granted seven additional indications [3], including pediatric Crohn's disease, adult and pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, and has been used to treat over 2.6 million [4] patients in 100 + countries. On any given day, approximately 600,000 patients are receiving or are in between Remicade infusions.\n\nOne contributing factor to the success of Remicade has been Janssen's ability to ensure an uninterrupted, adequate supply. Janssen has produced over 150 million vials of Remicade since 1998 and is currently delivering approximately 14 million vials per year. During this time, Janssen's manufacturing operations have been both expanded and updated [5], while simultaneously continuing to produce drug which meets quality specifications and market demand.\n\nIn this summary, we review the challenges associated with manufacturing large-volume biologics and the measures needed to ensure high-quality, long-term consistency and adequate supply by presentation of the example",

Despite this success, there remain opportunities to drive down the manufacturing costs of antibody-based therapies through cost efficiency measures. To reduce production costs, novel process intensification methods based on state-of-the-art fed-batch and perfusion have been implemented during the last few years. Building on process intensification, we demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a novel, innovative hybrid process that combines the robustness of a fed-batch operation with the benefits of a complete media exchange enabled through a fluidized bed centrifuge (FBC). In an initial small-scale FBC-mimic screening, we investigated multiple process parameters, resulting in increased cell proliferation and an elongated viability profile. Consecutively, the most productive process scenario was transferred to the 5-L scale, further optimized and compared to a standard fed-batch process. Our data show that the novel hybrid process enables significantly higher peak cell densities (163%) and an impressive increase in mAb amount of approximately 254% while utilizing the same reactor size and process duration of the standard fed-batch operation. Furthermore, our data show comparable critical quality attributes (CQAs) between the processes and reveal scale-up possibilities and no need for extensive additional process monitoring. Therefore, this novel process intensification strategy yields strong potential for transfer into future industrial manufacturing processes.",

Additionally, increasing demands on product quality result in higher complexity of processes and analytics, thereby increasing the costs for product work-up. Concentration and composition of impurities are critical for efficient process development. These impurities can show significant variations, which primarily depend on culture conditions. They have a major impact on the work-up strategy and costs. The resulting \"bottleneck\" in downstream processing requires new optimization, technology and development approaches. These include the optimization and adaptation of existing unit operations respective to the new separation task, the assessment of alternative separation technologies and the search for new methods in process development.

            "text": "An antibody is a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects called antigens. Using the ability to bind various target molecules, many antibody drugs have been developed and put on the market (Lu et al., 2020). Antibodies consist of two polypeptide chains, a heavy (H) and a light (L) chain, each of which is composed of two regions, a constant region (C) and a variable region (V). The complementaritydetermining region (CDR) of the variable region is essential to the ability of the antibody to bind to its intended target. Most antibody drugs are humanized antibodies that are constructed by transplanting the CDR from mouse monoclonal antibodies into human antibodies, indicating that antibody drugs share almost the same physical and chemical properties. Therefore, it is possible to standardize the manufacturing process of antibody drugs. The general flow of antibody drug manufacturing platforms is composed of upstream and downstream processes. The upstream process is comprised of processes of producing a cell line and culturing the cell line in a bioreactor, and the downstream process is comprised of processes of purifying the produced antibody component from culture media, inactivating the virus, and filling it as a pharmaceutical substance (Gronemeyer et al., 2014). Most of the processes are batch-type and are controlled by good manufacturing practice (GMP) production processes at pharmaceutical manufacturing sites. Because the antibody manufacturing process is standardized, it results in the standardization of manufacturing equipment, peripheral auxiliary materials, and raw material systems. The standardization of antibody manufacture has made it easier for biopharmaceutical companies to outsource their manufacturing to biopharmaceutical CDMOs (Lakhdar et al., 2007). \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, the foundries of the semiconductor industry have established the position in which semiconductor manufacturing technology is equal to or better than the IDM by acquiring novel technology and accumulating proven track records of the manufacture of semiconductor devices. We believe that biopharmaceutical CDMOs can provide manufacturing technology of the same quality as pharmaceutical companies. To establish a similar position to the foundry in the semiconductor industry, it will be important for biopharmaceutical CDMOs to acquire and develop distinctive manufacturing technologies.",

With a well-defined design space, processes can be optimized without requiring additional approvals [12]. Thus, accurate and reliable process simulation models can enhance the development of robust vaccine manufacturing processes, ensuring product quality and stability, and reducing development time. \n\nModel-based approaches have been widely applied in diverse biomanufacturing domains to enhance the efficiency of production [13,14]. However, in the context of vaccine biomanufacturing, the adoption of these methods has not kept pace, despite the existence of novel platform technologies for upstream and downstream processes in the biopharmaceutical industry [15][16][17]. This disparity can be attributed, in part, to the ever-evolving landscape of vaccine types, ranging from whole organisms to purified macromolecules, combined antigens, recombinant vectors, synthetic peptides, DNA, or RNA [2]. Regulatory concerns regarding the impact of models on CPPs further contribute to this constraint [18]. However, the application of modeling tools in vaccine manufacturing is emerging as the biotechnology sector increasingly embraces the QbD principles. \n\nThe aim of this publication is to provide an overview of recent advances in model-based approaches for the purpose of improving process development in vaccine manufacturing, and to give an outlook on how an integrated model-based approach can influence vaccine manufacturing in the future.",

            "text": "The industrialized production of vaccines requires consistent and validated processes and control assays of each step to ensure that the final product matches the quality standards for human use. The main production steps and the relative quality control tests are summarized in Figure 6. One of the most important steps in an industrialized production process is represented by purification. In the case of plant-based systems, the whole plant or plant tissues/organs are harvested and processed in purification facilities under current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). In the upstream processing a clarified extract is generated and moved to downstream processing and eventually formulated to produce the material according to quality standards. The recovery of recombinant proteins from host cells/tissues can be carried out by physical or chemical cell lysis. Centrifugation, depth filtration, microfiltration, or tangential flow filtration (TFF) are used for clarifying the cell lysate. Microfiltration is preferred in large production due to the robustness and scalability. An endonuclease treatment with Benzonase may be employed to degrade residual nucleic acids. The ultrafiltration/diafiltration/ultracentrifugation step may be included in the process to concentrate and buffer exchange the product, removing endonuclease, and also makes it ready for the next steps [128,129]. During concentration and buffer exchange the host cell proteins are further reduced. Purification by anion exchange chromatography is additionally used to decrease the amount of DNA and proteins from the host or eventual plant toxins. As an example, the affinity column purification process for recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed from tobacco leaves can remove alkaloids [130]. Altogether, the entire purification procedures represent the bottleneck for vaccine production as being the most time consuming, laborious, and expensive step. Moreover, each vaccine candidate demands specific procedures. \n\nPlant-based systems are often described as cost-effective due to the low cost of upstream cultivation. Different groups tried to estimate manufacturing costs for plant-based processes for monoclonal antibodies or other biopharmaceuticals, and concluded that cultivation accounts for only a small part of the process costs, while the downstream processing, especially purification, represents the major weakness that limits the commercial utilization of plant-based biopharmaceuticals [30,131,132].",

            "text": "In the biopharmaceutical market, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are the most important class of proteins to date. Hence, many studies with industrial interest in the improvement of the manufacturing process have been published leading to the establishment of a platform process for mAb purification (Baumann & Hubbuch, 2017). \n\nA typical manufacturing process involves three major steps: cell culture, purification, and formulation. During large-scale manufacturing, each of these steps is performed subsequently, whereas all steps are evaluated individually during process development. Additionally, the up-and downstream manufacturing parts are usually located on one manufacturing site, while filling of the drug product is often done at different locations. Therefore, the product is often frozen to reduce the risk of product loss by microbial growth, foam prevention, and mechanical stress during transportation and hold times in process development (Authelin et al., 2020;Kolhe & Badkar, 2011). However, freeze-thaw (FT) process steps come with disadvantages that might lead to protein activity loss (Bhatnagar et al., 2007) such as cryo-concentration, protein-ice surface interaction (Chang et al., 1996), and cold denaturation (Privalov, 1990). \n\nThese FT stresses might lead to protein aggregation (Mahler et al., 2009) and even native aggregate particle formation, which was previously reported for mAb (Telikepalli et al., 2014). Because of the high importance to the drug industry, several studies on FT processes of mAb formulations have been performed (Hauptmann et al., 2019;Miller et al., 2013;Rayfield et al., 2017). Such freezing processes are often categorized by scale and mode of cooling. Actively cooled freezing processes involve a cooling fluid, which is in contact with the container wall, whereas containers frozen in larger freezers are referred to as passive freezing processes. Across all freezing processes, cryo-or freeze concentration occurs due to exclusion of the solutes from ice crystals. This phenomenon is also well described for different solidification processes in various areas such as alloys (Shevchenko et al., 2015). From a macroscopic view, the area of solidification at the freezing front, where crystals grow into solution, is described as a \"mushy zone.\"",

However, the biological and logistical complexity of manufacturing a living product, including challenges associated with their inherent variability and uncertainties of process parameters, currently make it difficult to achieve predictable cell-product quality. Using a degradable microscaffold-based T cell process as an example, we developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven experimental-computational platform to identify a set of critical process parameters (CPP) and critical quality attributes (CQA) from heterogeneous, high dimensional, time-dependent multi-omics data, measurable during early stages of manufacturing and predictive of end-of-manufacturing product quality. Sequential, Design-of-Experiment (DOE)-based studies, coupled with an agnostic machine-learning framework, were used to extract feature combinations from media assessment that were highly predictive of total live CD4+ and CD8+ na\u00efve and central memory (CD63L+CCR7+) T cells and their ratio in the end-product. This computational workflow could be broadly applied to any cell therapy and provide a roadmap for discovering CQAs and CPPs in cell manufacturing.",

However, a growing number of next-generation biotherapeutics, such as bi-specific antibodies and fusion proteins, are difficult to express using standard fed-batch processes. Decoupling cell growth and biotherapeutic production is becoming an increasingly desired strategy for the biomanufacturing industry, especially for difficult-to-express products. Cells are grown to a high cell density in the absence of recombinant protein production (the growth phase), then expression of the recombinant protein is induced and cell proliferation halted (the production phase), usually by combining an inducible gene expression system with a proliferation control strategy. Separating the growth and production phases allows cell resources to be more efficiently directed toward either growth or production, improving growth characteristics and enhancing the production of difficult to express proteins. However, current mammalian cell proliferation control methods rely on temperature shifts and chemical agents, which interact with many non-proliferation pathways, leading to variable impacts on product quality and culture viability. Synthetic biology offers an alternative approach by strategically targeting proliferation pathways to arrest cell growth but have largely remained unused in industrial bioproduction. Due to recent developments in microbial decoupling systems and advances in available mammalian cell engineering tools, we propose that the synthetic biology approach to decoupling growth and production needs revisiting.",

The approval of marketing authorizations for four autologous therapies in the EU to date shows that these challenges can be addressed. In this regard, it is important to define the acceptable variability of starting material, which may have a broad range of acceptability separate to the acceptable variability of the manufacturing process itself, which will usually have a more narrow range. It is the control and variability of the manufacturing process itself and the results of product characterization and release testing that facilitate a robust comparability strategy enabling the effects of changes to the Table 2.

An example of this is within the cell plasticity technology area, particularly the induced pluripotent cell space where GMP grade banks and alliances on characterization are emerging at this early stage [45].\n\nFinally, for both autologous and allogeneic therapies, as discussed with respect to clinical trials, relatively low-risk final stage or point of care manufacturing steps may be required. Under the current EU GMP framework, these manufacturing steps for an ATMP are required to be covered under a full manufacturing licence.

            "title": "Temperature Upshifts in Mammalian Cell Culture: A Suitable Strategy for Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibodies?",
            "text": "Within this study, we showed that temperature upshifts were beneficial to achieve the desired glycosylation profile of a therapeutic mAb of IgG1 subtype produced in a mammalian cell culture process. We demonstrated that in the studied system, starting at lower temperatures and shifting to higher temperatures led to an optimized glycosylation profile. The improvement in quality went hand in hand with a decrease in product titer and lower cell densities. Other reports in the scientific literature also highlight that lowering the temperature has a positive impact on product titers [9][10][11]30]. However, as McHugh et al. showed in their study, the effects vary between cell lines and products [10]. The impact of temperature on the glycosylation profile of recombinant glycoproteins has been discussed in other reports as well [10,11,28,29]. However, the findings are dependent on the cell lines, products, and process conditions. Further studies on how temperature affects the glycosylation of recombinant proteins would be required. \n\nDuring the planning of the experimental designs, we thoroughly discussed the screening ranges. The chosen ranges for temperature before the shift and after the shift resulted in factor combinations involving a temperature upshift. Initially, we planned to restrict the screening range in a way that only allows for temperature downshifts. However, we finally decided not to restrict the screening range for two reasons. First, allowing a wider range of process parameters increased the statistical power to identify potential effects. Second, not restricting the design space increased the process knowledge gained from the experiments. In our case, the process optimum for product quality would have been missed if temperature upshifts had been excluded pre-emptively from the design. \n\nWe could not assess the link between physiological rates and product quality, as it was not the initial purpose of the performed study. The purpose was to investigate the impact of process parameters on product quality. For that reason, the calculated rates are themselves a function of the process parameters and, therefore, cross-correlated with the studied quality attributes. In addition, timely resolved product data were not available. The product formation dynamics could not be assessed, as specific product rates could not be calculated.",

            "text": "Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, is a popular monoclonal antibody-based drug used widely to treat various cancers, including lung cancer, cervical, colorectal, and renal carcinomas 3 . Bevacizumab targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which functions as the source of nourishment to the cancer cells by allowing blood vessels growth via a process known as angiogenesis 4 . \n\nMonoclonal antibodies are generally purified from mammalian cell culture using a platform process comprising affinity, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange column chromatography with intermittent membrane ultrafiltration, and diafiltration steps 5 . However, the final purified product is often a cocktail of various product variants a nd process-related impurities that could reduce the drug's therapeutic efficacy and, worse, pose safety challenges 6 . Charge heterogeneity involves product variants with altered charge characteristics and may vary in their clinical impact, vis-\u00e0-vis the main product 7 . It is known that nearly the entire production process affects the charge heterogeneity of the final product 8 , and as a result, manufacturers spent considerable resources designing a process that can manufacture the product of defined charge heterogeneity 9 . \n\nThe issue is of particular concern for the development of biosimilars 10 as the regulatory expectation is that the biosimilar manufacturer will meet the charge variant profile of the innovator product 11,12 . However, it has been pointed out that not all acidic variants or basic variants are similar in how they impact product safety and efficacy 13 . Hence, there is a need to understand the impact of the individual charge variants and this can Bevacizumab charge variants were isolated with high purity using semi-preparative chromatography. In order to obtain enough samples for each of the charge variants to facilitate their in-depth characterization, CEX separation employing a pH gradient was performed on a semi-preparative scale chromatographic system (Fig. 1b). The purpose was to obtain the resolution of the variants like that was obtained at the analytical scale to obtain material in enough amounts. These objectives were met with the separation method, and fractions of fixed volume (1 ml) were collected throughout the elution window.",

            "text": "Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, is a popular monoclonal antibody-based drug used widely to treat various cancers, including lung cancer, cervical, colorectal, and renal carcinomas 3 . Bevacizumab targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which functions as the source of nourishment to the cancer cells by allowing blood vessels growth via a process known as angiogenesis 4 . \n\nMonoclonal antibodies are generally purified from mammalian cell culture using a platform process comprising affinity, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange column chromatography with intermittent membrane ultrafiltration, and diafiltration steps 5 . However, the final purified product is often a cocktail of various product variants a nd process-related impurities that could reduce the drug's therapeutic efficacy and, worse, pose safety challenges 6 . Charge heterogeneity involves product variants with altered charge characteristics and may vary in their clinical impact, vis-\u00e0-vis the main product 7 . It is known that nearly the entire production process affects the charge heterogeneity of the final product 8 , and as a result, manufacturers spent considerable resources designing a process that can manufacture the product of defined charge heterogeneity 9 . \n\nThe issue is of particular concern for the development of biosimilars 10 as the regulatory expectation is that the biosimilar manufacturer will meet the charge variant profile of the innovator product 11,12 . However, it has been pointed out that not all acidic variants or basic variants are similar in how they impact product safety and efficacy 13 . Hence, there is a need to understand the impact of the individual charge variants and this can Bevacizumab charge variants were isolated with high purity using semi-preparative chromatography. In order to obtain enough samples for each of the charge variants to facilitate their in-depth characterization, CEX separation employing a pH gradient was performed on a semi-preparative scale chromatographic system (Fig. 1b). The purpose was to obtain the resolution of the variants like that was obtained at the analytical scale to obtain material in enough amounts. These objectives were met with the separation method, and fractions of fixed volume (1 ml) were collected throughout the elution window.",

            "text": "he cost of goods is not the main driver for biopharmaceutical prices, whether innovator or biosimilars, especially in the US. Nevertheless, the rising prospects of biosimilars and encouragement from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of five small-molecule drugs manufactured with continuous elements between 2015-2017 have brought about a growing interest in continuous biomanufacturing 2 and the commercial launch of continuous unit operations. Apart from enabling the sustainable production of biosimilars, continuous biomanufacturing can also reduce the cost of innovator drugs and likely help address drug shortages. 6,11 ontinuous manufacturing can also reduce the process footprint 12,13 and allow for greater domestic manufacturing capabilities. 2,14 The ability to manufacture most routinely prescribed drugs domestically in combination with reduced regulation has promoted competition and reduced the production cost of biologics in India and China to about 10% of that in developed countries. 1 cknowledging innovations in the manufacturing of small molecule drugs, regulatory agencies have urged the adoption of continuous biomanufacturing. 15 Although fully continuous bioprocessing has yet to be implemented commercially, as of 2015 perfusion cell culture and other continuous operations had been incorporated into the production of at least 19 commercial biologic products. 16 Despite these advances, several shortcomings remain, including technological gaps in process integration, real-time monitoring, and control, all of which would present challenges not just in commercial manufacturing, but also in process development. The lack of a precedent also raises concerns about regulatory uncertainty. Furthermore, investing in continuous biomanufacturing facilities without prior success also presents a business challenge. \n\nHere we review recent efforts in continuous unit operations, integrated processes, and process analytical technologies (PATs) that facilitate the implementation of continuous biomanufacturing, particularly of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Apart from assessing the technical progress and remaining gaps related to continuous biomanufacturing, we discuss the associated business, regulatory and societal incentives and risks. Finally, we propose measures to address the major factors limiting the adoption of continuous biomanufacturing.",

A template process enables rapid process definition and has proven successful for the production of large quantities of mAb. 2 Current large-scale batch manufacturers, however, still face several challenges, including high operating costs and high capital investment costs for upstream and downstream processing, 3 the speed of both scale-up and transfer, 4 and a large equipment footprint with tank-to-tank liquid transfer. 2 Integrated and continuous manufacturing has been proposed as an advanced processing method to address these challenges. 5 he potential advantages of integrated processing over a conventional approach include shorter processing times and reduced operator interventions, which may increase operational efficiency. Moreover, the use of smaller equipment and facilities will offer greater flexibility for manufacturing volume. Implementation strategies for continuous processing composed of individual unit operations have been reviewed and discussed, [6][7][8] including direct chromatography column loading, 9 in-line dilution, 10 multi-column capture 11 and single pass tangential flow filtration. 12 Furthermore, many companies have conducted their own evaluations and feasibility studies for continuous processing. 13,14,15  the biopharmaceutical industry, chromatography is a widely used separation and purification technology due to its high resolution. The bioreactor harvest is followed by at least three unit operations, including primary capture, secondary purification, and final polishing. The majority of purification processes for mAbs involve capture with a Protein A-based chromatography media, which results in a high degree of purity and recovery in a single step. Continuous processing comprising high-density perfusion cell culture and a directly coupled continuous capture chromatography can be successfully implemented as a universal biomanufacturing platform obviating the bottleneck of bioprocess scaling. 13 he purification and polishing steps generally incorporate cation and anion exchange chromatography, although hydrophobic interaction chromatography, mixed mode chromatography or hydroxyapatite chromatography may be used. 16",

            "text": "Drug development begins with the discovery of molecules that have shown the biochemical potential to treat illnesses. Based on manufacturability and potential profitability, drug candidates are then selected for optimization and, eventually, for preclinical and clinical trials. To ensure that sufficient material is available for the different phases, manufacturing is concurrently scaled up during this stage in process development. Also throughout these stages, all the data regarding drug safety, efficacy and manufacture is reviewed for approval by the corresponding regulatory agencies. Approval requires that the drug product is produced consistently and that it is safe and efficacious for its indication. Despite decades of advances in drug product manufacturing, pharmaceutical process development and approval is still extremely lengthy, highly expensive and uncertain [67].\n\nIn order to reduce their losses, manufacturers have traditionally relied on the so-called quality by testing (QbT) approach for drug development and approval [68]. In QbT, product quality attributes (the ranges for drug substance properties that yield acceptable safety and efficacy) are linked with a specific manufacturing process and its corresponding set of inputs (raw materials and process parameters) during clinical phases of development. The process inputs that empirically show to yield acceptable product quality are defined and are often maintained unchanged after phase II clinical trials so that manufacturers avoid costs associated with additional testing for regulatory compliance [69]. During manufacturing, the process inputs are controlled to remain at their pre-defined set points, and at the end of each batch, the product is tested for compliance with the desired quality [68][69][70][71]. This black box approach does not require mechanistic knowledge that relates process inputs with product quality, and because of this, the QbT approach uncouples product end quality from the manufacturing process. The main drawbacks of QbT are [10,69,72]:\n\n\uf0b7 Development and approval of pharmaceutical processes under QbT has proven to be extremely time-consuming (between 7 and 10 years [73,74]) and very expensive (US$1.2 to 1.8 billion per approved drug when the risk of failure is included [67,75]). This could be attributed, in part, to limited understanding of the relationship between product quality characteristics, therapeutic mechanisms and the effect process inputs have on quality. \uf0b7 Process control is not established by mechanistic links between inputs and",

For larger scale LV production, the role of process shear needs to be investigated as large-scale production means using larger pumps or running pumps at higher flowrate and therefore, potentially higher shear rates. Furthermore, higher productivity requirements also mean increased flux requirements to shorten the time during TFF operation. This impacts LV production in several ways: the shorter time may be beneficial for LV stability while the increased flux may mean the need to run at higher crossflow rates [145] or higher transmembrane pressure [65]; both may result in exposure to high process shear [271,272]. Viral vectors in general are known to be fragile and therefore sensitive to shear. For example, Valkama et al. [145] mentioned that an increased recirculating flowrate, by-passing a column, resulted in the 20% loss of infective LVs. However, an early analysis of work in our lab found that some pseudotyped LVs have high recoveries even after exposure to very high process shear using ultra scale-down (USD) (unpublished data). This demonstrates that process shear may have different effects on different lentiviral vectors and that the design of bioprocess operations (e.g., TFF) should account for these in order to increase productivity and meet requirements at larger-scale manufacturing. We previously demonstrated the use of ultra scale-down devices to predict a larger scale TFF operation to produce monoclonal antibodies [273]. This larger-scale equipment is of similar type to that used in LV TFF processing [140,145]. Ultra scale-down approaches have also been used to evaluate other unit operations [272]. USD enables whole-bioprocess assessment because of the small amount of material required to perform the analysis.",

            "text": "The interface of biological and digital information in biomanufacturing creates two primary concerns in evaluating cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities, that recur throughout multiple processes in the end-to-end workflow (see Figure 1, Peccoud et al., 2017). The first concern is the nature of the biological manufacturing platform, as information contained in biological systems is subject to both evolution and context in ways that may not be well-understood or predictable. The variation that biological systems introduce in manufacturing presents risks for product consistency. The industry has developed extensive bioprocess control strategies and release testing to mitigate risks for established classes of biotherapeutics to ensure consistent product with minimal lot-to-lot variability. However, this biological variation presents challenges for innovating flexible scaling of existing large-batch processes. The issue of inherent biological variation is a critical challenge in the manufacture of emerging classes of gene and cellular therapies where typical small-batch manufacturing across a wider diversity of product types precludes the reliance on large historical data sets to allow identification of subtle process deviation. For these small-batch products, subtle genetic deviation during cellular expansion steps may be magnified in vivo due to differences between the host and the patient. \n\nThe second area of concern is the integrity of the data associated with the biopharmaceutical manufacturing process, including data related to supply chain and cyberphysical systems. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are complex organizations that rely on technology as part of daily operations to tightly monitor and control biopharmaceutical production processes. The notion of a digital thread, which refers to data that follows a product and informs decisions throughout its life cycle, can be applied to the biopharmaceutical industry (Wang, 2018). The digital thread of the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals includes data that support the development and scale up of the manufacturing process, clinical data, post-approval data, and the equipment used to manufacture the product. As the number of interconnected devices and systems that inform digital threads increases, cybersecurity vulnerability increases, because one vulnerable device can result in a threat that compromises a single point, or an entire process, system, or supply chain.",

More than half of the 140 r-proteins that have gained approval for human therapeutic use are manufactured in mammalian cells that make possible complex post-translational modifications, like glycosylation. In the industry, r-proteins are manufactured by stable gene expression (SGE) following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. Transient gene expression (TGE) in mammalian cells is an alternative method for the expression of r-proteins whose main advantages are rapidity and flexibility. TGE involves the expression of the protein of interest from plasmids, which are transfected into the cells with a non-viral DNA transfecting agent, usually polyethylenimine (PEI). DNA is transcribed from the plasmids without the latter having been integrated into the host genome. Despite the recent improvements in r-protein titers by TGE and the scale up of this method to the 100-L scale, TGE remains so far a tool for protein production for research purposes. Therefore, to determine if TGE can be used for manufacturing therapeutic r-protein following GMP standards, different features related to reproducibility and product quality from TGE of a recombinant anti-rhesus D immunoglobulin G in HEK-293E cells using linear PEI were characterized. To test the effects of the size distribution and chemical structure of PEI on TGE, different commercially available PEIs were characterized and their impact on transfection and r-protein expression were assessed. The results showed that both the molecular weight distribution and the chemical structure of the PEI had an effect on TGE. However, the small variations in size distribution and structure between the batches of PEI from the same supplier did not affect significantly the transfection and r-protein production by TGE. Then, the fate of PEI and plasmid DNA in cell culture over time and their removal from the final r-protein during purification were determined and measured. Most of the PEI and pDNA remained in the cell culture medium after transfection. However, both PEI and plasmid DNA, which are additional components in TGE compared to processes based on recombinant cell lines, could be reduced to a concentration below the limit of detection of the assays after Protein A affinity purification of the antibody. To test the reproducibility of a TGE process, 10 batches of transfected cells were run in 500-mL orbitally shaken bottles. The cell specific productivity of the antibody was 20.2 \u00b1 2.6 pg.cell-1.day-1 on average for the 10 batches. The purity and size consistency of the recombinant antibody produced in those 10 batches was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography. Then, the glycosylation profile of the antibody produced by TGE in HEK-293E cells was determined by mass spectrometry and was reproducible over the 10 batches. Moreover, it was similar to the glycosylation profile of the antibody produced by 3 stable HEK-293E cell lines. Finally, as a proof of concept, TGE was applied for the development of a vaccine against the respiratory syncytial virus. The fusion protein of the respiratory syncytial virus was produced by TGE and used as an antigen for the development of a recombinant vaccine. TGE enabled the rapid evaluation of the candidate vaccine in animal trials. Overall, the results of this study suggest that TGE is a reliable and reproducible method for manufacturing r-proteins of a consistent quality, provided that some particular features, such as reagents quality and process parameters, are well defined and controlled. Since TGE makes possible the rapid production of virtually any protein, even toxic, it could be used to provide GMP approved biopharmaceuticals for clinical trials in a short time, reducing development costs of biological therapeutic products.",

The main factors influencing the yield of a production process are the time to accumulate a desired amount of biomass, the process duration, and the specific productivity. By comparing maximum cell densities and specific growth rates of various expression systems, we have emphasized the limiting parameters of different cellular systems and comprehensively described scientific approaches and techniques to improve host cell lines. Besides the quantitative evaluation of current systems, the quality-determining properties of a host cell line, namely post-translational modifications, were analyzed and compared to naturally occurring polyclonal immunoglobulin fractions from human plasma.

Recent progress in analytical technologies such as various modes of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has helped to elucidate the structure of a lot of these variants and their biological properties. In this review the most important modifications (glycosylation, terminal modifications, amino acid side chain modifications, glycation, disulfide bond variants and aggregation) are reviewed and an attempt is made to give an overview on the biological properties, for which the reports are often contradictory. Even though there is a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of antibody modification and their consequences, the clinical proof of the effects observed in vitro and in vivo is still not fully rendered. For some modifications such as core\u2010fucosylation of the N\u2010glycan and aggregation the effects are clear and should be monitored, but with others such as C\u2010terminal lysine clipping the reports are contradictory. As a consequence it seems too early to tell if any modification can be safely ignored."

During process development, it is important to ensure a reproducible, distinct and preferably homogenous pattern of the product."

During mAb process development, aggregates (high molecular weight (HMW)) and fragments (low molecular weight (LMW)) must be minimized due to their increased immunogenic risk and reduced efficacy. These product variants also may present a risk to product stability during storage, resulting in shorter shelf life. In recent years, with the development of high-titer mammalian cell culture processes, interchain disulfide bond reduction has been observed more often after cell culture harvest, resulting in additional productrelated impurities. Intracellular components, such as thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, have been shown to be largely responsible for disulfide bond reduction. To ensure antibody product quality, manufacturing in-process controls are necessary to control LMW species formed from reduction of antibody disulfide bonds. As a result, several strategies across the industry have been proposed to control disulfide reduction in manufacturing, including maintaining harvest dissolved oxygen, chilling the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), and limiting the HCCF hold time. Despite implementing active mitigation strategies to prevent disulfide reduction, occasional disulfide reduction can occur during a manufacturing run, resulting in out-ofspecification batches and substantial increases in the cost of goods.",

Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers, and its mechanisms of action consist of inhibition of HER2 signaling and Fc-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The objective of this study is to investigate the potential effect of proteinase hinge cleavage on the efficacy of trastuzumab using both a breast cancer cell culture method and an in vivo mouse xenograft tumor model.MethodsTrastuzumab antibody was incubated with a panel of human matrix metalloproteinases, and proteolytic cleavage in the lower hinge region was detected using both western blotting and mass spectrometry. Single hinge cleaved trastuzumab (scIgG-T) was purified and evaluated for its ability to mediate ADCC and inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro as well as anti-tumor efficacy in the mouse xenograft tumor model. Infiltrated immune cells were detected in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry.ResultsscIgG-T retains HER2 antigen binding activity and inhibits HER2-mediated downstream signaling and cell proliferation in vitro when compared with the intact trastuzumab. However, scIgG-T lost Fc-mediated ADCC activity in vitro, and had significantly reduced anti-tumor efficacy in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Immunohistochemistry showed reduced immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues treated with scIgG-T when compared with those treated with the intact trastuzumab, which is consistent with the decreased ADCC mediated by scIgG-T in vitro.ConclusionTrastuzumab can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases within the lower hinge. scIgG-T exhibited a significantly reduced anti-tumor efficacy in vivo due to the weakened immune effector function such as ADCC. The results suggest that the lower hinge cleavage of trastuzumab can occur in the tumor microenvironment where matrix metalloproteinases often have high levels of expression and scIgG-T might compromise its anti-tumor efficacy in the clinic. However, further studies are needed to validate these hypotheses in the clinical setting.",

In view of its indirect involvement in the above mentioned physio/pathological processes, inhibition of TrxR is an important clinical goal. As a general rule, the affinities and mechanisms of binding of TrxR inhibitors to the target enzyme are known with scarce precision and conflicting results abound in the literature. A relevant analysis of published results as well as the experimental procedures is therefore needed, also in view of the critical interest of TrxR inhibitors. We review the inhibitors of TrxR and related flavoreductases and the classical treatment of reversible, competitive, non competitive and uncompetitive inhibition with respect to TrxR, and in some cases we are able to reconcile contradictory results generated by oversimplified data analysis.",

However, the impact of antibody reduction on the downstream purification process has not been studied. During the production of an IgG2 mAb, antibody reduction was observed in the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), resulting in high fragment levels. In addition, aggregate levels increased during the low pH treatment step in the purification process. A correlation between the level of free thiol in the HCCF (as a result of antibody reduction) and aggregation during the low pH step was established, wherein higher levels of free thiol in the starting sample resulted in increased levels of aggregates during low pH treatment. The elevated levels of free thiol were not reduced over the course of purification, resulting in carry\u2010over of high free thiol content into the formulated drug substance. When the drug substance with high free thiols was monitored for product degradation at room temperature and 2\u20138\u00b0C, faster rates of aggregation were observed compared to the drug substance generated from HCCF that was purified immediately after harvest. Further, when antibody reduction mitigations (e.g., chilling, aeration, and addition of cystine) were applied, HCCF could be held for an extended period of time while providing the same product quality/stability as material that had been purified immediately after harvest.

When this happens, the drug substance does not meet specifications. Many investigations have been conducted across the biopharmaceutical industry to identify the root causes, and multiple strategies have been proposed to mitigate the problem. The reduction is correlated with the release of cellular reducing components and depletion of dissolved oxygen before, during, and after harvest. Consequently, these factors can lead to disulfide reduction over long-duration storage at room temperature prior to Protein A chromatography. Several strategies have been developed to minimize antibody reduction, including chemical inhibition of reducing components, maintaining aeration before and after harvest, and chilling clarified harvest during holding. Here, we explore the use of hydrogen peroxide in clarified harvest bulk or cell culture fluid as a strategy to prevent disulfide reduction. A lab-scale study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in preventing antibody reduction using multiple IgG molecules. Studies were done to define the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide needed to avoid unnecessary oxidization of the antibody products. We show that adding a controlled amount of hydrogen peroxide does not change product quality attributes of the protein. Since hydrogen peroxide is soluble in aqueous solutions and decomposes into water and oxygen, there is no additional burden involved in removing it during the downstream purification steps. Due to its ease of use and minimal product impact, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide treatment is a powerful, simple tool to quench reducing potential by simply mixing it with harvested cell culture fluid.",

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the article series and to celebrate the 2018 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and in Physiology or Medicine, which were given for work that is highly relevant to antibody therapeutics research and development, we expanded the scope of the data presented to include an overview of all commercial clinical development of antibody therapeutics and approval success rates for this class of molecules. Our data indicate that: 1) antibody therapeutics are entering clinical study, and being approved, in record numbers; 2) the commercial pipeline is robust, with over 570 antibody therapeutics at various clinical phases, including 62 in late-stage clinical studies; and 3) Phase 1 to approval success rates are favorable, ranging from 17\u201325%, depending on the therapeutic area (cancer vs. non-cancer). In 2018, a record number (12) of antibodies (erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), galcanezumab (Emgality), burosumab (Crysvita), lanadelumab (Takhzyro), caplacizumab (Cablivi), mogamulizumab (Poteligeo), moxetumomab pasudodox (Lumoxiti), cemiplimab (Libtayo), ibalizumab (Trogarzo), tildrakizumab (Ilumetri, Ilumya), emapalumab (Gamifant)) that treat a wide variety of diseases were granted a first approval in either the European Union (EU) or United States (US). As of November 2018, 4 antibody therapeutics (sacituzumab govitecan, ravulizumab, risankizumab, romosozumab) were being considered for their first marketing approval in the EU or US, and an additional 3 antibody therapeutics developed by Chinese companies (tislelizumab, sintilimab, camrelizumab) were in regulatory review in China. In addition, our data show that 3 product candidates (leronlimab, brolucizumab, polatuzumab vedotin) may enter regulatory review by the end of 2018, and at least 12 (eptinezumab, teprotumumab, crizanlizumab, satralizumab, tanezumab, isatuximab, spartalizumab, MOR208, oportuzumab monatox, TSR-042, enfortumab vedotin, ublituximab) may enter regulatory review in 2019.

Non-classical disulfide bond structure was first identified in IgG4 and later in IgG2 antibodies. Although, cysteine residues should be in the disulfide bonded states, free sulfhydryls have been detected in all subclasses of IgG antibodies. In addition, disulfide bonds are susceptible to chemical modifications, which can further generate structural variants such as IgG antibodies with trisulfide bond or thioether linkages. Trisulfide bond formation has also been observed for IgG of all subclasses. Degradation of disulfide bond through \u03b2-elimination generates free sulfhydryls disulfide and dehydroalanine. Further reaction between free sulfhydryl and dehydroalanine leads to the formation of a non-reducible cross-linked species. Hydrolysis of the dehydroalanine residue contributes substantially to antibody hinge region fragmentation. The effect of these disulfide bond variations on antibody structure, stability and biological function are discussed in this review."

Intracellular components, such as thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, have been shown to be largely responsible for disulfide bond reduction. To ensure antibody product quality, manufacturing in-process controls are necessary to control LMW species formed from reduction of antibody disulfide bonds. As a result, several strategies across the industry have been proposed to control disulfide reduction in manufacturing, including maintaining harvest dissolved oxygen, chilling the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), and limiting the HCCF hold time. Despite implementing active mitigation strategies to prevent disulfide reduction, occasional disulfide reduction can occur during a manufacturing run, resulting in out-ofspecification batches and substantial increases in the cost of goods."

Structural changes in the mAb can lead to unwanted immunogenicity, reduced efficacy, and loss of material during production. The pharmaceutical sector requires new protein characterization tools that are fast, applicable in situ and to the manufacturing process. Raman has been highlighted as a technique to suit this application as it is information-rich, minimally invasive, insensitive to water background and requires little to no sample preparation. This study investigates the applicability of Raman to detect Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) and degradation seen in mAbs. IgG4 molecules have been incubated under a range of conditions known to result in degradation of the therapeutic including varied pH, temperature, agitation, photo, and chemical stresses. Aggregation was measured using size-exclusion chromatography, and PTM levels were calculated using peptide mapping. By combining principal component analysis (PCA) with Raman spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy structural analysis we were able to separate proteins based on PTMs and degradation. Furthermore, by identifying key bands that lead to the PCA separation we could correlate spectral peaks to specific PTMs. In particular, we have identified a peak which exhibits a shift in samples with higher levels of Trp oxidation. Through separation of IgG4 aggregates, by size, we have shown a linear correlation between peak wavenumbers of specific functional groups and the amount of aggregate present. We therefore demonstrate the capability for Raman spectroscopy to be used as an analytical tool to measure degradation and PTMs in-line with therapeutic production.",

The subsequent systematic analysis of multi\u2010omics data showed that pH set points differentially regulated various intracellular pathways including intracellular vesicular trafficking, cell cycle, and apoptosis, thereby resulting in differences in specific productivity, product titer, and quality profiles. In addition, a time\u2010dependent variation in mAb N\u2010glycosylation profiles, independent of pH, was identified to be mainly due to the accumulation of mAb proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum disrupting cellular homeostasis over culture time. Overall, this multi\u2010omics\u2010based study provides an in\u2010depth understanding of the intracellular processes in mAb\u2010producing CHO cell line under varied pH conditions, and could serve as a baseline for enabling the quality optimization and control of mAb production."

By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale.",

In this review, we have highlighted several key milestones that have contributed to the success of CHO cells from the beginning of their use for monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression until today. The main factors influencing the yield of a production process are the time to accumulate a desired amount of biomass, the process duration, and the specific productivity. By comparing maximum cell densities and specific growth rates of various expression systems, we have emphasized the limiting parameters of different cellular systems and comprehensively described scientific approaches and techniques to improve host cell lines. Besides the quantitative evaluation of current systems, the quality-determining properties of a host cell line, namely post-translational modifications, were analyzed and compared to naturally occurring polyclonal immunoglobulin fractions from human plasma. In summary, numerous different expression systems for mAbs are available and also under scientific investigation. However, CHO cells are the most frequently investigated cell lines and remain the workhorse for mAb production until today."

                            "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale."

                            "Antibodies are typical examples of biopharmaceuticals which are composed of numerous, almost infinite numbers of potential molecular entities called variants or isoforms, which constitute the microheterogeneity of these molecules. These variants are generated during biosynthesis by so\u2010called posttranslational modification, during purification or upon storage. The variants differ in biological properties such as pharmacodynamic properties, for example, Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, complement activation, and pharmacokinetic properties, for example, serum half\u2010life and safety. Recent progress in analytical technologies such as various modes of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has helped to elucidate the structure of a lot of these variants and their biological properties. In this review the most important modifications (glycosylation, terminal modifications, amino acid side chain modifications, glycation, disulfide bond variants and aggregation) are reviewed and an attempt is made to give an overview on the biological properties, for which the reports are often contradictory. Even though there is a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of antibody modification and their consequences, the clinical proof of the effects observed in vitro and in vivo is still not fully rendered. For some modifications such as core\u2010fucosylation of the N\u2010glycan and aggregation the effects are clear and should be monitored, but with others such as C\u2010terminal lysine clipping the reports are contradictory. As a consequence it seems too early to tell if any modification can be safely ignored."

                            "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale."

                            "Since the first use of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for recombinant protein expression, production processes have steadily improved through numerous advances. In this review, we have highlighted several key milestones that have contributed to the success of CHO cells from the beginning of their use for monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression until today. The main factors influencing the yield of a production process are the time to accumulate a desired amount of biomass, the process duration, and the specific productivity. By comparing maximum cell densities and specific growth rates of various expression systems, we have emphasized the limiting parameters of different cellular systems and comprehensively described scientific approaches and techniques to improve host cell lines. Besides the quantitative evaluation of current systems, the quality-determining properties of a host cell line, namely post-translational modifications, were analyzed and compared to naturally occurring polyclonal immunoglobulin fractions from human plasma. In summary, numerous different expression systems for mAbs are available and also under scientific investigation. However, CHO cells are the most frequently investigated cell lines and remain the workhorse for mAb production until today."

Monoclonal antibodies are very complex molecules and can be modified during up-and downstream process thus leading to heterogeneous final products (Rea et al., 2012). Product heterogeneity may lead to various changes in physiochemical, biological and immunogenic properties compared to the desired homogeneous antibody drug. In more detail, protein heterogeneity may lead to different protein binding, stability, immune responses and pharmacokinetics [12]. Therefore, control of product heterogeneity within predefined analytical specifications is of high importance for cGMP manufacturing."

These variants are generated during biosynthesis by so\u2010called posttranslational modification, during purification or upon storage. The variants differ in biological properties such as pharmacodynamic properties, for example, Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, complement activation, and pharmacokinetic properties, for example, serum half\u2010life and safety. Recent progress in analytical technologies such as various modes of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has helped to elucidate the structure of a lot of these variants and their biological properties. In this review the most important modifications (glycosylation, terminal modifications, amino acid side chain modifications, glycation, disulfide bond variants and aggregation) are reviewed and an attempt is made to give an overview on the biological properties, for which the reports are often contradictory. Even though there is a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of antibody modification and their consequences, the clinical proof of the effects observed in vitro and in vivo is still not fully rendered. For some modifications such as core\u2010fucosylation of the N\u2010glycan and aggregation the effects are clear and should be monitored, but with others such as C\u2010terminal lysine clipping the reports are contradictory. As a consequence it seems too early to tell if any modification can be safely ignored."

                            "Antibodies are typical examples of biopharmaceuticals which are composed of numerous, almost infinite numbers of potential molecular entities called variants or isoforms, which constitute the microheterogeneity of these molecules. These variants are generated during biosynthesis by so\u2010called posttranslational modification, during purification or upon storage. The variants differ in biological properties such as pharmacodynamic properties, for example, Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, complement activation, and pharmacokinetic properties, for example, serum half\u2010life and safety. Recent progress in analytical technologies such as various modes of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has helped to elucidate the structure of a lot of these variants and their biological properties. In this review the most important modifications (glycosylation, terminal modifications, amino acid side chain modifications, glycation, disulfide bond variants and aggregation) are reviewed and an attempt is made to give an overview on the biological properties, for which the reports are often contradictory. Even though there is a deep understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of antibody modification and their consequences, the clinical proof of the effects observed in vitro and in vivo is still not fully rendered. For some modifications such as core\u2010fucosylation of the N\u2010glycan and aggregation the effects are clear and should be monitored, but with others such as C\u2010terminal lysine clipping the reports are contradictory. As a consequence it seems too early to tell if any modification can be safely ignored."

                            "Since the first use of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for recombinant protein expression, production processes have steadily improved through numerous advances. In this review, we have highlighted several key milestones that have contributed to the success of CHO cells from the beginning of their use for monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression until today. The main factors influencing the yield of a production process are the time to accumulate a desired amount of biomass, the process duration, and the specific productivity. By comparing maximum cell densities and specific growth rates of various expression systems, we have emphasized the limiting parameters of different cellular systems and comprehensively described scientific approaches and techniques to improve host cell lines. Besides the quantitative evaluation of current systems, the quality-determining properties of a host cell line, namely post-translational modifications, were analyzed and compared to naturally occurring polyclonal immunoglobulin fractions from human plasma. In summary, numerous different expression systems for mAbs are available and also under scientific investigation. However, CHO cells are the most frequently investigated cell lines and remain the workhorse for mAb production until today."

                            "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale."

                            "Recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the dominant biotherapeutics currently on the market due to their high specificity and long half-life. During mAb process development, aggregates (high molecular weight (HMW)) and fragments (low molecular weight (LMW)) must be minimized due to their increased immunogenic risk and reduced efficacy. These product variants also may present a risk to product stability during storage, resulting in shorter shelf life. In recent years, with the development of high-titer mammalian cell culture processes, interchain disulfide bond reduction has been observed more often after cell culture harvest, resulting in additional productrelated impurities. Intracellular components, such as thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, have been shown to be largely responsible for disulfide bond reduction. To ensure antibody product quality, manufacturing in-process controls are necessary to control LMW species formed from reduction of antibody disulfide bonds. As a result, several strategies across the industry have been proposed to control disulfide reduction in manufacturing, including maintaining harvest dissolved oxygen, chilling the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), and limiting the HCCF hold time. Despite implementing active mitigation strategies to prevent disulfide reduction, occasional disulfide reduction can occur during a manufacturing run, resulting in out-ofspecification batches and substantial increases in the cost of goods."

                            "Thioredoxin plays a crucial role in a wide number of physiological processes, which span from reduction of nucleotides to deoxyriboucleotides to the detoxification from xenobiotics, oxidants and radicals. The redox function of Thioredoxin is critically dependent on the enzyme Thioredoxin NADPH Reductase (TrxR). In view of its indirect involvement in the above mentioned physio/pathological processes, inhibition of TrxR is an important clinical goal. As a general rule, the affinities and mechanisms of binding of TrxR inhibitors to the target enzyme are known with scarce precision and conflicting results abound in the literature. A relevant analysis of published results as well as the experimental procedures is therefore needed, also in view of the critical interest of TrxR inhibitors. We review the inhibitors of TrxR and related flavoreductases and the classical treatment of reversible, competitive, non competitive and uncompetitive inhibition with respect to TrxR, and in some cases we are able to reconcile contradictory results generated by oversimplified data analysis."

                            "ABSTRACT During large-scale monoclonal antibody manufacturing, disulfide bond reduction of antibodies, which results in generation of low molecule weight species, is occasionally observed. When this happens, the drug substance does not meet specifications. Many investigations have been conducted across the biopharmaceutical industry to identify the root causes, and multiple strategies have been proposed to mitigate the problem. The reduction is correlated with the release of cellular reducing components and depletion of dissolved oxygen before, during, and after harvest. Consequently, these factors can lead to disulfide reduction over long-duration storage at room temperature prior to Protein A chromatography. Several strategies have been developed to minimize antibody reduction, including chemical inhibition of reducing components, maintaining aeration before and after harvest, and chilling clarified harvest during holding. Here, we explore the use of hydrogen peroxide in clarified harvest bulk or cell culture fluid as a strategy to prevent disulfide reduction. A lab-scale study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in preventing antibody reduction using multiple IgG molecules. Studies were done to define the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide needed to avoid unnecessary oxidization of the antibody products. We show that adding a controlled amount of hydrogen peroxide does not change product quality attributes of the protein. Since hydrogen peroxide is soluble in aqueous solutions and decomposes into water and oxygen, there is no additional burden involved in removing it during the downstream purification steps. Due to its ease of use and minimal product impact, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide treatment is a powerful, simple tool to quench reducing potential by simply mixing it with harvested cell culture fluid."

Small process differences can significantly affect the nature of the finished biologic and, most importantly, the way it functions in the body. To ensure that a manufacturing process remains the same over time, biologics manufacturers must tightly control the source and nature of starting materials, and consistently employ hundreds of process controls that assure predictable manufacturing outcomes [22]."

                            "In contrast to small molecule drugs, which have defined chemical structures and are produced by predictable chemical synthesis, biologics are large molecules produced in living systems (e.g., bacteria, mammalian cells) grown in complex cell culture media. By their very nature, biologics are subject to structural variability, which may alter their properties (e.g., binding, solubility, potency and immunogenicity), and consequently their safety and efficacy in clinical practice. In general, the larger the molecule, the greater the potential variability. Monoclonal antibodies such as Remicade are among the largest, most complex biologics, containing 1300 + amino acids arranged in various subunits, with molecular weights of approximately 150,000 daltons. These antibodies undergo many post-translational modifications and consist of various isoforms containing heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The degree of potential variability with monoclonal antibodies is considerable.\n\nMoreover, the living systems producing biologics are sensitive to the environment. Even subtle variations in the manufacturing process, such as changes in the cell culture media, pH or temperature, can lead to additional variability in the product. Raw materials used in production, such as in drug product excipients (e.g., sucrose or polysorbate 80) and in cell culture media (e.g., trace metals), are themselves additional potential sources of variability. The manufacturer must identify, understand and measure these sources of variability and then develop a manufacturing process that can produce drug with variability kept within acceptable levels. It is essential that this process, once developed, remains stable. However, over time, it will likely be expanded or updated, which presents an additional challenge. Given the sensitivity of the biologic to its environment, the manufacturer must ensure that process changes do not alter any of its key attributes. The central challenge, therefore, to producing biologics is to do so consistently over long periods of time at an industrial scale."

For instance, pH substantially affects N\u2010glycosylation, protein aggregation, and charge variant profiles, as well as mAb productivity. However, relatively less is known about how pH jointly influences product quality and titer. In this study, we investigated the effect of pH on culture performance, product titer, and quality profiles by applying longitudinal multi\u2010omics profiling, including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and glycomics, at three different culture pH set points. The subsequent systematic analysis of multi\u2010omics data showed that pH set points differentially regulated various intracellular pathways including intracellular vesicular trafficking, cell cycle, and apoptosis, thereby resulting in differences in specific productivity, product titer, and quality profiles. In addition, a time\u2010dependent variation in mAb N\u2010glycosylation profiles, independent of pH, was identified to be mainly due to the accumulation of mAb proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum disrupting cellular homeostasis over culture time. Overall, this multi\u2010omics\u2010based study provides an in\u2010depth understanding of the intracellular processes in mAb\u2010producing CHO cell line under varied pH conditions, and could serve as a baseline for enabling the quality optimization and control of mAb production."

Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product. \n\nFrom the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control. \n\nWith respect to batch-to-batch reproducibility, production processes for recombinant proteins are lagging far behind most other industrial processes. Figure 1 shows a typical example of the repeatability of biomass concentration profiles in a recombinant protein production process. The variability is quite high."

During mAb process development, aggregates (high molecular weight (HMW)) and fragments (low molecular weight (LMW)) must be minimized due to their increased immunogenic risk and reduced efficacy. These product variants also may present a risk to product stability during storage, resulting in shorter shelf life. In recent years, with the development of high-titer mammalian cell culture processes, interchain disulfide bond reduction has been observed more often after cell culture harvest, resulting in additional productrelated impurities. Intracellular components, such as thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, have been shown to be largely responsible for disulfide bond reduction. To ensure antibody product quality, manufacturing in-process controls are necessary to control LMW species formed from reduction of antibody disulfide bonds. As a result, several strategies across the industry have been proposed to control disulfide reduction in manufacturing, including maintaining harvest dissolved oxygen, chilling the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), and limiting the HCCF hold time. Despite implementing active mitigation strategies to prevent disulfide reduction, occasional disulfide reduction can occur during a manufacturing run, resulting in out-ofspecification batches and substantial increases in the cost of goods."

                            "ABSTRACT During large-scale monoclonal antibody manufacturing, disulfide bond reduction of antibodies, which results in generation of low molecule weight species, is occasionally observed. When this happens, the drug substance does not meet specifications. Many investigations have been conducted across the biopharmaceutical industry to identify the root causes, and multiple strategies have been proposed to mitigate the problem. The reduction is correlated with the release of cellular reducing components and depletion of dissolved oxygen before, during, and after harvest. Consequently, these factors can lead to disulfide reduction over long-duration storage at room temperature prior to Protein A chromatography. Several strategies have been developed to minimize antibody reduction, including chemical inhibition of reducing components, maintaining aeration before and after harvest, and chilling clarified harvest during holding. Here, we explore the use of hydrogen peroxide in clarified harvest bulk or cell culture fluid as a strategy to prevent disulfide reduction. A lab-scale study was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in preventing antibody reduction using multiple IgG molecules. Studies were done to define the optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide needed to avoid unnecessary oxidization of the antibody products. We show that adding a controlled amount of hydrogen peroxide does not change product quality attributes of the protein. Since hydrogen peroxide is soluble in aqueous solutions and decomposes into water and oxygen, there is no additional burden involved in removing it during the downstream purification steps. Due to its ease of use and minimal product impact, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide treatment is a powerful, simple tool to quench reducing potential by simply mixing it with harvested cell culture fluid."

                            "Thioredoxin plays a crucial role in a wide number of physiological processes, which span from reduction of nucleotides to deoxyriboucleotides to the detoxification from xenobiotics, oxidants and radicals. The redox function of Thioredoxin is critically dependent on the enzyme Thioredoxin NADPH Reductase (TrxR). In view of its indirect involvement in the above mentioned physio/pathological processes, inhibition of TrxR is an important clinical goal. As a general rule, the affinities and mechanisms of binding of TrxR inhibitors to the target enzyme are known with scarce precision and conflicting results abound in the literature. A relevant analysis of published results as well as the experimental procedures is therefore needed, also in view of the critical interest of TrxR inhibitors. We review the inhibitors of TrxR and related flavoreductases and the classical treatment of reversible, competitive, non competitive and uncompetitive inhibition with respect to TrxR, and in some cases we are able to reconcile contradictory results generated by oversimplified data analysis."

                            "Antibody disulfide bond reduction during monoclonal antibody (mAb) production is a phenomenon that has been attributed to the reducing enzymes from CHO cells acting on the mAb during the harvest process. However, the impact of antibody reduction on the downstream purification process has not been studied. During the production of an IgG2 mAb, antibody reduction was observed in the harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF), resulting in high fragment levels. In addition, aggregate levels increased during the low pH treatment step in the purification process. A correlation between the level of free thiol in the HCCF (as a result of antibody reduction) and aggregation during the low pH step was established, wherein higher levels of free thiol in the starting sample resulted in increased levels of aggregates during low pH treatment. The elevated levels of free thiol were not reduced over the course of purification, resulting in carry\u2010over of high free thiol content into the formulated drug substance. When the drug substance with high free thiols was monitored for product degradation at room temperature and 2\u20138\u00b0C, faster rates of aggregation were observed compared to the drug substance generated from HCCF that was purified immediately after harvest. Further, when antibody reduction mitigations (e.g., chilling, aeration, and addition of cystine) were applied, HCCF could be held for an extended period of time while providing the same product quality/stability as material that had been purified immediately after harvest.

                            "The manufacturing of biotechnology products is a complex logistical process that connects multiple unit operations and often leads to lengthy in-process hold times or bulk drug substance storage. Identification of appropriate storage conditions and optimized buffer systems for biopharmaceutical proteins is essential in ensuring the stability of these products and therefore maintaining the purity, potency, safety, and efficacy of these drug substances throughout the manufacturing process. A typical purification scheme for monoclonal antibodies involves Protein A affinity chromatography followed by polishing chromatography and filtration steps, with an end product of concentrated antibody in a mild acid to neutral pH solution, prior to drug substance formulation. Selection of a suitable buffer system that mitigates physical and chemical degredation of monoclonal antibodies, especially one that minimizes aggregate and particle formation is an important consideration for efficient downstream fill-finish operations and long-term stability (Zheng et al., 2006). Parameters that are typically studied include solution pH, buffering system, inclusion of saccharides, tonicity agents, detergents, and other excipients (Uchiyama, 2014)(Daugherty et al., 2006)."

This complexity is a major impediment to the successful adoption of continuous processing in biopharma manufacturing, despite the significant advantages it offers in terms of process economics and manufacturing capacity. Major challenges in automation, process scheduling, process monitoring, and real-time process correction need to be overcome. Furthermore, CPV requires sophisticated systems for the storage, retrieval, and real-time analysis of data that can handle all the heterogenous sources of data from the process equipment, analytical instruments, in-line sensors, and operator actions, all of which need to be organized and converted from various file formats and locations (such as tabular files, images, spectra, distributed file systems, and run logs).

(Prabhu et al., 2018) Furthermore, inline monitoring of mAb aggregation in cell culture were demonstrated 165,(McAvan et al., 2020) to provide relief to purification efforts and improve process yield.

                            "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a rapidly expanding market for biotherapeutics. Structural changes in the mAb can lead to unwanted immunogenicity, reduced efficacy, and loss of material during production. The pharmaceutical sector requires new protein characterization tools that are fast, applicable in situ and to the manufacturing process. Raman has been highlighted as a technique to suit this application as it is information-rich, minimally invasive, insensitive to water background and requires little to no sample preparation. This study investigates the applicability of Raman to detect Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) and degradation seen in mAbs. IgG4 molecules have been incubated under a range of conditions known to result in degradation of the therapeutic including varied pH, temperature, agitation, photo, and chemical stresses. Aggregation was measured using size-exclusion chromatography, and PTM levels were calculated using peptide mapping. By combining principal component analysis (PCA) with Raman spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy structural analysis we were able to separate proteins based on PTMs and degradation. Furthermore, by identifying key bands that lead to the PCA separation we could correlate spectral peaks to specific PTMs. In particular, we have identified a peak which exhibits a shift in samples with higher levels of Trp oxidation. Through separation of IgG4 aggregates, by size, we have shown a linear correlation between peak wavenumbers of specific functional groups and the amount of aggregate present. We therefore demonstrate the capability for Raman spectroscopy to be used as an analytical tool to measure degradation and PTMs in-line with therapeutic production."

Product appearance, i.e., the state and color of a product, is a required specification for release and can be a simple test to identify product or process impurities.

This method, referred to as ChromiCE, utilizes analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), performed under reducing and denaturing conditions, followed by imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF) of the chromatographically separated heavy and light chains. Under conditions suitable for the subsequent icIEF analysis, the absolute and relative SEC elution volumes of the heavy and light chains were found to be highly pH dependent, a phenomenon that can be exploited in optimizing chromatographic separation. Compared to 2D-PAGE, the ChromiCE method substantially decreases the time and labor needed to complete the analysis, improves reproducibility, and provides fully quantitative assessment of charge heterogeneity. The ChromiCE methodology was applied to a set of diverse monoclonal antibodies to demonstrate suitability for quantitative charge variant analysis of heavy and light chains. A typical application of ChromiCE in extended characterization and stability studies of a purified antibody is shown."

Quality by Design (QbD) has emerged as a fundamental strategy that delivers more robust and scalable manufacturing processes. This approach involves real-time monitoring of critical parameters, which ensures consistent product quality and reduces batch-to-batch variability <Paper corpusId=\"267357351\" paperTitle=\"(Aru et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The QbD methodology represents a shift from traditional quality-by-testing approaches to a more proactive, systematic process development framework that builds robustness into manufacturing processes.\n\nProcess characterization studies (PCS) have become essential tools for demonstrating process robustness and justifying appropriate control ranges. These studies systematically investigate relationships between process parameters, performance metrics, and product quality attributes, providing a scientific foundation for manufacturing decisions <Paper corpusId=\"7587981\" paperTitle=\"(Harmsen et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This knowledge-based approach enables manufacturers to predict how changes in process conditions might affect product quality, allowing for more informed process control strategies.\n\nDespite these advances, maintaining consistent product quality across different variables remains challenging. Manufacturers must ensure consistency across cell age, between different cell banks, and when producing antibodies in different vessels, at different manufacturing sites, or at different scales. These challenges frequently emerge during process transfers, scale-up operations, or following changes in raw material sourcing, highlighting the importance of robust quality control throughout the entire product lifecycle <Paper corpusId=\"52823137\" paperTitle=\"(Loebrich et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, ensuring batch-to-batch reproducibility presents two fundamental challenges. First, manufacturers must identify the most robust operational procedure within regulatory constraints. Second, they must implement feedback control systems to eliminate randomly occurring disturbances while following this robust process path. Traditional biopharmaceutical production processes have historically demonstrated significant variability compared to other industrial processes, making these control strategies particularly crucial <Paper corpusId=\"6142066\" paperTitle=\"(Jenzsch et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe complexity of modern monoclonal antibody manufacturing has prompted the development of advanced monitoring and control systems. Current production processes are characterized by numerous critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) that require sophisticated monitoring. While continuous processing offers significant advantages in process economics and manufacturing capacity, its widespread adoption faces obstacles including challenges in automation, process scheduling, monitoring, and real-time correction. Continuous process verification (CPV) requires sophisticated data management systems capable of handling heterogeneous data sources from process equipment, analytical instruments, in-line sensors, and operator actions. Manual execution of these activities is impractical over extended manufacturing campaigns, driving the industry toward increased automation and digital integration <Paper corpusId=\"270524068\" paperTitle=\"(Thakur et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese modern approaches collectively represent a fundamental shift in manufacturing philosophy\u2014from reactive quality testing to proactive quality design and continuous verification\u2014that addresses the inherent variability in biologics production while meeting increasingly stringent regulatory expectations for product consistency and quality.",

This is achieved mainly through systematic process development and understanding. Once a process is locked and ahead of consistency runs at the intended commercial scale, process characterization studies (PCS hereafter) further contribute to the demonstration of process robustness and the justification of process control ranges. These studies characterize the relationship between process parameters and process performance as well as product quality attributes."

Hence, production processes for biologics are approved by authorities only with clearly defined constraints on their manufacturing procedures. Consequently, reproducibility is of utmost importance. Additionally, reproducibility is very important as it affects the downstream processing and thus quality of the final product. \n\nFrom the engineering point of view there are two challenges in guaranteeing batch-to-batch reproducibility. First of all, within the given constraints, the operational procedure, most robust with respect to typically appearing process fluctuations, must be found. And, secondly, while running the process along this robust path, the remaining randomly appearing disturbances must be eliminated by means of feedback control. \n\nWith respect to batch-to-batch reproducibility, production processes for recombinant proteins are lagging far behind most other industrial processes. Figure 1 shows a typical example of the repeatability of biomass concentration profiles in a recombinant protein production process. The variability is quite high."

Biopharma products and processes are characterized by the presence of large number of CQAs and CPPs, respectively. All of these need to be monitored and controlled in order to produce a safe and efficacious mAb product. This complexity is a major impediment to the successful adoption of continuous processing in biopharma manufacturing, despite the significant advantages it offers in terms of process economics and manufacturing capacity. Major challenges in automation, process scheduling, process monitoring, and real-time process correction need to be overcome. Furthermore, CPV requires sophisticated systems for the storage, retrieval, and real-time analysis of data that can handle all the heterogenous sources of data from the process equipment, analytical instruments, in-line sensors, and operator actions, all of which need to be organized and converted from various file formats and locations (such as tabular files, images, spectra, distributed file systems, and run logs). Carrying out all these activities manually, including data logging, organization, monitoring, statistical analysis, process supervision, and real-time control, is not feasible over long continuous campaigns without introducing multiple errors."
