The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.",

                    "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

It is important to note that formation of non-polar lipid structures, such as LNPs/Liposomes, depends not only on the hydrophobic interaction of non-polar lipids but also on the van der Waals forces of interaction among lipid tails of constituent lipids [53]. Lipids with shorter carbon chains therefore have a lower binding force with the lipid assembly and have more chances of breaking out of the lipid arrangement [54]. An additional trigger for this lipid release from the nanoparticle system could be the large PEG overhang on shorter carbon chain lipids on the nanoparticle surface which is highly water soluble. Another factor that can be used for PEG shedding is branching or unsaturation in the carbon chains, which limit lipid packing and reduce the melting point and subsequently the stability/lipid desorption in vivo [55]. Whatever the PEG shedding method, once the PEG layer is removed, the exposed LNP surface can freely interact with the target membranes.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.\n## PEG Shedding\nThe PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.\n...\nOne such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components. It is important to note that formation of non-polar lipid structures, such as LNPs/Liposomes, depends not only on the hydrophobic interaction of non-polar lipids but also on the van der Waals forces of interaction among lipid tails of constituent lipids [53]. Lipids with shorter carbon chains therefore have a lower binding force with the lipid assembly and have more chances of breaking out of the lipid arrangement [54]. An additional trigger for this lipid release from the nanoparticle system could be the large PEG overhang on shorter carbon chain lipids on the nanoparticle surface which is highly water soluble. Another factor that can be used for PEG shedding is branching or unsaturation in the carbon chains, which limit lipid packing and reduce the melting point and subsequently the stability/lipid desorption in vivo [55]. Whatever the PEG shedding method, once the PEG layer is removed, the exposed LNP surface can freely interact with the target membranes.",

The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time.

                    "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

                    "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.\n## Introduction\nPrevious studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.\n\n## Discussion\nRecently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

However, while clinically approved to treat a small number of diseases, the full potential of nucleic acid therapeutics is hampered by inefficient delivery. Nucleic acids are large, highly charged biomolecules that are sensitive to degradation and so the approaches to deliver these molecules differ significantly from traditional small molecule drugs. Current studies suggest less than 1% of the injected nucleic acid dose is delivered to the target cell in an active form. This inefficient delivery increases costs and limits their use to applications where a small amount of nucleic acid is sufficient. In this review, we focus on two of the major barriers to efficient nucleic acid delivery: (1) delivery to the target cell and (2) transport to the subcellular compartment where the nucleic acids are therapeutically active. We explore how nanoparticles can be modified with targeting ligands to increase accumulation in specific cells, and how the composition of the nanoparticle can be engineered to manipulate or disrupt cellular membranes and facilitate delivery to the optimal subcellular compartments. Finally, we highlight how with intelligent material design, nanoparticle delivery systems have been developed to deliver nucleic acids that silence aberrant genes, correct genetic mutations, and act as both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines.

The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

Dilliard, D. Siegwart\n## Abstract\nNucleic acids for gene silencing, expression and editing can precisely target disease at the molecular level but require effective delivery systems. This Review discusses the material and biological principles used to design delivery systems to target specific organs in the body. Genetic drugs based on nucleic acid biomolecules are a rapidly emerging class of medicines that directly reprogramme the central dogma of biology to prevent and treat disease. However, multiple biological barriers normally impede\u00a0the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids, necessitating the use of a delivery system. Lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent leading approaches for the clinical translation of genetic drugs. These systems circumnavigate biological barriers and facilitate the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids in the correct cells of the target organ using passive, active and endogenous targeting mechanisms. In this Review, we highlight the constituent materials of these advanced nanoparticles, their nucleic acid cargoes and how they journey through the body. We discuss targeting principles for liver delivery, as it is the organ most successfully targeted by intravenously administered nanoparticles to date, followed by the expansion of these concepts to extrahepatic (non-liver) delivery. Ultimately, this Review connects emerging materials and biological insights playing key roles in targeting specific organs and cells in vivo.\n## Review article\nof studies on nanoparticle organ targeting have focused on how plasma proteins impact delivery outcomes. The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.",

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.\n## PEGylated lipid-Modulating serum protein adsorption for tissue targeting\nSuzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.Specifically, faster PEG shedding led to attenuated production of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicating that optimization of the kinetics of PEG shedding can improve the circulation and biodistribution of LNPs in the body.Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of siRNA-loaded LNPs could be influenced by the desorption rate of PEG.It is essential to understand the kinetics of PEG dissociation, as it directly impacts the duration and effectiveness of the therapeutic payload in target tissues.Mui et al. [35] first investigated the gene knockdown efficiency associated with PEG length and PEG content within LNPs.Their group found that hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes were proportional to the PEG alkyl length.Specifically, when fixing PEG content at 1.5%, C16 and C18 PEG need more time to shed from the surface of LNPs compared to C14 PEG.When increasing the PEG content from 1.5% to 3%, C14 PEG LNPs showed a gradual decline in gene knockdown, while C18 PEG completely lost its function when its content was higher than 1.5%.This phenomenon can be attributed to the longer alkyl length of C18 PEG, which increased the hydrophobicity of PEG lipid, and hindered the interaction with the cell membrane.As a result, longer alkyl length required more energy for LNPs to adopt a monolayer transition state, leading to shedding of PEG from the LNP surface.Thus, C18 PEG has a longer circulation time after administration but still holds its ability with 1.5% threshold concentration.\n\nIn another aspect, PEG shedding is due to the pH change during the endocytosis process.A study by Hashiba and colleagues [68] demonstrated the benefits of pH-labile PEGylation in siRNA-loaded LNPs for hepatocyte targeting and gene silencing activity.The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.\n...\nFor instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona.LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor.The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance.\n\nIn conclusion, PEGylated lipids play multiple roles in enhancing the performance of LNPs as drug delivery systems for therapeutic mRNA.Through studies that examined PEG shedding rates, protein corona formation, and pH-labile PEGylation, researchers have gained valuable insights into optimizing the effectiveness of LNPs by manipulating surface PEG.These advancements in PEGylation strategies hold promise for the design of precise and efficient delivery systems for therapeutic nucleic acid, especially mRNA.\n\n## Emerging technologies boosting the tissue targeting efficacy\nIn the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

                    "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

Sahay\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Surface composition\nDelivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

Almurshedi\n## Abstract\nThere has been increased interest in the development of RNA-based vaccines for protection against various infectious diseases and also for cancer immunotherapies. Rapid and cost-effective manufacturing methods in addition to potent immune responses observed in preclinical and clinical studies have made mRNA-based vaccines promising alternatives to conventional vaccine technologies. However, efficient delivery of these vaccines requires that the mRNA be protected against extracellular degradation. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively studied as non-viral vectors for the delivery of mRNA to target cells because of their relatively easy and scalable manufacturing processes. This review highlights key advances in the development of LNPs and reviews the application of mRNA-based vaccines formulated in LNPs for use against infectious diseases and cancer.\n## Colloidal Stability of Formulations\nConventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

In the current work, we aimed to investigate the impact of formulation type on biodistribution profile for two clinically relevant nanoformulations. We performed a comparative study of biodistribution in healthy rats at several dose levels and durations up to 14-day post-injection. The studied nanoformulations were nanostructured lipid carriers incorporating the fluorescent dye IR780-oleyl, and polymeric nanoparticles containing the anticancer agent cabazitaxel. The biodistribution was approximated by quantification of the cargo in blood and relevant organs. Several clear and systematic differences in biodistribution were observed, with the most pronounced being a much higher (more than 50-fold) measured concentration ratio between cabazitaxel in all organs vs. blood, as compared to IR780-oleyl. Normalized dose linearity largely showed opposite trends between the two compounds after injection. Cabazitaxel showed a higher brain accumulation than IR780-oleyl with increasing dose injected. Interestingly, cabazitaxel showed a notable and prolonged accumulation in lung tissue compared to other organs. The latter observations could warrant further studies towards a possible therapeutic indication within lung and conceivably brain cancer for nanoformulations of this highly antineoplastic compound, for which off-target toxicity is currently dose-limiting in the clinic.",

                    "text": "This is exacerbated by the slower elimination of IR780-oleyl from the blood stream (Fig. 1), and the stabilization towards a relatively high (> 25 ng/mL) residual concentration. Besides the marker dose applied, several factors could influence this difference between the two delivery systems, PEBCA and LipImage. Physicochemical aspects such as size, chemical composition of the nanoparticle and surface coverage of PEG are known to influence targeting; e.g. for LNPs, Dilliard et al. investigated the extrahepatic targeting, and proposed a mechanism where shedding of PEG from the particle surface is followed by selective interactions with plasma proteins, based on the chemical identity of the lipids present, and eventually tissue targeting based on the adsorbed proteins [37]. In our work, it could be noted that the length distribution of PEG moieties in the LipImage formulation is slightly shifted towards longer PEG than in the PEBCA formulation. Anselmo et al. [38] showed that for polymeric nanoparticles, material elasticity did influence circulation time and cellular uptake. Another factor that could strongly influence biodistribution of the nanoparticle payload (Cbz, IR780-oleyl) is the extent to which it exists as released, free compound, as opposed to encapsulated in the nanoparticle. Release can, in turn, happen along several routes, either by diffusion from (an intact) particle, by gradual erosion, or by complete dissociation of the particle. Release kinetics of drug molecules from therapeutic nanoparticles can vary dramatically and is influenced by PEGylation and protein corona, especially for hydrophobic drugs and a release diffusion-based release mechanism [39,40]. Thus, it becomes important to try to quantify which fraction of the payload is released, and which is still encapsulated. At the same time, quantification of the intactness of organic nanoparticles in vivo is very challenging, e.g. due to the presence of high concentrations of plasma proteins that can severely affect light scattering-based particle detection techniques.",

Vandebriel, F. Caputo, W. D. De Jong, C. Delmaar, A. Hyldbakk, Emilie Rustique, Ruth Schmid, Sofie Snipstad, I. Texier, K. Vernstad, S. Borgos\n## Abstract\nBiodistribution of nanoencapsulated bioactive compounds is primarily determined by the size, shape, chemical composition and surface properties of the encapsulating nanoparticle, and, thus, less dependent on the physicochemical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient encapsulated. In the current work, we aimed to investigate the impact of formulation type on biodistribution profile for two clinically relevant nanoformulations. We performed a comparative study of biodistribution in healthy rats at several dose levels and durations up to 14-day post-injection. The studied nanoformulations were nanostructured lipid carriers incorporating the fluorescent dye IR780-oleyl, and polymeric nanoparticles containing the anticancer agent cabazitaxel. The biodistribution was approximated by quantification of the cargo in blood and relevant organs. Several clear and systematic differences in biodistribution were observed, with the most pronounced being a much higher (more than 50-fold) measured concentration ratio between cabazitaxel in all organs vs. blood, as compared to IR780-oleyl. Normalized dose linearity largely showed opposite trends between the two compounds after injection. Cabazitaxel showed a higher brain accumulation than IR780-oleyl with increasing dose injected. Interestingly, cabazitaxel showed a notable and prolonged accumulation in lung tissue compared to other organs. The latter observations could warrant further studies towards a possible therapeutic indication within lung and conceivably brain cancer for nanoformulations of this highly antineoplastic compound, for which off-target toxicity is currently dose-limiting in the clinic.\n## Large differences in blood vs. organ accumulation could be related to drug release\nThis is exacerbated by the slower elimination of IR780-oleyl from the blood stream (Fig. 1), and the stabilization towards a relatively high (> 25 ng/mL) residual concentration. Besides the marker dose applied, several factors could influence this difference between the two delivery systems, PEBCA and LipImage. Physicochemical aspects such as size, chemical composition of the nanoparticle and surface coverage of PEG are known to influence targeting; e.g. for LNPs, Dilliard et al. investigated the extrahepatic targeting, and proposed a mechanism where shedding of PEG from the particle surface is followed by selective interactions with plasma proteins, based on the chemical identity of the lipids present, and eventually tissue targeting based on the adsorbed proteins [37]. In our work, it could be noted that the length distribution of PEG moieties in the LipImage formulation is slightly shifted towards longer PEG than in the PEBCA formulation. Anselmo et al. [38] showed that for polymeric nanoparticles, material elasticity did influence circulation time and cellular uptake. Another factor that could strongly influence biodistribution of the nanoparticle payload (Cbz, IR780-oleyl) is the extent to which it exists as released, free compound, as opposed to encapsulated in the nanoparticle. Release can, in turn, happen along several routes, either by diffusion from (an intact) particle, by gradual erosion, or by complete dissociation of the particle. Release kinetics of drug molecules from therapeutic nanoparticles can vary dramatically and is influenced by PEGylation and protein corona, especially for hydrophobic drugs and a release diffusion-based release mechanism [39,40]. Thus, it becomes important to try to quantify which fraction of the payload is released, and which is still encapsulated. At the same time, quantification of the intactness of organic nanoparticles in vivo is very challenging, e.g. due to the presence of high concentrations of plasma proteins that can severely affect light scattering-based particle detection techniques.",

It has been demonstrated that the lipid anchor length determines how long the PEG-lipid remains incorporated in the lipid shell. PEG-lipids with longer anchors are stably included on the surface of the lipid layer and require more time to dissociate from it, thus preventing undesired interactions with proteins and cells, and consequently prolonging nanoparticles' blood circulation time (Zhu et al., 2017). On the other hand, PEGylation with PEG-lipids with longer anchors can negatively affect the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles by inhibiting their interaction with the plasma membrane of the target cells (Zhu et al., 2017). Moreover, PEGylated nanoparticles can be rapidly clear from the circulation upon secondary exposure, as consequence of antibody-mediated immune responses against the PEG component (Judge et al., 2006). Therefore, the use of PEG-lipids with shorter anchors, such as PEGylated 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-DMG, a C14-based lipid), which are gradually released from the surface of nanoparticles, appears to be an extremely successful approach to achieve high colloidal stability and cargo delivery into target cells (Tam et al., 2013). The reason for this is that the PEG-lipid is embedded into the lipid layer by hydrophobic interactions; hence, spontaneous de-PEGylation is a process that can be partially controlled changing their hydrophobic properties (Zhu et al., 2017).",

Using core-shell nanoparticles with a same PEGylated lipid bilayer shell yet cores differing in elasticity (45 kPa \u2013 760 MPa) as models, we isolate the effects of nanoparticle elasticity from those of other physiochemical parameters and, using mouse models, observe a non-monotonic relationship of systemic circulation lifetime versus nanoparticle elasticity. Incubating our nanoparticles in mouse plasma provides protein coronas varying non-monotonically in composition depending on nanoparticle elasticity. Particularly, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) is the only protein whose relative abundance in corona strongly correlates with our nanoparticles\u2019 blood clearance lifetime. Notably, similar results are observed when above nanoparticles\u2019 PEGylated lipid bilayer shell is changed to be non-PEGylated. This work unveils the mechanisms by which nanoparticle elasticity affects nanoparticles\u2019 physiological fate and suggests nanoparticle elasticity as a readily tunable parameter in future rational exploiting of protein corona. Nanoparticle elasticity is known to affect physiological fate but how this occurs is largely unknown. Here, the authors report on a study using nanoparticles differing in elasticity alone to show a difference in the protein corona, in particular apolipoprotein A-1 absorption, corresponds to differences in circulation time.\n",

            "text": "PEG represents an ideal crosslinker for covalent attachment of targeting ligands because of the availability of many different end groups [12] . PEG also mediates stealth effects in vivo reducing serum protein adsorption and consequently resulting in a prolonged blood circulation time. These effects are dependent on the density and the molecular weight of the linear PEG [13] . \n\nSerum protein adsorption with formation of a protein corona occurs whenever NPs get into contact with biological fluids like blood, result-ing in a new NP biological identity [ 5 , 14 , 15 ]. Hence, blood circulation time, biodistribution and targeting of nanocarriers can be influenced. The NP characteristics like size, shape and surface composition, as well as environmental parameters like temperature and type of fluid can affect the composition of the protein corona [ 16 , 17 ]. Corona proteins can either act as opsonins and mark NPs for rapid recognition by the reticuloendothelial system or they act as dysopsonins mediating longer blood circulation times [18] . As PEG can reduce protein adsorption, but not completely prevent it, the formation of a protein corona around the NPs has to be considered for successful active targeting. \n\nThe aim of this study was on the one hand to analyze the effect of different PEG spacers with varying length for ligand coupling on active targeting. On the other hand, we aimed to characterize the protein corona formed around these NPs and its influence on the active targeting capability. We demonstrated that both serum protein adsorption and selection of the PEG spacer for the targeting moiety have an effect on active targeting and also influence each other.",

This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

The stealth sheath modulates the formation of this corona in a fashion that is not completely understood and has been a point of contention in the field for several decades. Regarding PEGylation, it was originally thought that it inhibits protein adhesion (Du et al., 1997;Bradley et al., 1998) then others found evidence that it actually accelerates protein corona formation (Szebeni et al., 2002) and yet others argued that they found evidence it had no effect (Price et al., 2001). It has been argued that the PEG sheath preferentially binds the common bloodstream protein albumin (Vert and Domurado, 2000) creating an albumin protein corona that, itself, acts as the stealth sheath that inhibits complement activation (Caracciolo, 2015). Alternate protective mechanisms unrelated to the protein corona have also been proposed, including direct inhibition of absorption by macrophages (Price et al., 2001). Most recently, evidence has been found that the formation of the protein corona is essential for the stealth properties of PEG (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). The most recent reviews of this much discussed topic are found here (Nienhaus and Nienhaus, 2019;Zhadanov, 2019;Li Z. et al., 2020).\n\nComplement activation and the formation of a protein corona is only one aspect of the environment that the nanoparticle must traverse; in addition to the body's defenses the nanoparticle must navigate the hydrodynamic environment of the bloodstream and, in most cases, deliver the payload drug through the cell membrane.

            "text": "When in contact with biological fluids, nanoparticles dynamically absorb biomolecules like proteins and lipids onto their surface, forming a \u201ccorona\u201d. This biocorona is a dynamic and complex structure that determines how host cells respond to nanoparticles. Despite the common use of mouse models in pre-clinical and toxicological experiments, the impact of corona formed in mouse serum on the biophysical and biological properties of different size NP has not been thoroughly explored. Furthering the knowledge on the corona formed on NP exposed to mouse serum proteins can help in understanding what role it might have in in vivo studies at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels. To investigate biocorona formation, different sized polystyrene NP were exposed to mouse serum. Our data show a size- and time-dependent protein and lipid corona formation. Several proteins were identified and apolipoproteins were by far the most common group on the NPs surfaces. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol and triglycerides effectively bind to NP emphasizing that proteins are not the only biomolecules with high-affinity binding to nanomaterial surfaces. These results highlight that further knowledge on NP interactions with mouse serum is necessary regarding the common use of this model to predict the in vivo efficiency of NP.",

            "text": "Natural or synthetic nanoparticles such as liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanosheets, and polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been widely studied for delivering genes, drugs, or sensing molecules to specific cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. When these nanoparticles pass through the bloodstream, they encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, leading to the formation of a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface called the \"protein corona\" [10][11][12]. The protein corona consists of a hard corona (irreversible binding between proteins and the nanoparticle surface, forming the first layer adjacent to the nanoparticle) and a soft corona (reversible binding between proteins, forming a low-density protein layer between the hard corona and the water region) [10,11]. Protein corona modulates the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, thereby influencing their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting efficiency, which can either enhance or reduce drug delivery efficiency [13][14][15][16]. For instance, the protein corona can guide nanoparticles toward specific cell surfaces composed of receptors with a high affinity for the protein corona [17]. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be pre-coated with a specific protein in vitro, which directs subsequent protein adsorption in vivo through protein-protein interactions, resulting in a dual-layered protein corona structure that influences the fate of nanoparticles in the body [18]. \n\nTo control protein corona formation, nanoparticles are often modified by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which sterically shield nanoparticles from plasma proteins [19,20]. However, grafting PEG at high concentrations destabilizes nanoparticle stability and blocks ligand molecules, limiting the amount of PEG that can be grafted [21][22][23]. Therefore, PEGylation cannot entirely prevent protein corona formation, Pharmaceutics 2024, 16 making it essential to understand this process.",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

            "text": "rin, the time needed is approximately 0.2 min [61].  A slight increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles was observed. The major variation was showed for NP-DMSA (from 32 to 67 nm), probably due to its stronger negative surface charge compared with PEG-coated NPs. In the case of PEG-conjugated particles, they exhibited a size increase from 67 to 113 nm. As observed in Figure 2b, the size distribution of the nanoparticles remained relatively stable up to 30 min and below 200 nm in physiological conditions, which is an important requirement for in vivo intravenous administration. Kinetic studies showed a rapid formation of the protein corona. In all cases, the increase in hydrodynamic size was observed after 1 min of incubation of the NPs in presence of plasma. An atomistic description of such a complex mechanism of formation and evolution of the protein corona around the NPs is, at the moment, unfeasible. Nevertheless, some computational simulations and in vitro experiments have been used to describe the interaction between NPs and a few components of the plasma [60,61]. The mechanism of formation of the corona around the NP can be divided in to two main steps: (a) the NPs enter in the biological media and encounter biomolecules that first adsorb forming the initial corona and (b) the corona composition changes dynamically due to the competition between proteins. Also, protein-protein interactions may affect the overall kinetics of this process. For example, in the case of silica-coated NPs, the time needed to achieve 50% of the surface coated with Human serum albumin (HSA) is around 0.1 min, whilst if the analysis is done with HSA and transferrin, the time needed is approximately 0.2 min [61].",

            "text": "In addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.In numerous cases, the carbon anchor length dictates the PEG detachment, as exemplified in LNPs.When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h \u22121 ) to the chain length was observed. [21]This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths.Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking.\n\nUltimate limitations inherent to active targeting pertain to the impact of an anchored targeting motif on PEGylated NPs, including its potential to alter the protein corona or the possibility for the ligand to be buried beneath the layer of adsorbed proteins.This discouraging outcome has been observed with transferrintargeted PEG-silica NPs by Dawson and colleagues. [25]Chan and colleagues have proposed an alternative approach to ensure the active ligand exposure by introducing shorter PEG additionally to the longer, ligand-carrying PEG chains. [26]Although there is an increasing interest in how active targeting approaches are hindered by protein corona formation, most studies focus on in vitro formation and target recognition.Considering the critical importance of the biological identity of NPs in vivo, improved understanding thereof is necessary. [27]here is a substantial lack of attempts to correlate the in vivo protein corona profile to the actual biodistribution of administered NPs, a matter of utmost importance that needs to be addressed to improve translational advances of delivery systems.Improved methodology regarding the recollection of coronacoated NPs might solve one of the intricacies contributing to this knowledge gap.\n\nIn addition to the problems highlighted above, from the experimental point of view, the results reported about protein corona should be cautiously interpreted, considering that the PEG-protein corona formation is highly dependent on study conditions.

            "text": "Interestingly, pegylation slightly decreases the SC surface mass density but does not influence the HC, and no significant difference is observed between the two pegylated formulations for SC or HC. However, the percentage protein-to-lipid ratios show that the pegylated formulation F3 accumulated almost twice the molar amount of proteins per amount of lipid comparing to F2, again most likely a reflection of the amphiphilic nature of ICG and its clustering within PEG. Several authors have noted that the corona continues to evolve under in vivo relevant conditions, where the amount of biomolecular species is not limited by scarcity and where biological processes affect the corona during its passage through different biological compartments (i.e. immune activation and enzymatic modifications). 50,51 In our measurements, neither of the pegylated formulations saturated during the ca. 20 min incubation period (Fig. 4 and S9 \u2020). Considering that all our formulations tested positive for traces of endotoxins, it is probable that these surfaces induced complement system activation, which can increase the amount of bound biomolecules by as much as 25% due to surface deposition of opsonins. 52,53 The slight differences between F2 and F3 in thickness and surface mass density, and the clear difference in protein-to-lipid ratios between the pegylated formulations demonstrate that ICG influences corona formation. Overall, the mass accumulated per area is very similar for all SC and HC, respectively, whereas clear differences between the liposome formulations are seen when the amount of bound protein is compared to the amount of lipid. The replicate data calculations are provided as ESI Table M1. \u2020 Corona studies generally employ static incubation conditions where protein adsorption reaches equilibrium quickly. 50 For instance, Walczyk et al. reported HC thicknesses of 11-12 nm before and 10.5 nm after extensive washing for differential centrifugal sedimentation isolated 100 nm surface-carboxylated polystyrene NPs, measured using TEM and DLS. 54",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been significant advancement in comprehending the corona-mediated in vivo fate and its correlation with NP composition.However, the strategies to manipulate the protein corona remain limited, with PEGylation being the main strategy to extend blood circulation time as evidenced the number of marketed PEGylated NPs. [17,18]This scenario is also in agreement with the good regulatory profile of PEG.\n\nNumerous studies have attempted to delineate the optimal composition and configuration of PEGylated surfaces for minimizing protein corona formation.Among the factors influencing protein adsorption, PEG length and its density, as well as conformation on the surface of NPs have been recognized for decades.More recently, the PEG desorption kinetics and the presence of an active targeting motif have been analyzed as key determinants of protein corona formation.These factors cannot be viewed independently from the described carrier system, making definitive conclusions challenging.However, general trends can be discerned.In spite of the incapacity to agree on the ideal PEG density as particle size and outer shell composition, among others, also play into the equation, high PEG densities have been linked to reduced protein adsorption. [18,19]Nevertheless, this observation requires careful consideration since the units employed to describe these technologies hinder direct comparisons.For instance, a PEG 2k density of 10 lipid mol% was found to reduce the ApoE adsorption in lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs). [19]Similar conclusions have been drawn for PEG-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) self-assemblies, with densities of 0.45 PEG 5k chains nm \u22122 leading to reduced adsorption of ApoE. [18]Similar trends regarding increased PEG density resulting in decreased protein adsorption were observed for inorganic NPs. [20]Although PEG density holds greater importance than its length, a threshold of between 2 and 5 kDa has been established for optimal stealth properties.However, this conclusion has been based on specific types of PEGylated materials and nanocarriers and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated in a generic form.\n\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

This is a well-studied phenomenon for parenterally administered nanoparticles for which the systemic transport and biodistribution of nanoparticles is strongly influenced by the formation of a serum-protein corona [24]. In contrast, corona formation in GI fluids still remains understudied. Although one recent study has explored the influence of particle properties in this context [25\u2022\u2022], more studies are needed to understand the dynamic interaction of digestive enzymes with inorganic nanoparticles and their impact on GI toxicity and cellular uptake.

            "text": "During the circulation with blood, various opsonic proteins would be adsorbed onto the surface of nanoparticles and form a protein corona. 2,26 Subsequently, nanoparticles with protein adsorption would undergo size increase and unavoidable aggregation. To better mimic the blood plasma environment and precisely assess the protein adsorption onto the nanoparticles, we incubated the micelles with mouse blood plasma and monitored the alteration of size and size distribution of the protein-micelle complex at 37\u00b0C with DLS. As shown in Figure 5, the size and size distribution of PEG-75 increased with time after incubation with serum. The small size of several nm to 20 nm could be attributed to the high concentration of serum proteins scattered in the solution. For PEG-0, as shown in Figure S5, the average size of around 70 nm changed little, but the size distribution became much wider than the original micelle. Similar results were also observed with PEG-25, PEG-50, and PEG-75. However, the size of these three types of micelles became more than 100 nm after 10 hours of incubation, much larger   than the corresponding micelles in the absence of serum. Furthermore, the intensity of serum proteins contributed less intensity than PEG-0 one, indicating much more protein was adsorbed onto the micelles of PEG-25, PEG-50, and PEG-75. Meanwhile, the size and shape of the protein-adsorbed micelles were measured by TEM ( Figure S3). Compared with the original micelles, the protein-adsorbed micelles became relatively larger, with a clear staining of the protein layer by uranyl-acetate.\n\nTo investigate the protein adsorption efficiency of different micelles, the same amount of micelles was incubated with an equal volume of mouse serum for 2 hours. Upon being centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 45 minutes, free proteins were removed and the supernatants were collected to determine the protein concentration via Bradford assay. The protein adsorption efficiency of micelles was accordingly determined as summarized in Figure 6. In contrast to the well documented finding that PEGylation reduces protein adsorption, unexpected results were observed from these PEGylated micelles. For different micelles, the",

Once in contact with a biological environment, nanosized objects immediately interact with the surrounding biomolecules, which can adsorb on the nanoparticle surface, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona. 7,8 Some of the biomolecules in this layer associate with the nanoparticle surface almost irreversibly, affecting de facto the subsequent behavior. For instance, it has been shown that the formation of the corona can affect nanomaterial stability and biodistribution, macrophage sequestration, immune system activation, cellular recognition, and nanomaterial final fate. 9\u221211 In some cases, the formation of a biomolecular corona can also affect the specificity of targeted drugs, by masking targeting ligands attached to the nanocarrier. 12,13 Polymers such as poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are usually grafted on the nanoparticle surface to partially reduce protein binding and subsequent macrophage sequestration. 14\u221216 However, recent work suggested that the so-called stealth effect is actually conferred by specific corona proteins adsorbed on PEGylated surfaces. 17 At the same time, researchers are also trying to exploit the biomolecular corona as a targeting strategy to direct nanoparticles toward specific cellular routes. 18\u221220 So far, corona formation and its composition have been widely investigated. 21\u221224 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed",

It is important to note that formation of non-polar lipid structures, such as LNPs/Liposomes, depends not only on the hydrophobic interaction of non-polar lipids but also on the van der Waals forces of interaction among lipid tails of constituent lipids [53]. Lipids with shorter carbon chains therefore have a lower binding force with the lipid assembly and have more chances of breaking out of the lipid arrangement [54]. An additional trigger for this lipid release from the nanoparticle system could be the large PEG overhang on shorter carbon chain lipids on the nanoparticle surface which is highly water soluble. Another factor that can be used for PEG shedding is branching or unsaturation in the carbon chains, which limit lipid packing and reduce the melting point and subsequently the stability/lipid desorption in vivo [55]. Whatever the PEG shedding method, once the PEG layer is removed, the exposed LNP surface can freely interact with the target membranes.",

            "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

            "text": "In order to reach their receptors in vivo, nanoparticles will be first exposed to a complex biological fluid, such as for instance serum. In this environment, various proteins and other biomolecules will adsorb on the nanoparticle surface forming a biomolecular corona. This layer will then replace the synthetic identity of bare nanoparticles and in some cases it can mask the ligands of functionalized nanoparticles, which may result in the loss of targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015). Additionally, some proteins with high binding affinity can strongly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface for a long period of time, creating a layer called the hard corona. In contrast to the soft corona, where proteins can be easily replaced by other proteins following dynamic changes of the surrounding environment, the hard corona is highly resistant toward such changes. Overall, this complex and dynamic layer confers nanoparticles a new biological identity. The eventual interactions between nanoparticles and cell receptors, thus receptor recognition and nanoparticle uptake, can all be affected by the presence of this layer. Strategies have been developed to prevent the formation of the biomolecular corona and maintain targeting efficiency, for instance, by creating a stealth layer using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other special polymers or by introducing zwitterionic modifications on the nanoparticle surface (Veronese and Pasut, 2005;Yuan et al., 2012;Garc\u00eda et al., 2014;Moyano et al., 2014;Pozzi et al., 2014;Alberg et al., 2020). However, it has been shown that in the case of PEGylated surfaces, nanoparticles still could adsorb proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016a). \n\nGiven the crucial role of the biomolecular corona and cell receptors in mediating nanoparticle uptake and determining their intracellular fate, it is of great importance to study in more detail the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors. Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been found that various 100 nm nanoparticles showed highly significant and specific liver deposition [26]. This condition can greatly reduce the amount of nanocarriers reaching the tumor site, with a relatively short systemic circulation time in the body [27,28]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is widely used to modify drugs or nanocarriers to reduce the protein adsorption and achieve the \"stealth\" effect [29,30]. By engineering a hierarchical PEG structure on nanoparticle surfaces, an alternative mechanism to enhance nanoparticle blood circulation with a half-life varying from 4 to 10 hours has been achieved [31]. Hydration of hydrophilic polyether scaffold reduces the protein adsorption on hydrophobic polymer surface by spatial repulsion. It reduces nonspecific recognition by phagocytosis and prolongs the circulation time by reducing the renal clearance in vivo. However, PEGylation cannot completely inhibit protein adsorption on the surface of nanocarriers [32]. Some proteins, such as serum proteins, are always adsorbed on the surface of nanocarriers. Thus, the surface properties are changed [33]. \n\nRecently, some researchers have analyzed the components of protein corona on the surface of PEGylated nanocarriers after treatment with plasma or serum and found that the clusterin (CLU) expression was most abundant. Compared with human serum albumin-modified nanocarriers, which were significantly taken up by the macrophage, the increase of CLU amount could increase the hydrophobicity of nanoparticles and reduce the adsorption of nonspecific proteins, thereby achieving an antiphagocytosis effect [34]. As a high density lipoprotein existing in plasma [35], CLU was adsorbed to the hydrophilic surface by hydrogen bond to form CLU hard protein corona in vivo. This condition reduced the adsorption of serum albumin [36,37]. In addition, as the only in vivo receptor of CLU, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 is a cell surface protein discovered in recent years [38].",

            "text": "One key biological interaction is protein fouling, or protein corona formation, where proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface upon exposure to serum. This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

            "text": "systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo, toxicity, and targeting capability [27]. In this sense, the change in the particle diameter during the incubation in human plasma may have been due to the destabilization of the system in terms of particle agglomeration, or, more likely, the formation of a protein corona [28]. This phenomenon could be observed at the first time points of the incubation of the formulations, which points to the dynamic process of protein corona formation, i.e., the constant adsorption and desorption of proteins from the particles' surfaces, which is especially emphasized during the formation of the initial, \"soft\" corona [30]. except for NLCPOL, where there was noted a significant change in the z-average diameter after 24 h of incubation time (p = 0.0101; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2a). Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~",

            "text": "In this study, three different nanoparticle coatings were subjected to two different serum types and incubated for 24 h. Gold nanoparticles of 30 nm were purchased from NanoHybrids (Austin, TX, USA). Particles were placed in aqueous dispersions with one of the following coatings: polyethylene glycol (PEG), carboxylic acid (COOH), or amine (NH 3 ). The primary particle size of each nanoparticle was measured as 30 \u00b1 2 nm using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The different coatings provided a variety of charges among the coatings, with the PEG producing a neutrally charged surface, COOH producing a negatively charged surface, and NH 3 producing a positively charged surface. This variance assisted the determination of the effects of surface charge on the formation of the protein corona. The serum types used included fetal bovine, termed serum-type 1 (ST1), and equine, termed serum-type 2 (ST2; Equitech-Bio Inc., Kerrville, TX, USA). Particles were incubated with serum at a 1:1 ratio at 37 \u2022 C for 24 h. Coronas were separated from particles in two steps. First, the particle-corona suspension was centrifuged to remove excess proteins not adhered to particle surfaces. Second, the proteins were removed from the particle surface using a lysis buffer of 8 M urea at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min and then centrifuged to separate the proteins from the nanoparticles.",

            "text": "In order to prevent aggregation and favor a prolonged circulation time of nanoparticles in the bloodstream upon their systemic administration the coating of nanoparticles with a PEGlipid through a process known as \"PEGylation\" is a commonly employed strategy. PEGylated nanoparticles are often referred as \"stealth\" nanoparticles, due their ability to avoid opsonization by serum proteins and detection by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Li and Huang, 2009). \n\nThe selection of the appropriate PEG-lipid is a crucial step in the design of mRNA delivery platforms and can have a huge impact on the carrier activity by shaping its pharmacokinetics. It has been demonstrated that the lipid anchor length determines how long the PEG-lipid remains incorporated in the lipid shell. PEG-lipids with longer anchors are stably included on the surface of the lipid layer and require more time to dissociate from it, thus preventing undesired interactions with proteins and cells, and consequently prolonging nanoparticles' blood circulation time (Zhu et al., 2017). On the other hand, PEGylation with PEG-lipids with longer anchors can negatively affect the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles by inhibiting their interaction with the plasma membrane of the target cells (Zhu et al., 2017). Moreover, PEGylated nanoparticles can be rapidly clear from the circulation upon secondary exposure, as consequence of antibody-mediated immune responses against the PEG component (Judge et al., 2006). Therefore, the use of PEG-lipids with shorter anchors, such as PEGylated 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-DMG, a C14-based lipid), which are gradually released from the surface of nanoparticles, appears to be an extremely successful approach to achieve high colloidal stability and cargo delivery into target cells (Tam et al., 2013). The reason for this is that the PEG-lipid is embedded into the lipid layer by hydrophobic interactions; hence, spontaneous de-PEGylation is a process that can be partially controlled changing their hydrophobic properties (Zhu et al., 2017).",

The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

            "text": "When encountering cultural fluid containing 10% human serum GO-PEG nanoparticles accumulate serum proteins on their surface [24]. This so-called protein corona can sufficiently impact the interaction with monocytes. Protein corona of GO-PEG nanoparticles was studied by SPS-PAGE. One hundred \u00b5g of GO-PEG was incubated in a culture medium containing 10% human serum in concentrations of 5 and 25 \u00b5g/mL. Nanoparticles were collected and washed, then adsorbed proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Amount of adsorbed protein was semi-quantitatively measured by the assessment of total protein band intensity (brightness of corresponding lanes on the stained gel). Decrease of brightness indicated higher amount of adsorbed protein. \n\nAs expected, small nanoparticles adsorbed more protein than larger ones due to larger specific surface area (Figure 3). Nevertheless, PEGylation can not completely diminish protein adsorption on GO nanoparticles. Branched PEG more efficiently shield nanoparticle surfaces, which can be explained by steric hindrance generated by multiple PEG chains. These data are in agreement with previous studies reporting less intense cell attachment [25] and lower protein absorbance [26] for nanoparticles coated with branched PEG. Unexpectedly, we observed that the adsorption of serum proteins positively correlated with the concentration of nanoparticles. Considering that the concentration of protein in 10% serum (6-8 mg/mL) is 100-1000-fold higher than that of GO-PEG, one could expect that the surface of nanoparticles will be saturated with protein molecules regardless of nanoparticle concentration. Even if saturation of the GO-PEG surface was not reached at mentioned protein concentration, nanoparticles at 5 \u00b5L should adsorb more protein because of the higher protein-to-nanoparticle mass ratio. Therefore, an additional experiment was performed. We substituted 10% human serum with 7 mg/mL BSA. When incubating with BSA, GO-PEG adsorbs the same quantity of protein independent of their concentration (Figure S4). Therefore, it can be inferred that blood serum contains some factors facilitating higher protein adsorption at larger GO-PEG concentrations.",

            "text": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.",

            "text": "In this study, three different nanoparticle coatings were subjected to two different serum types and incubated for 24 hours. Gold nanoparticles of 30 nm were purchased from NanoHybrids (Austin, TX, USA). Particles were placed in aqueous dispersions with one of the following coatings: polyethylene glycol (PEG), carboxylic acid (COOH), or amine (NH3). The primary particle size of each nanoparticle was measured as 30 \u00b1 2 nm using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The different coatings provided a variety of charges among the coatings, with the PEG producing a neutrally charged surface, COOH producing a negatively charged surface, and NH3 producing a positively charged surface. This variance assisted the determination of the effects of surface charge on the formation of the protein corona. The serum types used included fetal bovine, termed serumtype 1 (ST1), and equine, termed serum-type 2 (ST2; Equitech-Bio Inc., Kerrville, TX, USA). Particles were incubated with serum at a 1:1 ratio at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours. Coronas were separated from particles in two steps. First, the particle-corona suspension was centrifuged to remove excess proteins not adhered to particle surfaces. Second, the proteins were removed from the particle surface using a lysis buffer of 8 M urea at 95 \u00b0C for 5 minutes and then centrifuged to separate the proteins from the nanoparticles.",

            "text": "To understand corona formation, large numbers of data are available on in vitro studies on the nano-biointeractions in the blood, plasma, and serum as well as in a culture medium. The data from in vitro studies recognized the diversity in the structural organization of the living organism [67]. Moreover, few studies have reported that corona formation on nanomaterials is difficult to identify in vivo owing to the trouble in capturing them in the biological system. Given the gaps in the knowledge related to the understanding of the precise nano-biointeractions in vivo, it is no wonder that few NPs have translated from bench to bedside. The dynamic nature of fluid flow (blood) in the human body may cause some stress on NPs and act a source of adsorption of biomolecules [51][52][53]. To enrich the understanding of the impact of fluid flow dynamics on PC formation in a biological medium, investigators explored the role of shear stress on the structural integrity and surface composition of PC. They choose lipid vesicles with different surface chemistries then exposed them to FBS in static and dynamic conditions, both provided by a peristaltic pump. The PC that evolved around un-PEGylated NPs under dynamic conditions recorded a high concentration of apolipoproteins APOA-II, while under static conditions, acute phase proteins and alpha-1-antitrypsin were traced. Surprisingly, in PEGylated NPs, a total of 217 proteins were detected, of which 50% of the proteins involved in the corona were incurred under dynamic conditions and some of the coronated complement protein was identified as C3 and C4 with opsonin activity. This finding is important in relevance to the in vivo condition because a complement protein is largely associated with the clearance of NPs from systemic circulation [68,69]. Braun and colleagues investigated the influence of the dynamic flow conditions on AuNPs that were 13 nm in size with a surface coating of PEG and tannic acid. The dynamic system was designed using a peristaltic pump at a velocity of 0.5 cm/sec. It was established that the PC composition influenced the dynamic flow in synthetic fluids and the alteration in the PC relied highly on the surface designed and the chemistry of the AuNPs [51].",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa",

The observation indicated that serum components were immediately adsorbed by particle surfaces, but instead of cross-linking particles, the protein corona could stabilize the suspension of the dispersed particles. Additional electrophoresis data further verified the rapid adsorption of proteins to both PS-COOH and PS-PEG nanoparticles (Fig. 1e). PEG-coated nanoparticles, however, exhibited reduced protein adsorption, which was evident after 24-h incubation (Fig. 1f ) suggesting that PEGylation makes nanoparticles less prone to interactions with the environment.

            "text": "Once nanoparticles enter the leaves, biomolecules that bind onto the surface of nanoparticles (protein corona) will change the surface properties, translocation pathways and destination of the nanoparticles. The formation of protein corona is an important process that should not be ignored. Early research into nano-medicines considered coating nanoparticles with antifouling polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) in order to prevent the formation of protein corona. However, PEGylated nanoparticles triggered anti-PEG antibodies and resulted in accelerated blood clearance with repeated administration in vivo 45 . Research has now moved to controlling the formation of protein corona on nanoparticles to improve delivery. For example, the approved Onpattro lipid nanoparticles were designed to interact with apolipoprotein-E in the blood 46 , which are highly effective in targeting hepatocytes in the liver. Recently, machine learning was successfully used to predict the formation of protein corona to design safer nanomedicines to be used in vivo 47 . \n\nThe formation of protein corona on nano-agrochemicals may be an even more complicated process than in animals. Different types of plants have different protein contents 48 , and our current knowledge of the protein corona related to nano-agrochemicals is limited due to analytical challenges. Ideally, databases suitable for the application of machine learning can be built for nano-agrochemicals. Experiments could consider (1) the uptake of nanoparticles applied to plants, followed by ( 2) the extraction of protein corona modified nanoparticles, (3) the characterisation of the protein corona, and (4) an assessment of the influencing variables (nanoparticle type, size, shape, surface chemistry, plant species, exposure pathway, and measured plant tissues). Step 2 is extremely challenging, and as an alternative to in situ experiments, nanoparticles could also be dispersed in reconstituted plant protein solutions to monitor how protein corona form and evolve under well-controlled conditions that are particularly suitable for machine learning algorithms. An improved understanding of the formation and functions of protein corona inside the plants will help in designing nano-agrochemicals more precisely and effectively.",

            "text": "This is exacerbated by the slower elimination of IR780-oleyl from the blood stream (Fig. 1), and the stabilization towards a relatively high (> 25 ng/mL) residual concentration. Besides the marker dose applied, several factors could influence this difference between the two delivery systems, PEBCA and LipImage. Physicochemical aspects such as size, chemical composition of the nanoparticle and surface coverage of PEG are known to influence targeting; e.g. for LNPs, Dilliard et al. investigated the extrahepatic targeting, and proposed a mechanism where shedding of PEG from the particle surface is followed by selective interactions with plasma proteins, based on the chemical identity of the lipids present, and eventually tissue targeting based on the adsorbed proteins [37]. In our work, it could be noted that the length distribution of PEG moieties in the LipImage formulation is slightly shifted towards longer PEG than in the PEBCA formulation. Anselmo et al. [38] showed that for polymeric nanoparticles, material elasticity did influence circulation time and cellular uptake. Another factor that could strongly influence biodistribution of the nanoparticle payload (Cbz, IR780-oleyl) is the extent to which it exists as released, free compound, as opposed to encapsulated in the nanoparticle. Release can, in turn, happen along several routes, either by diffusion from (an intact) particle, by gradual erosion, or by complete dissociation of the particle. Release kinetics of drug molecules from therapeutic nanoparticles can vary dramatically and is influenced by PEGylation and protein corona, especially for hydrophobic drugs and a release diffusion-based release mechanism [39,40]. Thus, it becomes important to try to quantify which fraction of the payload is released, and which is still encapsulated. At the same time, quantification of the intactness of organic nanoparticles in vivo is very challenging, e.g. due to the presence of high concentrations of plasma proteins that can severely affect light scattering-based particle detection techniques.",

The molecular mechanism underlying the protein resistance of grafted with PEG are still not fully understood, 45 but a brush-induced steric repulsion preventing contact between proteins and the underlying surface, or the hydration shell surrounding PEG moieties, which suppresses adsorption of proteins, are considered as the two dominating mechanisms. 46 However, complete inhibition of corona formation remains a challenge, 47 as PEG chains on a nanoparticle's surface function as a waterbinding hydrogel-like brush, with protein-resistant properties that are highly dependent on the length, flexibility, and density of the PEG chains. 45 A recent class of nanoparticles has been fabricated by combining synthetic cores with a biologically derived membrane coating, including those derived from red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, white blood cells, cancer cells, and bacteria, has attracted attention. 48 ome of these cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles have a significant increase in their circulatory half-life, 48,49 or have the ability to better target a region of interest. 50 Each of these biomimetic nanoparticles has its own set of unique characteristics that are derived from the versatility and complexity of the cellular membrane used in their synthesis. 51,52 s a consequence, these biomimetic nanoparticles with natural surface properties are very different from synthetic nanoparticles that have a chemically modified surface, as the interface of biomimetic nanoparticles and biological systems that exist within the body is biocompatible including natural protein-protein interactions.",

            "text": "Neuronanomedicine harnesses nanoparticle technology for the treatment of neurological disorders. An unavoidable consequence of nanoparticle delivery to biological systems is the formation of a protein corona on the nanoparticle surface. Despite the well-established influence of the protein corona on nanoparticle behavior and fate, as well as FDA approval of neuro-targeted nanotherapeutics, the effect of a physiologically relevant protein corona on nanoparticle-brain cell interactions is insufficiently explored. Indeed, less than 1% of protein corona studies have investigated protein coronas formed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid surrounding the brain. Herein, we utilize two clinically relevant polymeric nanoparticles (PLGA and PLGA-PEG) to evaluate the formation of serum and CSF protein coronas. LC-MS analysis revealed distinct protein compositions, with selective enrichment/depletion profiles. Following incubation with brain cells, serum and CSF coronas on PLGA particles showed enhanced associations with all cell types as compared to their corresponding corona on PLGA-PEG particles. CSF-derived protein coronas on PLGA nanoparticles, specifically, showed the greatest nanoparticle-cell interactions, with Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis revealing that proteins associated with enhanced nanoparticle-cell interactions were exclusively enriched in this protein corona. This study demonstrates the importance of correct choice of physiologically relevant biological fluids, and its influence on the formation of the protein corona, subsequent nanoparticle-cell interactions.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle elasticity is crucial in nanoparticles\u2019 physiological fate, but how this occurs is largely unknown. Using core-shell nanoparticles with a same PEGylated lipid bilayer shell yet cores differing in elasticity (45 kPa \u2013 760 MPa) as models, we isolate the effects of nanoparticle elasticity from those of other physiochemical parameters and, using mouse models, observe a non-monotonic relationship of systemic circulation lifetime versus nanoparticle elasticity. Incubating our nanoparticles in mouse plasma provides protein coronas varying non-monotonically in composition depending on nanoparticle elasticity. Particularly, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) is the only protein whose relative abundance in corona strongly correlates with our nanoparticles\u2019 blood clearance lifetime. Notably, similar results are observed when above nanoparticles\u2019 PEGylated lipid bilayer shell is changed to be non-PEGylated. This work unveils the mechanisms by which nanoparticle elasticity affects nanoparticles\u2019 physiological fate and suggests nanoparticle elasticity as a readily tunable parameter in future rational exploiting of protein corona. Nanoparticle elasticity is known to affect physiological fate but how this occurs is largely unknown. Here, the authors report on a study using nanoparticles differing in elasticity alone to show a difference in the protein corona, in particular apolipoprotein A-1 absorption, corresponds to differences in circulation time.",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

            "text": "To further evaluate the recorded data, we analyze the kinetics of the corona formation in detail. To this end we highlight that the applied protein concentrations are low compared to native protein concentrations in blood. For this reason, the kinetics of corona formation is likely significantly accelerated in in vivo situations. We also note that, due to an increased sensitivity factor, a larger NPS peak shift is expected upon corona formation when the size of the Au core increases. Thus, the observed adsorption rates during corona formation at the surface of the differently sized nanostructures are not easily quantitatively compared. To account for the different sensitivity of the sensor structures, we have normalized the data using experimentally determined calibration factors derived from the measured peak shift induced by atomic layer deposition of 5 nm Al 2 O 3 , i.e. a thin homogenous oxide layer (see ESI \u2020 for details). In Fig. 3 we show the sensitivity-factor-normalized peak shift signal induced by corona formation plotted versus the accumulated mass of protein the sensor has been exposed to. The flow rate is the same for all experiments but the protein concentration differs between the samples (see the Experimental section in ESI \u2020 for details). For this reason, it is convenient to use the exposure (accumulated mass of protein) to compare the kinetics for the different samples. Here, we have assumed an initial protein content of 80 mg mL \u22121 in the two serum samples. Due to the applied sensitivity-factor normalization, the obtained data from the three different nanoparticle sizes are now directly and quantitatively comparable. The data show that the initial rate of the corona formation is lower for BSA compared to the two serum samples, independent of the size of the core/shell nanostructures. This implies that BSA may, despite its high concentration, not be a dominant protein in the early events of the corona formation as in competition with other serum proteins many other proteins, including IgG with a relative high concentration, will bind faster. However, the kinetics of IgG adsorption varies significantly with the size. For the smallest nanostructures, IgG exhibits a fairly low rate of adsorption, although higher than for BSA.",

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

            "text": "On this basis, for several decades protein corona was considered responsible for the triggering of the immune system and the final clearance of the nanomaterial. Actually, for most cases, protein corona formation is the very first step in the process of nanoparticle elimination [28]. Generally, coronas formed from the unspecific protein adsorption act as labels promoting nanoparticle recognition as \"non-self\" and, as a consequence, nanoparticle elimination by the immune system [29,30]. As a consequence, for a long time research has been focused on the development of antifouling coatings aimed at the complete suppression of biomolecule binding to nanomaterials. Noteworthy, antifouling coatings were believed to be the only coatings providing nanomaterials with the ability to avoid the immune system clearance. This phenomenon has been named the \"stealth\" effect and bio-inert coatings have been defined as \"stealth materials.\" Among them, the gold standard is represented by polyethylene glycol (PEG). \n\nParadoxically, \"stealth\" materials present immunological drawbacks. For example, it is well-known that the prolonged use of PEGylated materials results in the production of anti-PEG IgM antibodies [31,32] in a phenomenon known as \"accelerated blood clearance\" (ABC) [33]. Thus, with time, PEGylated nanocarriers are recognized by IgMs and accumulated in the liver [34]. Moreover, these drug delivery stealth vectors, although providing advantageous features such as long-term circulation in the blood, are in turn detrimental for cell targeting, internalization, and accumulation [35]. Complete protein corona suppression, besides being an unreachable goal, was recently questioned by the demonstration that the \"stealth effect\" requires the binding of specific plasma proteins. Thus, a nanomaterial, in order to avoid the immune system reaction, does not need to be protein repellent but protein selective. Noteworthy, such a revolutionary principle was demonstrated by studying PEG-modified nanoparticles [36].",

            "text": "The formation of a protein corona on the nanoparticle surface can be regulated by modifying the nanoparticle surface with zwitterions, polyethylene glycol (PEG), carbohydrate moieties, and dysopsonic proteins, which can enhance the colloidal stability and prolong the circulation time in blood by enabling escape from MPS clearance [14][15][16][17] . However, these strategies are still limited at conferring targeting specificity since an additional targeting ligand increases the propensity for protein corona formation to mask the targeting ability and inhibit the biological effects of nanoparticles [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . This can explain why many nanoparticles with active targeting systems have failed in clinical trials 25 . Therefore, to design nanoparticle-based therapeutic agents, there is a considerable need to regulate protein corona formation on nanoparticles [26][27][28] and to obtain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in regulating nanoparticle-biological interactions. Here, we present a targeting system in which nanoparticles are supramolecularly precoated with a protein corona shield (PCS) that reduce serum protein absorption while retaining targeting specificity (Fig. 1a).",

In these additional blood circulation assays, liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), 188kPa@lipid, and PLGA@lipid were used as the representatives for nanoparticles with extremely low ApoA1 abundance in corona, nanoparticles with appreciably high ApoA1 abundance in corona, and nanoparticles with intermediate ApoA1 abundance in corona, respectively; ApoA1 abundance in corona is observed to be ~0% for liposome, ~8% for PLGA@lipid, and ~26% for 188kPa@lipid (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a). Our addition blood circulation assays (Figure 3j) show that, for liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), pre-treating the liposome-protein complex with ApoA1 antibody failed to appreciably affect the complex's blood clearance half-life (9 h and 9.6 h with and without the ApoA1 antibody treatment, respectively) (Figure 3j), which is easy to understand considering the extremely low abundance of ApoA1 in its corona (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a).

Recently, a number of studies have been reported to characterize the role of the PEG conformation (i.e., brush or mushroom) and its impact on biomolecular corona formation. \n\nThe effect of PEG density on corona formation has been evaluated on numerous occasions. For example, NPs prepared from the particle replication in non-wetting templates (PRINT) method were prepared with two different PEG densities corresponding to the brush (0.083 PEG/nm 2 ) and mushroom (0.028 PEG/nm 2 ) regimes (Perry et al., 2012). Brush NPs displayed lower binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by nearly three-fold and four-fold less than non-PEGylated NPs. Significant differences between NPs with the two PEG conformations in terms of diminished macrophage uptake or increased circulation half-lives were not directly measured, but brush NPs performed better than mushroom NPs on average. At constant size, a similar result was obtained using AuNPs, where an increase in PEG grafting densities resulted in decreased serum protein adsorption (Walkey et al., 2011). In contrast, distinct differences were observed in terms of protein adsorption when size was considered. The same study found an inverse correlation between particle size and protein adsorption. The increased protein binding onto the smaller NPs was attributed to higher surface curvature and lower PEG-PEG steric interactions, which allowed a greater amount of the bare surface of the AuNP exposed (Figure 1B) (Walkey et al., 2011). When macrophage uptake was considered, two trends were observed. First, increased PEG density on similarly sized NPs resulted in decreased uptake. Second, at similar PEG densities, smaller NPs were taken up to a lesser extent than larger ones.",

(2020) studied a set of polymeric nanomaterials with varying circulation times in mice and used proteomics protocols to probe the protein corona. This in vivo \"fingerprinting\" study showed that the protein corona changed dynamically over time. Hence, coagulation and complement proteins were decreased and immunoglobulins, acute phase reactants, and lipoproteins were increased in abundance over time. The authors found that nanoparticles that circulated longer were apparently able to shed some of the initial surface bound common opsonins, and they speculated that this continuous remodeling of surface bound proteins may be an important step in dictating the in vivo fate of soft nanomaterials in mice. \n\nPEGylation remains a common strategy for the preparation of long-circulating nanoparticles, although, as we have seen, this surface modification does not prevent protein binding altogether. Hacene et al. (2021) developed an ingenious immunoprecipitation method using anti-PEG antibodies cross-linked to magnetic beads to extract different PEGylated particles including polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. Using Balb/c mice, the authors injected PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles intravenously, and blood was collected 15 min after dosing. After separation of red blood cells, the nanoparticles were quantitatively recovered from plasma (thus suggesting that the epitope recognized by the anti-PEG antibody remains available on the surface of the nanoparticles even in the presence of a protein corona). The authors determined the composition of the surface adsorbed proteins and found that apolipoproteins were enriched on the surface of the nanoparticles (Hacene et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects.

The peak effects seem to occur after 1 or more hours of incubation with agents. However, it is known that galectins accumulate around a vesicle within seconds after disruption, e.g. ref 22. Endocytosis itself occurs within minutes, and the endocytic pathway from cell surface to lysosome takes no more than 20 minutes. So, what is it that takes the extra time?\n\nWe agree with the perceptive observations of the reviewer that in theory endocytosis and lysosomal delivery occurs quickly along with rapid Galectin recruitment in the case of endosomal escape, however in the case of lipid nanoparticles there are additional factors that delay and prevent immediate particle uptake and the subsequent GAL9 response. Notably, ionisable LNP uptake by cells is assisted by the formation of a protein corona that can act as a natural ligand to aid in receptormediated uptake of LNPs, such as ApoE adsorption onto MC3 particles 5 . Furthermore, PEG-Lipids act to 'shield' particles in circulation and cell culture media. Removal of PEG (PEG shedding) or occlusion of the PEG molecules (possibly through development of a protein corona) is therefore required before efficient cellular uptake of LNPs is observed and accounts for the delayed uptake.\n\nWe have noted this point in the manuscript (Lines 178-181):\n\n\"We observed a delayed onset and peak of Cy5 and GAL9 puncta formation between 4h-10h in cell lines following LNP addition and this likely represents the time required for PEG-Shedding and/or protein corona formation in the cell culture media. These changes are prerequisites for efficient particle uptake.\"\n\nIt is however possible to observe with polymer nanoparticles (Fig. 4e) that after a single PNP is internalised at 0.5h, it becomes GAL9 positive at a timepoint between 0",

It has been recently demonstrated that plasma protein adsorption of PEG(+) MNPs, but not bare MNPs, triggers complement activation, 56 which may consequently alter protein corona composition, physical characteristics and particle behaviors in circulation. For larger MNPs, PEGylation may reduce particle-particle interaction induced by magnetic moment generation in magnetic field, and thus enhance MNP escape, allowing dynamic retention of MNPs in vivo. The results herein suggest that PEG(+) MNPs circulation can be magnetically captured. Moreover, the weakening vascular wall-nanoparticle interaction by PEGylation may facilitate blood residence, 27,32 favoring the therapeutic outcome with the target in the circulating blood. Nevertheless, the characteristics of PEGylated nanoparticles may also depend on the composition of the PEG moiety. 45 The molecular weight, 57,58 density 59 and conformation 39,60,61 of PEG may affect nanoparticle-cell interaction, 32,39 the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles, 32,59 and thus their behaviors in circulation. Further studies of the composition of the PEG(+) MNPs coating materials should be undertaken.",

Firstly scientific developments now suggest that biological recognition of nanoscale surfaces entails levels of complexity and subtlety not previously recognised. For example, the identity of the protein corona may influence drug release profiles. 19 Blood circulation times may require the recognition of specific proteins or protein motifs on the particle surface. 20 onversely other proteins may lead to a lower probability of recognition and longer nanoparticle (NP) circulation times in vivo. 5 The complexity is well described in the work of Cai  et al., where the authors suggest that \"appropriate surface ligands with reduced protein binding and desired long blood circulation time could be predicted from acquired corona composition\". 21 29][30][31][32] In particular, questions about how interactions with environmental molecules are influenced by the ligand coverage (surface density) and conformation have been raised. \n\nThe original paradigm of nanoscale biomolecular recognition that was framed around the 'biomolecular corona' 24 may be briefly summarised as follows. Those environmentally derived biomolecules presented 'accessibly' 22,23 on the nanoparticle surface with residence times exceeding a critical 'processing time' are deemed to be involved in biological recognition and processing and termed 'hard corona', whereas those that exchange faster are termed 'soft corona' and while they affect physicochemical aspects of the material they are unlikely to contribute directly to recognition.",

In addition, TEM was used to visually confirm the nanocarrier size and morphology (Figure S8). There were no visual differences between the pristine and PEGylated nanocarriers detected. All formulations appeared to form small cluster duplets with a diameter of about 200 nm. In summary, the experiments conducted during this study exhibited a reduced but not fully diminished protein corona formation following PEGylation of mgHES nanocarriers, which in turn did not have an influence on the PEG-induced stealth properties. \n\nIn addition to avoiding non-specific clearance of nanocarriers by phagocytes, conjugating active targeting moieties onto nanocarriers is the main prerequisite for a precise Apart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1).",

Nevertheless, when nanoparticles enter in contact with physiological fluids, the biocorona transforms their surface in their biological identity, meaning that their surface is modified due to the attachment of proteins and other macromolecules from blood and other biological fluids, thus hiding important surface functionalities and hampering their expected biodistribution [12,63]. Moreover, the adsorption of opsonins or other specific proteins might lead to fast clearance from the body. pBAE nanoparticles, as most nanocarriers, include hydrophilic polymers to overcome this common bottleneck step. Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is the most extensively used polymer in drug delivery to allow the vectors to circumnavigate biological barriers, decrease the unspecific absorption in non-targeted tissue, and increase the specific cellular uptake [12]. However, PEG can be recognized by the immune system and causes strong allergic reactions in some patients [39,40]. Consequently, extensive work on controlling the formation of the biocorona by tuning the nanoparticle's surface exists in the bibliography. In our first attempts, we worked on tuning nanoparticle surfaces to promote the binding of proteins of interest from the corona. We published this study in 20196, selecting liver targeting as a proof-ofconcept. Being aware that hepatocytes have receptors for the retinol-binding protein (RBD), a protein present in the human serum, we designed a retinol-modified place intending to promote the formation of a corona enriched with RBP. This work demonstrated that we could tune the biodistribution by playing with the protein corona while achieving the envisaged organ targeting. Nevertheless, this strategy is limited to targeting cells with specific affinity proteins in the serum.",

In the absence of biomolecules, on the other hand, the high surface energy of the original nanoparticle surface remains when in contact with cells. Thus, components from the cell membrane instead adsorbs to the nanoparticle -effectively forming a cell-derived corona 80 -and only then is the high surface energy lowered. In essence, it is imperative to expose nanoparticles with corona to blood-brain barrier models, because otherwise effects that will never be seen in vivo may be observed. Corona formation can be ensured simply by using medium supplemented with serum (or, better yet, plasma) in the nanoparticle studies. This may not be the correct corona, because the exposure route will determine which biomolecules can be found in the corona, and ultimately those biomolecules will determine how the nanoparticle is processed by the blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, while the detailed biomolecules will determine the specifics, it would appear that a far bigger effect results from having biomolecules there at all.",

This group studied positively and negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles (nPsNPs and pPsNPS, respectively) and silica nanoparticles of various sizes (\u00d8 \u2248 35, 120, and 140 nm), loads, and surface modifications (unmodified amine and carboxylate), exposing them to human plasma for different periods of time. They quantified the formation of 166 different protein coronas every 30 s for PsNPs and silica nanoparticles (35 nm). When modified the surfaces were able to quantify the formation of 300 different protein coronas. \n\nSome authors have pointed out that the protein corona can increase the useful drug load capacity of nanoparticles. The very small size of the nanoparticles facilitates their travel down the bloodstream, their incorporation into cells, and their interaction with the cellular compartments with different molecules, including DNA. A way in which the protein corona can improve not only nanoparticles' drug transporting capacities but also their pharmacokinetic properties is by increasing payload capability through the use of porous materials (e.g., porous silicon) that can be packaged with the drug, as well as through the volume increase of liposomes. However, most current methods, unaware of the formation of the protein corona, typically load the drugs over the nanoparticles surface via chemical conjugation or adsorption. In these cases, the maximum amount that can be charged is restricted to a single layer [90]. Nanoparticles functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been recently \n\ndeveloped. PEG provides colloidal stability even under conditions of physiological salinity caused by interparticle repulsion. However, even complex pegylation is unable to completely prevent the formation of the protein corona, even though the degree of protein adsorption is clearly reduced [91]. \n\nThe adsorption of serum proteins and the formation of a corona are part of the immune response.",

            "text": "that the three nanoparticles investigated in this study circulate very well in vivo in mice. Prolonged circulation times are of major importance, since they enhance the chance for passive or active targeting and thus for accumulation in the tumor tissue. This could be verified for similar or identical structures of the tested nanoparticles (see section \"Tumor accumulation of studied nanoparticles\" in the Supporting Information). In addition and more important, the PEG NPs (CPC634) show excellent pharmacokinetics in patients. [52] Hereafter, we considered a comparative study of the interaction of the three nanoparticles with plasma proteins important to gain a better understanding of the role of protein affinity and protein corona formation on the circulation times.\n\nTo determine interactions with plasma proteins, the three nanoparticles were incubated in EDTA-stabilized, full human plasma (pooled from six healthy donors) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and continuously agitated (500 rpm) to simulate the conditions in the body, where diffusion of cells and proteins constantly occur in the blood flow. As previously shown, one hour of incubation is sufficient for protein corona formation. [53,54] Since the separation of nanoparticles and plasma components by centrifugation is hardly possible for systems with densities comparable to plasma, such as polymeric micelles, we have chosen to apply asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation for the separation of nanoparticles and plasma components. Here, we specifically optimized AF4 separation conditions for each nanoparticle allowing the exclusive elution of the incubated nanoparticles and their separation from the plasma proteins. The isolated nanoparticle-protein-complex was then measured by dynamic light scattering to characterize any size increase due to protein adsorption. Moreover, protein affinity was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and label-free liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A schematic illustration of the separation procedure is displayed in Figure 2.\n\nSince most single proteins in blood plasma are in the size range of 6-10 nm, [55] thus smaller than the investigated nanopar",

            "text": "It is nowadays accepted that IONPs adsorb a plethora of ions and biological molecules (i.e., lipids, sugars, proteins) when they come into contact with biological fluids such as blood [94]. This biomolecular corona ultimately affects the interaction of non-functionalized IONPs with biological systems, a property known as \"biological identity\". The biomolecular corona must be taken into account when considering the intrinsic biological effects that IONPs can produce. Indeed, Escamilla-Rivera et al. found that PEG-coated IONPs absorb a wide variety of complement recognition proteins when incubated with human serum, leading to complement activation when injected in mice [95]. Similarly, Zhu et al. demonstrated that the addition of IONPs to the hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold enhances osteogenesis in vivo, most likely mediated by a dynamic formation of a protein corona enriched in complement-, wound healing-, and inflammatory-related factors [96]. These reports thus suggest that the protein corona can endow IONPs with immunomodulating features. However, the biomolecule corona largely depends on the surface coating of the metallic core of IONPs as demonstrated by Vogt et al. These authors found that silica-coated and dextran-coated IONPs adsorb a distinctive subset of serum proteins, which leads to a differential effect on primary human macrophages [97]. Furthermore, the inherent dynamic nature of the protein corona, more specifically the so-called soft corona that exhibits a high exchange rate, can affect the biological identity of IONPs. Ashby et al. reported that a highly hydrophobic surface coating promoted the deposition of human serum proteins having larger hydrophobic domains and a much faster exchange rate, and thus a more dynamic protein corona. A similar correlation was found between larger core diameters and protein corona dynamics [98]. Nanoparticle size also seems to correlate inversely with the protein corona, not only in terms of composition but also in protein amount, due to a curvature effect [99]. Nonetheless, Ashby et al. evidenced for the first time that a soft corona is much less influential in IONP endocytosis than a hard corona [98].",

            "text": "The stability of the PEG-tailored zein nanoparticles was explored in bovine serum solution to assess their suitability for biological investigations. Serum proteins can adsorb to the surface of nanoparticles and affect their cellular uptake pattern or even cause nanoparticle aggregation [52]. Moreover, different coating and targeting strategies may affect protein corona development over the surface of targeted nanoparticles, which can vary with different serum sources and hence translate into the behavior of targeted nanoparticles in the biological environment [53]. Figure 4 illustrates alterations in sizes, PDI, and zeta potential of the Z-PEG and Z-PEG-GA nanoparticles at different time intervals. The nanoparticle sizes did not show any appreciable change at the first 24 h compared to the size of the reference nanoparticle, as shown in Figure 4A. However, after 48 h, a meaningful escalation in size was observed. Similarly, the PDI values showed the same change pattern as elucidated in Figure 4B, with an obvious monodispersity at the first 24 h. In addition, the zeta potential of the PEGylated zein formulations remained unchanged at the first 12 h, as depicted in Figure 4C. However, a significant reduction in zeta potential was prominent in the next 24 and 48 h. \n\nIt is noteworthy that PEGylated platforms are less liable for aggregation when incubated with animal serum; meanwhile, a lower degree of PEGylation might induce aggregation of particles in physiological fluids [54]. Furthermore, serum proteins might adsorb to the surface of particles at physiological pH as a function of incubation time, generating an accumulation of protein corona over the nanoparticle's surface, which induces increased size and PDI values and reduced nanoparticles' surface potential [55]. Although PEGylated zein nanoparticles have proven their reliable stability 24 h after incubation with serum, the development of the protein corona over PEGylated zein platforms was found to have negligible influence on cellular uptake to cancer cells [56].",

Many studies were focused on their covalent functionalization with biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), to overcome MWCNTs limitations due to their toxicity and their tendency to aggregate in biological fluids (Tan et al. 2020;Yumita et al. 2020;Solhjoo et al. 2021). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the coating of DAAO with PEG enhances the enzyme stability, favoring the production of hydrogen peroxide over time (Rosini and Pollegioni 2020;Nakamura et al. 2021). \n\nAnother important aspect, to evaluate after administration of a nanocarrier into the human body bloodstream, is the interaction between the nanosystem and biological fluids components, essential to the formation of the 'protein corona' (PC), also called 'bio-corona', around nanoparticles. The formation of PC is a dynamic process, that involves many weak forces between physiological proteins and nanoparticles' surface (Fasoli 2021;Kopac 2021;Li et al. 2021). Protein corona composition and thickness are influenced by both nanoparticles features (such as dimension, morphology and surface properties) and environmental features (like biological fluid composition, pH and temperature). The bio-corona is able to affect nanoparticles properties, influencing their biodistribution and their targeting capacity (Nicoletti et al. 2018;Huang et al. 2021;Tengjisi et al. 2022). PC could be divided into two main layers: 'soft corona' (SC) and 'hard corona' (HC). Proteins belonging to HC directly bind nanoparticles surface with high affinity, generating a stable and nonexchangeable layer. HC is responsible of nanoparticle fate by controlling membrane adhesion, cellular signaling pathways, biodistribution and interactions with surrounding cells.",

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

In stark contrast, for 188kPa@lipid nanoparticle, pre-treating the nanoparticle-protein complex with ApoA1 antibody significantly reduced the complex's blood clearance half-life (Figure 3j), with the calculated average blood clearance half-life being shortened from 44 h to 36 h (relatively by ~18%) due to the shielding of adsorbed ApoA1 by ApoA1 antibody. For PLGA@lipid, the pre-treatment with ApoA1 antibody reduced the complex's blood clearance half-life (with the calculated average blood clearance halflife being shortened from 39 h to 35 h) (relatively by ~10%) (Figure 3j). Interestingly, for these three model nanoparticles, their order of relative change in blood clearance (0% for liposome, 10% for PLGA@lipid, and ~18% for 188kPa@lipid) nicely mirrors their ranks of ApoA1 abundance in corona (~0% for liposome, ~8% for PLGA@lipid, and ~26% for 188kPa@lipid) (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a). Clearly, shielding/screening adsorbed ApoA1 in corona over a nanoparticle shortens the particle's blood circulation lifetime and the relative extent of such shortening is related with the particle's relative abundance of ApoA1 in corona. Combined with our calculations on the correlation coefficient between relative protein abundance in corona versus nanoparticle blood circulation lifetime (Figure 3h), these additional blood circulation assays demonstrate that ApoA1 abundance in corona is correlated significantly and positively with nanoparticle circulation lifetime in blood. In revision, we also calculated the correlation coefficient (i.e., Pearson's r in this work) between the relative abundance of physiologically functional proteins in corona and our nanoparticles' blood clearance half-lives ( Figure R2 below) as the reviewer suggested and found that only immunoglobulins and coagulation proteins consistently exhibited a calculated Pearson's r of <-0.6 in both trials, indicative of strong negative correlation. Notably, no protein family consistently exhibited a",

The methodology allows for tracking corona dynamics in situ under physiological conditions. Results evidence that the two extracellular vesicle populations feature distinct corona dynamics.

            "text": "Another critical effect affecting biodistribution is protein corona, which coats particles with serum proteins [55]. Because of the nanoparticle coating, slight alterations in surface charges are expected, leading to further interactions between serum proteins in a cascade fashion and thus preventing the interaction between nanomedicines and their tumor targets [56]. However, it is essential to emphasize that the protein corona effect involves two classes of components affecting nanomedicines' biodistribution: opsonins and dysopsonins [57]. Opsonins, such as proteins of the complement system (C3b and C1q) and immunoglobulins, are the most common, and their adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles is responsible for their engulfment and clearance by the RES-associated phagocytic cells, more specifically in the liver and spleen [58][59][60][61][62][63]. Engrafting hydrophilic or amphiphilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), on the surface of the particles, is one strategy for reducing RES recognition [60,64,65]. Despite the popularity of this technique, issues related to PEG molecules' stability and immunogenicity have emerged in the last few years [66,67]. Recently, zwitterionic materials, such as sulfobetaine, have been used to confer stealth properties. Their mixed charges and electrostatic repulsion account for dense packing, thus impairing protein corona formation [68][69][70][71]. In contrast, dysopsonins, such as clusterin (apolipoprotein J) and albumin, have the opposite effect, prolonging nanomedicine's half-life in circulation [64,72]. For example, the glycoprotein CD47, which is expressed in all cellular membranes of humans, mice, and other mammals [73], interacts with CD172a on phagocytes [74] and inhibits macrophage uptake of antibody-coated mouse red blood cells (RBCs) [75].",

            "text": "Coating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach. Increased circulation times and brain accumulation are reported for PEG-coated NPs prepared from polycyanoacrylate [173][174][175], poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) [176,177], polystyrene [176], and other polymers [178], which is associated with the decreased formation of protein corona and evasion of the MPS. PEG density regulates corona formation and, consequently, particle clearance, of which the threshold for rapid clearance is indicated as 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 for PLGA-PG nanoparticles, largely independent of particle size (diameters of 55, 90, and 140 nm) [177]. No distinguishable difference regarding the composition of the protein corona was observed, although Apo E amounts decrease with increasing PEG density. Moreover, 100 nm diameter polystyrene NPs coated with nine PEG chains per 100 nm 2 showed good diffusion in rat brain tissue ex vivo, as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, as compared with particles with lower densities. Even below the PEG density threshold reported by Bertrand et al., brain diffusion appears to benefit from increased PEG density, which may be attributed to the higher quantity of Apo E in the protein corona and reduced adhesiveness [176,177]. Other surface modification methods to control protein corona formation are surface charge and hydrophobicity modulation [179][180][181]. \n\nParticles' mechanical properties also result in different protein corona profiles, which may affect uptake, toxicity, transport across the BBB, and brain accumulation [44,48,182,183]. Protein adsorption is lower for softer particles, which ultimately leads to a reduced impact of corona-related particle-cell interactions [183,184]. \n\nTargeting capabilities of ligand-decorated NPs are likewise also affected by the presence of a protein corona [75]. Corona formation and the effects on targeting have been evaluated for PEGylated polystyrene NPs functionalized with Tf [74].",

            "text": "It can be divided into two categories: a \"hard\" corona, and a \"soft\" corona. The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense [17], based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds [11], which is known as the Vroman effect [18]. The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it [19,20], the time of exposure [11,17,21], and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic [17,21]. Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally [21], unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona [22]. The great majority of the proteins that form the corona are independent of the size and surface charge of the nanoparticle but are very influenced by the chemical properties of the material that constitutes the nanoparticle [23]. However, there are still sensitive proteins to size and surface charge, whose nature can change and consequently alter the interactions between nanoparticles and cells with the consequent alteration of the biological outcome and biological impacts [23]. For instance, if opsonins bind to the nanoparticle in the protein corona, they will be recognized as a \"threat,\" and consequently are phagocytosed by macrophages [24]. It is crucial to prevent opsonization, \"camouflage\" the nanoparticle to avoid the phagocytosis, and keep the nanoparticles in circulation, which can be achieved by the application of a polymer coating, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [25].",

            "text": "Nanomaterials promptly adsorb biomolecules leading to the formation of a so-called bio-corona 23 . The binding of proteins or other biomolecules to nanoparticle surfaces may thereby afford a new \"identity\" to the nanoparticle 24 . Deng et al. 25 showed that poly(acrylic acid)-coated gold nanoparticles bind fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clot formation, in a charge-dependent manner, inducing unfolding of the protein, and that binding to integrin receptors on the surface of the monocytic cell line, THP-1 leads to activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. In a comprehensive study using a panel of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes and surface modifications, Tenzer et al. 26 could show that plasma protein adsorption occurs very rapidly, and that it affects hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, cellular uptake, and endothelial cell death. Vlasova et al. 27 reported that adsorbed plasma proteins influenced neutrophil responses caused by polymer-coated, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Specifically, the adsorption of IgG resulted in neutrophil activation, as determined by degranulation and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Similarly, protein adsorption modulated neutrophil responses toward carboxylated, non-PEGylated SWCNTs 28 . Lara et al. 29 employed an immuno-mapping technique to study epitope presentation of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immunoglobulin G. The authors could show that both proteins displayed functional motifs allowing for recognition of the bio-corona on silica nanoparticles by LDL receptor and Fc-\u03b3 receptor I, respectively. On the other hand, others have pointed out that the bio-corona could shield targeting ligands on nanoparticles 30 . However, recent studies suggested clever ways in which to circumvent this problem 31,32 .",

            "text": "The applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the nature of the proteins composing the protein corona varies on the basis of the steric properties of the nanoparticle surface, with a consequent different impact on the circulation time. Indeed, despite proteins of the complement cascade not seeming to be involved in modifying the clearance of nanoparticles as shown by wild type and complement protein 3 (C3) knockout mice, different results were obtained with apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The latter belongs to a class of proteins hardly adherent to the nanoparticle surface. A low PEG density was associated with a high deposition of ApoE in vivo, with a consequent reduced clearance. An opposite effect was noticed in high PEG-covered nanoparticles or in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 animals with a resultant higher nanoparticle opsonization and elimination. The LDL receptor (LDLR) also showed to interfere with nanoparticles distribution and elimination rate independently from the PEG density. In fact, LDLR \u2212/\u2212 knockout mice or pretreatment of the experimental animals with a strong LDLR binder such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) increased the nanoparticle circulation time when compared to the control. \n\nRecently, the formation of a personalized protein corona started to be considered not only as an obstacle for proper nanoparticles targeting but also as an emerging tool for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic personalized nanomedicine. In this context, Ren and co-workers reported a proteomic study in which polyanionic gadolinium metallofullerenol (Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 ) nanoparticles were used for the analysis of the composition of the protein corona in 10 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma [101]. Interestingly, results led to the identification of C1q, a protein of the complement system, as the most bound biomarker to the surface of Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 nanoparticles. Binding of C1q Gd@C 82 (OH) 22 nanoconstructs led to the disruption of the secondary structure of the protein, nanoparticle endosomal internalization, and enhanced activation of the immune system.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

            "text": "Perhaps most importantly though, nanoparticles bound by hydrophobic proteins display \"danger\" signals (i.e., PAMPs and DAMPs), which cause them to be more quickly cleared by the immune system [101][102][103]. Alternatively, hydrophilic particles, which decrease plasma protein absorption [51,100], appear to drastically lower the level of complement activation [52,104]. Regardless, alterations in the binding pattern and conformation of different proteins in the corona [51,52], as directed by the intrinsic properties of the underlying nanoparticle surface, can modify nanoparticle circulation time and biodistribution, ultimately, either mitigating or enhancing the function of the particle [51]. In an impactful 2014 study on the nano-bio interface, Behzadi et al. examined the effect of the protein corona on drug release from both synthesized and commercial particles, finding that the protein corona surrounding Abraxane, an FDA approved albumin-bound form of paclitaxel, effectively suppressed the burst release of drug. While the protein corona surrounding Abraxane suppresses the burst release of paclitaxel, the protein corona surrounding Doxova compromises the integrity of the particle, potentially leading to increased circulation times, but consequently compromising cellular penetration and promoting premature release of its doxorubicin payload [105]. PEGylation increases the circulation time of the nanoparticle, as well as its affinity to immune-competent proteins, [51,106,107]. This effect is directed by both the surface density and molecular weigh of PEG [51,108]. Alternatively, coating with pluronic F127 has also been demonstrated to decrease serum protein adsorption, while increasing dispersion [109]. Finally, more neutral or zwitterionic particles and those above 50 nm lead to a decreased protein corona, resulting in a reduced chance of removal from the bloodstream [110,111].",

The formed adlayer is commonly referred to as biomolecule corona (biocorona) and defines the biological activity and toxicity of the nanoparticle. Therefore, it is essential to understand in detail the biocorona formation process, and how it is governed by parameters like composition of the biological environment, and nanoparticle size, shape and faceting. Here we present a detailed equilibrium and real time in situ study of biocorona formation at SiO2-nanoparticle surfaces upon exposure to defined (BSA, IgG) and complex (bovine serum, IgG depleted bovine serum) biological samples. We use both nanofabricated surface-associated Au core-SiO2 shell nanoparticles (faceted, d = 92-167 nm) with integrated nanoplasmonic sensing function and dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles (using DLS and SDS-PAGE). The results show that preadsorbed BSA or IgG are exchanged for other proteins when exposed to bovine serum. In addition, the results show that IgG forms a biocorona with different properties at curved (edge) and flat (facet) SiO2-nanoparticle surfaces. Our study paves the way for further real time in situ investigations of the biocorona formation and evolution kinetics, as well as the role of molecular orientation in biocorona formation, on nanoparticles with surface faceting.",

            "text": "In summary, this study revealed a previously unknown effect of intracellular exchange of protein corona components on CMA activation as a result of proteostasis disruption. The enhanced CMA activity arising from shedding of blood proteins intracellularly was further identified by determining the cellular metabolism at both cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 6). In brief, as nanoparticles migrated from the bloodstream into cells, the nanoparticles would disassociate part of their acquired blood proteins, which were replaced by cellular proteins due to their higher affinity for the nanoparticles' surface. This intracellular transformation of the protein corona further modulated nanoparticle-induced biological processes, including proteostasis and metabolic stress responses, especially glycolysis and lipid metabolism. This alteration of cell metabolism was caused by the interplay of coronal proteins with other molecules in the cellular environments. PKM2, a key molecule for cellular metabolism, was incorporated into the nanoparticles corona and subsequently dominated their biological identity. \n\nFor NMs used as nanomedicines or nanocarriers, a better understanding of the \"biological identity\" of their intracellular protein corona is crucial to ensure their biological benefits while minimizing their potential hazards. Biologically, proteostasis is central to cell function, and its disruption, as revealed by the current study, entails profound implications for mediating human disorders ranging from cancers to aging. Furthermore, the protein corona-induced CMA can influence cellular clearance of nanoparticles and alter cellular metabolism, which may impact the efficiency and bioavailability of nanoscale delivery systems. CMA could be a useful target for directing and manipulating the cellular and subcellular fate of nanoparticles. Such understanding of the intracellular protein corona, together with our existing knowledge of the physical and biochemical transformations of NMs in tissues and organs (11,57,58), highlights the complexity of the nano-bio interface and provides a crucial new molecular insight for guiding the safe design of future nanomedicines.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, Ashby et al. evidenced for the first time that a soft corona is much less influential in IONP endocytosis than a hard corona [98]. This was demonstrated by pre-incubating amphiphilic block copolymer (AMP)-coated IONPs of 10 and 25 nm with transferrin and assessing their endocytosis in a macrophage model. Even when non-functionalized IONPs showed a similar internalization rate, 10-nm AMP-coated IONPs underwent increased endocytosis by macrophages when pre-incubated with transferrin as compared to 25-nm AMP-coated IONPs, suggesting that the presence of a hard corona is a prominent factor in receptor-mediated endocytosis. \n\nSynthetic identity has a clear influence on biological identity, i.e., how the composition of the adsorbed protein corona is determined by the nature of the surface coating (Figure 1 and Table 2). \n\nStepien et al. proved that two different surface coatings, i.e., glucose and polyethylene glycol (PEG), promote the formation of protein corona with a distinct composition. These synthetic differences also impacted the IONP degradation rate in vitro, as glucose-coated IONP degradation appeared to be accelerated. However, in vivo assessment of biodegradation showed contrasting results, with PEG-coated IONPs exhibiting faster biodegradation and clearance [100]. The influence of synthetic identity on the composition of a protein corona and the biodegradation rate also leads to another important question, i.e., how these complex interactions determine nanoparticle toxicity. Ma et al. revealed that the nature of a corona protein determines the biodegradation rate and, consequently, cell toxicity; the authors did this by comparing nanoparticles with three different coronae: human serum albumin (HSA), \u03b3-globulin, and serum fibrinogen. In their experiments, nanoparticles with HSA-composed corona degraded faster, and as a result, cell viability decreased concomitantly with a reduction in ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential [101].",

            "text": "Using super-resolution optical microscopy (STORM), Feiner-Gracia et al. (2017) were able to visualize the protein corona formed on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity and found a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption within the same nanoparticle population. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that changes in the corona composition occurred over time due to the chemistry and degradability of the particles, thus adding a further level of complexity to our understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials (Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017). \n\nThe second, non-technical (and non-trivial) question refers to the biological \"meaning,\" if any, of all these proteins. It is well understood that the presence or absence of proteins, regardless of their identity, may influence the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles. The question is whether there is a role for specific proteins in the bio-corona? Tenzer et al. (2013) performed comprehensive studies using a panel of PS nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles of various sizes displaying different surface charges and could show that the rapid formation of a plasma protein corona could modulate distinct pathophysiological effects as evidenced by the ex vivo analysis of platelet activation/aggregation and red blood cell lysis (i.e., hemolysis). However, the complexity of the protein corona precluded the assignment of specific proteins to account for these effects (and perhaps the effects were related to a shielding of the particle surface, thereby passivating the nanoparticles) (see, e.g., Hu et al., 2011, Lesniak et al., 2012). Indeed, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles is mitigated in the presence of serum whereas ZnO nanoparticles that undergo rapid dissolution are cytotoxic both in the absence and presence of serum (Shi et al., 2012).",

            "text": "When a pristine nanoparticle (NP) encounters a biological fluid, biomolecules spontaneously form adsorption layers around the NP, called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. The corona composition depends on the time-dependent environmental conditions and determines the NP\u2019s fate within living organisms. Understanding how the corona evolves is fundamental in nanotoxicology as well as medical applications. However, the process of corona formation is challenging due to the large number of molecules involved and to the large span of relevant time scales ranging from 100 \u03bcs, hard to probe in experiments, to hours, out of reach of all-atoms simulations. Here we combine experiments, simulations, and theory to study (i) the corona kinetics (over 10\u20133\u2013103 s) and (ii) its final composition for silica NPs in a model plasma made of three blood proteins (human serum albumin, transferrin, and fibrinogen). When computer simulations are calibrated by experimental protein\u2013NP binding affinities measured in single-protein solutions, the theoretical model correctly reproduces competitive protein replacement as proven by independent experiments. When we change the order of administration of the three proteins, we observe a memory effect in the final corona composition that we can explain within our model. Our combined experimental and computational approach is a step toward the development of systematic prediction and control of protein\u2013NP corona composition based on a hierarchy of equilibrium protein binding constants.",

The smaller surface free energy of particles <10 nm is more and more balanced by shear forces due to Brownian motion with the consequence of detachment of proteins. The authors explained their finding with a heteroaggregation model in which a low number of SPIOs is stabilized between layers of proteins. In our FPLC study we do not see such large protein-SPIO-aggregates with our larger particle. In striking contrast to our findings, Jansch et al. incubated smaller USPIOs with plasma proteins and found no albumin in the corona and excluded a \"Vroman effect\" in their setting [37]. It therefore looks like that the protein corona formation of a given nanoparticle is not simply predictable and depends on the individual properties of the respective particles. \n\nIn our pilot study in vivo, we could measure an almost quantitative uptake of the preformed adsorbed transferrin corona into the liver and spleen presumably by professional phagocytes such as Kupffer cells in the liver. We found earlier by electron microscopy of murine liver tissues after i.v. injection of the polymer coated SPIO that these monodisperse iron cores are present in endosomal structures of Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [38]. These negative charged SPIOs had no preformed transferrin corona but must have been also coated by plasma proteins before liver uptake took place implicating a similar biodistribution. This confirms the stability of a corona in a recent study by Wang et al. using a cell culture model [22].",

In contrast with different reports, where PEGylation reduced protein adsorption to the surface of nanoparticles, we identified a major number of proteins (136) in NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) versus NP-DMSA with 121 proteins. Furthermore, we observed a relatively high homology between the composition of the soft and hard corona of the NPs. Approximately 70%, for NP-DMSA, and 65%, for NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) , of the proteins detected in the soft corona were also detected in the hard corona of the nanoparticles. The PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. Having said that, a slight enrichment in the content of albumin in the surface of NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) could be related with the results obtained in the in vitro experiments in RAW 264.7 and Caco-2 cells. The viability of both cell lines is preserved in all cases when treated with the nanoparticles up to an iron concentration of 1 mM. Above that concentration, PEGylated nanoparticles caused less toxicity on Caco-2 cells which were also more sensitive than RAW 264.7 macrophages. The NP-DMSA were absorbed more (4.5 fold increase) in comparison with NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) (2.7 fold increase), suggesting that the differences observed in the uptake of the nanoparticles were related with the chemical characteristics of the coating and also with the biomolecular interface formed around the NPs with the proteins of the serum. Moreover, it was demonstrated that these two parameters were of great influence in the in vivo behaviour of these nanoparticles.\n\nThe results presented in this work indicate that the composition of the protein corona is very difficult to predict.

            "text": "The fate of a nanoparticle, i.e., the biological area that it will target, is known to be dependent upon the nature of the particle itself, i.e., its hydrophobicity, size, radius of curvature, charge, coatings, etc. These factors influence the protein coating that is formed around nanoparticles when it enters a biological fluid. This coated-protein structure of nanoparticles is called a protein corona. The coated protein may undergo conformational change, leading to the exposure of new epitopes and altered function. Protein corona interacts with certain biological membranes while showing no interaction with certain other biological membranes. It shows specificity, thus determining the fate of nanoparticles. Protein binding to nanoparticles also helps to increase the dissolution rate of nanoparticles [47,48]. As depicted in Figure 1, a protein corona forms once nanoparticles are injected inside the body, where it interacts with serum biomolecules, especially protein. Highaffinity proteins bind tightly with the nanoparticle surface, forming a first layer of hard corona followed by the reversible adsorption of low-affinity protein, forming an additional layer of soft corona [49]. The nature of nanoparticles, such as size, charge, hydrophobicity, etc., contributes to the formation of the corona. Various interactions take place between the corona and the surrounding environment and the corona dynamically changes. These interactions include steric hindrance, protein binding capability, available surface area, binding interaction and characteristic protein attachment/detachment. Steric hindrance prevents binding of the corona to other particles. The available surface area, surface coverage and angle of curvature determine the adsorption profile of nanoparticles. Binding interaction releases surface-free energy, leading to surface reconstruction of the corona. Competitive binding interaction depends upon protein composition and body fluid composition. Characteristic protein attachment/detachment depends upon the material type and protein characteristic. All these interactions help to change the corona dynamically. The corona changes when particles translocate from one biological compartment to another. In the process of formation of the protein corona, when the protein interacts with nanoparticles, they undergo potential changes in their structure and function. Basically, protein conformational change takes place, leading",

With nanoparticle reporters, the amount of nonspecific binding is generally higher with biological sample matrices, such as plasma and serum, compared to artificial buffers [7,8]. This matrix effect can often be decreased by diluting the sample, but the performance of the assay is not necessarily increased as also the analyte concentration decreases with dilution.\n\nThe surface chemistry has been concluded to have a considerable effect on the nonspecific interactions of the nanoparticle reporters in biological fluids [9][10][11][12]. Nanoparticles have been shown to adsorb proteins from the surrounding solution forming a protein corona on the particle surface, which affects their interactions especially in one-step assays, in which the nanoparticle conjugates are incubated together with the sample. The surface chemistry of nanoparticles has a considerable effect on the formation and composition of protein corona and thus also on the nonspecific binding [13]. Nsubuga et al. [11] observed almost no adsorption of serum proteins on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-and alendronatecoated UCNPs. However, even with PEG-coated UCNPs, nonspecific binding is still limiting the sensitivity of immunoassays [4,14,15]. In two-step assays, the nanoparticle conjugates are not in direct contact with the sample, but the nonspecific binding still occurs [4,15]. Instead of direct adsorption on the nanoparticle surface, the sample components must bind onto the capture surface, to interfere in the following tracer incubation step. The effect of the protein adsorption onto the capture surface in a solid-phase immunoassay, however, has not been studied as extensively as the adsorption on the nanoparticles.\n\nIn this study, the plasma proteins associated with the nonspecific binding of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-coated UCNPs in heterogeneous sandwich-type immunoassays were investigated, along with the possible mechanism",

            "text": "This can be explained by agglomeration of nanoparticle bioconjugates upon coming into contact with the high protein concentration in the serum matrix [34] or the assay buffer, as they are diluted from a high storage concentration. We examined the process by dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments where nanoparticle bioconjugates were diluted in KVG buffer and measured immediately or after 24 h protein corona stabilization. We observed an increase of hydrodynamic radius of single particles corresponding to the adsorption of matrix proteins onto the nanoparticle bioconjugates and formation of a new protein corona (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we observed both fewer and smaller aggregates in the stabilized samples (Fig. 2c). The aggregates represented a particle volume below 5% of the total DLS signal; hence, these aggregates were difficult to measure, resulting in high variation of signal between the replicate samples. The controlled reformation of the protein corona (Fig. 2b) appears to reduce agglomeration-inducing interactions between particles (Fig. 2c), and as a result the immunoassay had higher specific signal, as more binders were available, and lower nonspecific signal (Fig. 2a), as prevalence of large aggregates prone to sediment is reduced. \n\nComponents in the protein corona may improve colloidal stability and increase the activity of the nanoparticle bioconjugates by reducing unwanted interactions or decrease their buffer measured immediately after dilution, sonication, and vortexing (black circles, black line represents a mean of 3 replicates) and one measured after dilution, 24 h stabilization, sonication, and vortexing (red squares, deep red line represents a mean of 3 replicates). c Representation of the aggregate peak of the same DLS measurement; while we observed aggregates only in some of the samples, typically the aggregates were fewer and smaller in the stabilized samples.

Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma.

It is possible that the coating of PEG-modified nanoparticles where COOH and NH 2 groups are available, facilitates the interaction with a larger number of proteins compared with NP-DMSA that only have COOH groups. Other factors to take into account could be the molecular weight of the PEG reagent used, the density of the polymer in the surface of the nanoparticles and the conformation adopted by the polymer [22,65]. In the case of Dobrovolskaia et al. [22], only when they used a 20 kDa PEG were significant differences in total bound protein between the un-PEGylated and PEG-coated nanoparticles observed. Similar results reducing the amount of proteins in the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles were observed by Stepien et al., when they conjugated a 5 kDa PEG to the surface of the nanoparticles [37].\n\nIt is important to mention that the protein fingerprints around the nanoparticles might vary to a certain degree when using different separation techniques [30]. For example, in our work, we detected the presence of serum albumin in the composition of soft and hard corona around the particles. This result is in agreement with Monopoli's [29] work, where serum albumin was identified on the particles after washing three times with PBS. But it is in contrast with the report of Sakulkhu et al. [35], where serum albumin was eluted only after washing with high ionic strength solutions. There are different procedures for separating nanoparticle-protein complexes, including microfiltration, centrifugation, equilibrium dialysis and size-exclusion chromatography. Each method has advantages but also limitations in terms of sensitivity, resolution and reproducibility [30]. We selected magnetic separation to preserve the soft corona (proteins bound by weak interactions) around the nanoparticles by avoiding high shear forces. After this first separation process, washing steps with the buffers were made by shaking the samples and centrifugation. We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is",

It is a general observation that nanoparticles in such environments rapidly get covered by a biomolecular corona composed of proteins, lipids, and sugars that adsorb to the particle surface. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied from an experimental point of view, and to some extent also theoretically and computationally, we still lack a solid theoretical framework. Here we investigate the kinetics of corona formation, particle-to-particle variability in corona composition, and the spatial vicinity of different biomolecules in the corona. We do so under the assumptions that biomolecular adsorption occurs randomly, that adsorption is irreversible, and that there are no biomolecule-biomolecule interactions. We derive analytical formulae but also illustrate their outcomes using for experiments reasonable parameters. Overall, our results, derived under simplifying assumptions, are intended as useful reference points against which both experimental and more realistic computational and theoretical studies can be compared.",

            "text": "It has also been described that zwitterionic nanoparticles lack a protein corona [29]. Nevertheless, corona formation cannot be completely prevented even with the presence of PEG that reduces protein adsorption without lack of cellular uptake [30]. \n\nThe determination of the corona and the comprehension of its dependence on the nanoparticle properties has become of capital importance in nanoscience as can be stated by the large amount of published papers in the last few years. In this aspect, Lundqvist et al. [31] have reported that even for a specific material type, the size of the particle, and its surface modification can completely alter the protein corona and probably their biological impact. Corona proteins can physically mask the nanoparticle surface, potentially affecting the therapeutic effect of the molecules bound to the nanoparticle surface [32]. On another hand, it has also been described that cellular uptake is strongly related to the nature of the proteins that constitute protein corona [33]. For instance, it has been found that albumin pre-loading increased the macrophage uptake of PPEylated(polyphosphoester) nanocarriers while it was decreased when these same nanocarriers where loaded with clusterin. Sch\u00f6ttler et al. [34] have found that, in presence of proteins, PEGylated nanocarriers incubated with 10% of fetal bovine serum were not taken up by HeLa cells in contrast with the high uptake observed in absence of a previous incubation. Not only altered plasma protein composition due to different diseases affects the protein corona but also, the composition of the corona varies among healthy individuals [35]. Thus, the protein source is a crucial factor in the formation of the corona. \n\nThe protein corona-nanoparticle conjunction has raised the interest of many groups regarding not only liposomes but other organic (nanorods, carbon nanotubes) or inorganic particles (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanobones) [36][37][38][39].",

            "text": "In conclusion, this article presents a systematic analysis of the corona formation in both defined (BSA and IgG) and complex (bovine serum and IgG depleted bovine serum) biological samples. We have applied three complementary analytical techniques (NPS, DLS and SDS-PAGE) to study the corona formation, in real time by measuring the corresponding kinetics, and at equilibrium. We also measured the subsequent evolution of the corona by sequential exposures to different biological samples by again measuring the corresponding kinetics and the equilibrium state. As one of the main results, we found that the NPS methodology, which is a new technique in the present context, is able to provide data that are not possible to obtain using standard methodologies in the field. Specifically, at conditions promoting aggregation of nanoparticles in suspension (e.g. during addition of IgG to the SiO 2 nanoparticles in the present experiments), the use of surface associated core-shell nanoparticle mimics turned out to be beneficial since aggregation of the nanostructures at the sensor surface is prohibited. Furthermore, we have shown that the initial rate of adsorption of IgG and the serum samples increased with the size of the nanostructures (increasing ratio of flat/curved areas), in contrast to the initial rate of adsorption of BSA. Thus, the former samples either adsorbed at higher   rate to the planar facets compared to the curved regions, or the proteins (especially IgG) adsorbed with different orientations depending on if the surface is curved or not. The significantly larger NPS response for the serum samples compared to the response for BSA and IgG furthermore showed that these proteins do not have a major impact on the corona formed in bovine serum. \n\nFinally, using SDS-PAGE, we also demonstrated that a formed BSA corona is largely replaced when the nanoparticle-BSA complex is exposed to bovine serum or IgG, in line with the NPS data. Thus, BSA adsorbed to SiO 2 nanoparticles does not prevent further protein adsorption. Similarly, other serum proteins replace IgG when the nanoparticle-IgG complex is exposed to bovine serum.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles (NP) encounter a biological environment, biomolecules will spontaneously adsorb to the NP surface, forming a biomolecular corona. For many biomedical applications, the NP surfaces are designed to elicit the adsorption of biomolecules for bioimaging and biosensing [1]. On the other hand, some NP surfaces are fabricated to limit the adsorption of biomolecules, preventing recognition by the human body [2]. This is especially true for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that must pass through the blood-brain barrier or otherwise avoid clearance from the immune system [3,4]. However, when administered intravenously [5], AuNPs are rapidly removed from the circulation and accumulate mainly in the liver and the spleen due to the opsonization and recognition by phagocytes [3,6]. Many studies attempt to reduce the undesirable uptake of AuNPs by modifying the physicochemical properties of AuNP such as size, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and surface functionality [4,[7][8][9][10][11]. \n\nA well-known method to avoid phagocytosis is to functionalize NP surfaces with polyethylene glycol (PEG), also called PEGylation [12,13]. There are numerous studies indicating that PEG-coated AuNPs reduce the protein corona formation and increase the retention time of the NPs in the circulatory system [14][15][16]. The passivating effect of PEG on AuNPs is thought to be conferred due to a reduced tendency for protein binding to a PEGylated surface [17,18]. As this biocorona layer of bound proteins is reduced, the immune system does not recognize the AuNPs, and therefore PEGylated NPs will persist [19,20]. In addition, PEG-passivated NPs are widely used as drug carriers as the solution exposed termini can be modified with a drug [21][22][23][24]. As an example, doxorubicin can be effectively attached to PEG-coated AuNPs to target cancer cells for treatment [25].",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

            "text": "We initially determined that PLGA nanoparticles enter the body as foreign objects, triggering an in ammatory response in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. These nanoparticles were then engulfed by macrophages, migrated to sites of in ammation and eventually aggravated the formation of plaque. \n\nDuring the injection process, nanoparticles are rapidly coated with macromolecules forming a \"protein crown or corona (PC)\", which alters the size, aggregation state, surface charge and interfacial properties of the nanomaterials to create a biological identity that is distinct from its original synthetic identity. PLGA nanoparticles adsorbed a certain amount of proteins to form the PLGA + PC, with larger diameter and less stability, after incubation with mouse serum. Nanoparticles with protein coronas show completely different cell recognition or biological effects in vitro compared with in vivo [30] . \n\nMacrophages are the most important in ammatory cells in the process of AS lesion formation, are important components of lipid plaques, and serve as an important source of foam cells [40] . Therefore, we studied the effects of PLGA nanoparticles on macrophages in vitro. According to the MTS assay results, the activity of Raw 264.7 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of PLGA nanoparticles and PLGA + PC. The presence of the protein corona inhibited the phagocytosis of PLGA nanoparticles by Raw 264.7 cells. Studies have shown that the role of the protein corona in biological systems can be divided into \"opsonins\" and \"dysopsonins\" [41] . Opsonins promote macrophage phagocytosis, while dysopsonins inhibit phagocytosis. The structure and composition of the corona depend on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, which includes the chemistry, topography and curvature of the nanomaterial. Polymer nanoparticles possess various chemical compositions, free residues and morphologies (such as spheres, rods, vesicles, tubules and lamellae), which provide them with more diverse synthetic identities. After PLGA nanoparticles enter the blood stream, the surface-adsorbed dysopsonins may be more abundant and more stable.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

However, incubation of NF55-SCO nanoparticles in murine serum for 60 min resulted in a significantly higher amount of C3 proteins in the corona compared to SCO alone. That may be caused by higher hydrophobicity of NF55 [81] or its complexes with SCO compared to PF14, and higher absorption of proteins, including C3, [87] on hydrophobic NPs [88]. In case of murine plasma, however, no significant differences were observed between any nanoparticles tested and the amount of C3 proteins adsorbed to nanoparticles was rather equal (Figure 4c  or SCO alone were bound to streptavidin on superparamagnetic beads or beads were left untreated (control) before incubation with murine serum (a,b) or murine plasma (c,d) for 5 or 60 min at room temperature. After pull-down, bound C3 and its fragments were quantified by Western blot.

Here we show that in bloodstream, CPP-NA nanoparticles acquire a novel nano-biomolecular interface and recruit into protein corona anti-opsonising proteins like serum albumin, clusterin and apolipoproteins at a higher extent compared to only nucleic acids-containing particles. Moreover, CPPs reduce inclusion of C3 protein in protein corona on pDNA particles and thereby might prolong circulation of respective nanoparticles in organism before elimination (Figure 3c,d) [83,84].",

            "text": "Those environmentally derived biomolecules presented 'accessibly' 22,23 on the nanoparticle surface with residence times exceeding a critical 'processing time' are deemed to be involved in biological recognition and processing and termed 'hard corona', whereas those that exchange faster are termed 'soft corona' and while they affect physicochemical aspects of the material they are unlikely to contribute directly to recognition. This conception while in broad terms being verified across many fields, has mainly been considered for conventional strongly adsorbing nanostructures 33 where the separation of timescales between the strongly adsorbed hard corona and loosely associated soft corona is great. In the present case of PEG layers, the application of these fundamental ideas is more nuanced. For instance, while it is evident that the 'steady state amount' of exchanging biomolecules in the polymeric layer could affect gross issues, such as circulation time, the modern focus derives from the certain realisation that PEG layers in situ are biologically recognised, and the strong suspicion that the very small amounts of biomolecule implicated in the layer are critical to that mechanism. 3,5 Thus a major interest now is in understanding how (in the above context) those small amounts of biomolecules are presented in the low binding layer and the underlying layer where exchange times are moderate. 26 It is clear that these issues cannot be fully clarified without a detailed molecular understanding of the structure and dynamics of tethered low binding affinity surfaces, such as PEG ligand layers. \n\nPEG layers on flat surfaces have been extensively studied using techniques such as QCM, 34 surface force apparatus [35][36][37] and atomic force microscopy, 38 revealing that PEG coverage largely determines surface properties such as surface friction and protein binding. 12,39 It is suggested that these responses are primarily determined by ligand conformation and solventlayer interactions. 12,40 ][43] In particular 1 H NMR has previously been used, 42,[44][45][46] in conjunction with other methods, 47 to study ligand grafts on dispersed nanoparticles. However, the majority of studies are for small particles (<20 nm) and small molecules (<1000 Da).",

            "text": "Another complication in achieving targeting is the formation of the biomolecular corona. When a nanomedicine (or any nanosized material) comes in contact with a biological environment (for example, blood, interstitial fluids, or extracellular matrices) after administration, its surface is rapidly covered by various biomolecules leading to the formation of a corona [36][37][38][39]. It has been shown that, in some cases, the presence of the corona can mask the targeting moieties grafted on the nanoparticle surface, preventing recognition by cell receptors [15,16,40]. Corona formation can affect not only the targeting ability, but also particle size, stability, and overall surface properties [36]. Recent guidelines have started to highlight the importance of testing nanomedicines in the presence of relevant biological media in order to take corona effects into account [41]. \n\nSeveral strategies have been developed to try to reduce protein adsorption and corona formation. This can be achieved for instance by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface of nanomedicines, or by introdu-cing zwitterionic modifications to make nanomaterials almost neutral [42][43][44][45]. These modifications reduce the amount of biomolecules bound on the surface of nanomedicines after administration (though it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces can still adsorb proteins [46,47]) and usually also lead to decreased uptake by cells. \n\nAt the same time, the corona confers a new biological identity to nanomaterials and can affect the way nanomedicines are recognized and processed by cells [3,7,8,20,21,36,48]. Biomolecules present in the corona can, per se, have targeting capabilities towards particular receptors [17,18,[49][50][51][52].",

            "text": "To circumvent the difficulty in anticipating the biological activity of bionanoconstructs following biomolecular corona formation, ideally, the bionanoconstruct should be designed such that adsorption of this additional layer is obstructed. While no strategy currently exists to fully preclude biomolecule adsorption to nanomaterials in a physiological environment, several approaches have been developed to minimize the phenomenon. 68,76,88,89 One of the most common strategies involves coating the nanomaterial surface with a layer of hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). \u221293 This hydrophilic layer, illustrated in an idealized format in Figure 3b, prevents strong interactions from occurring between circulating biomolecules and the nanomaterial surface, and it allows formation of only a transient soft corona. This soft corona, comprised of weakly interacting biomolecules that exchange rapidly with the nanomaterial surface, does not impart a prevalent biological identity to the bionanoconstruct, unlike the static hard corona formed at the surface of unpassivated nanomaterials. 77,94 To reach a satisfactory level of passivation, particular attention must be paid to the quality of PEGylation. \u221297 Since it can be difficult to obtain a sufficiently high passivation density with long polymers due to steric limitations, shorter, less bulky ligands are often used as backfillers to occupy spaces inaccessible to the long polymers, thus reinforcing the coating. 46,76,77,94 In addition to PEGylation, a number of other strategies have been developed to passivate the surface of nanomaterials including coating with zwitterionic molecules, 68,98 saccharides, 99 and other biopolymers such as polyoxazolines, polysarcosines, polymethacrylamides, and polyglycerols. 100,101 .2.

The presence of spherical fluorescent spots confirms the encapsulation of the dye in spherical nanoparticles Fig. 3b. However, nanoparticles size cannot be evaluated due to the low spatial resolution of the optical light. \n\nPreliminary in-vitro cell tests. PEG-cHANPs in-vitro cytotoxicity is preliminarily studied realizing particle contacts with U87 MG cells. Measurements are performed at different time points and in different serum conditions in order to study the role of PEG in protein corona formation: Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), Human Serum Albumin (HSA), and no serum. DLS analyses show no significant changes in the mean particle size, confirming nanoparticle stability at 37 \u00b0C in each serum condition up to 6 hrs (further details in the Supplementary data Fig. S9). Flow cytometer analyses are used to measure the Forward Scattering (FSC), a parameter representative of cell size and consequently used as an indirect indication of cell viability 68 . \n\nThe FSC plot in time shows that no significant changes in the number of live cells are present in any condition Fig. 3c. Indeed, the contact of NPs with cells is affecting FCS signal neither in different sera nor at different time points. Thus, we can hypothesize that in the in-vitro environment, PEG is conferring to particles a stealth property that could reduce the formation of a protein corona. It can also be concluded that particles are not exerting a toxic effect on cells.",

            "text": "The biomolecular corona A different aspect -which clearly distinguishes nanoparticles from molecular species -of importance for how nanoparticles transport through the blood-brain barrier is the concept of biomolecular corona. 49,50 The biomolecular corona refers to the adsorption of biomolecules from the environment onto the nanoparticle, forming a \"corona\" of biomolecules (Fig. 3A) that covers the original nanoparticle surface (Fig. 3B). The formation of such a corona is important to consider, because in any imaginable way a nanoparticle would come in contact with the blood-brain barrier in vivo, it would do so in the presence of a complex mixture of biomolecules in its environment, all of which could potentially adsorb. Indeed, proteins, 49,51,52 lipids 53-56 and sugars 57,58 have all been found in the corona of different nanoparticles in animal-derived biological media, though the proteins are still the most studied. Furthermore, though which biomolecules adsorb differs, the same general phenomenon of a formation of corona is observed in many biological fluids, 59 from blood serum 50,52,60,61 to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 56 to urine. 59 For nanoparticles approaching the blood-brain barrier, the corona formed in blood serum is perhaps the most important (but not the only; see below) to consider, and this is also the most wellstudied.\n\nIt is a characteristic of the nanoscale, that the adsorption of biomolecules to nanoparticles can be so strong that (some of the) biomolecules will remain with the nanoparticle for much longer than it takes a cell to take up the nanoparticle. [61][62][63][64] This is particularly so for metal, 64 metal oxide 61,62 and other inorganic nanoparticles. 62,63 Still, biomolecular adsorption is sometimes also observed for nanoparticles intended as medicines, e.g., those with grafted ligands, even if PEGylated to prevent unspecific adsorption.

            "text": "In the past two decades, nanoparticles (NPs) for medical applications have been investigated by numerous researchers. The NPs based theranostic agents combine, in a unique formulation, tracking, imaging, diagnosis, cell-targeting and drug delivery properties. In this emerging field of nanomedicine, Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSN) are considered as a promising platform for drug-delivery and cell targeting [1]. However, the major obstacle for NPs' accumulation at the site of interest is the rapid opsonization of the NPs by the liver and spleen macrophages. This opsonization is due to the formation of a protein corona at the surface of the NPs when they enter in contact with biological media [2]. The composition of the corona is particularly dependent on the NPs composition, surface charge and hydrophobicity [3]. Moreover, the protein corona influences the toxicity of the NPs [4]. Different proteins adsorb on native MSN [5], on liposomes prepared with various lipid compositions [6] and in the presence of polymeric groups [7][8][9][10][11]. Grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups on the NPs is well-known to induce a stealth effect of the NPs [12]. The NPs coated with PEG groups present a longer circulation time, and escape the reticuloendothelial system (RES) capture [13]. The PEG coating brings hydrophilicity at the surface of NPs. Water molecules interact via hydrogen bonds with the PEG moieties, enhancing the hydrodynamic diameter of the NPs [12]. However, this type of grafting induces aggregation in high saline concentration solution [14]. In fact, we previously demonstrated that MSN needed a precise amount of PEG in surface in order to avoid aggregation of particles. If the quantity was not optimized, PEG grafting did not improve colloidal stability [15]. Another strategy to produce a stealth effect, less investigated than the PEG coating, is to coat the surface of NPs with a lipid bilayer.",

            "text": "This phenomenon, encompassing the competitive adherence of proteins to a finite surface based on abundance, affinities and incubation time, is commonly referred to as the \"Vroman Effect\" [52,53]. This effect holds considerable significance concerning the distribution of particles within the body. The evolution of the protein corona, occurring as the nanoparticle traverses different body compartments during its circulation, may be influenced by fluctuations in protein levels and binding affinities [54,55]. \n\nThis holds particular relevance for nanoparticles due to the heightened importance of surface effects at this scale. Numerous studies have demonstrated that biological responses to nanoparticles exhibit a stronger correlation with surface area than with mass. Nanoscale materials possess significantly higher surface-to-volume ratios compared to larger particles, as surface areas decrease more gradually than volumes with diminishing size. Consequently, a nanoparticle with a higher surface-to-volume ratio is expected to bind a greater quantity of proteins in comparison to its mass, as supported by existing research [54,55]. \n\nThe impact of varying protein binding on the biological response to a specific nanoparticle remains uncertain, as does the process of protein binding (e.g., uptake by phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system and clearance). However, it is evident that the type and quantity of proteins present on a particle's surface influence the biodistribution of nanoparticles. A comprehensive understanding of the kinetics, affinities and stoichiometries of protein attachment and dissociation from the nanoparticle, as well as the specific proteins associated with the particle, is crucial for a thorough comprehension of the protein corona [56]. \n\nThe predominant focus of research investigating the impact of protein binding on absorption has involved preincubating particles with bulk serum/plasma, preincubating The composition of the protein-nanoparticle complex undergoes continuous changes during the nanoparticle's interaction with the body. Initially, it is highly probable that proteins characterized by elevated plasma concentrations and robust association rates will occupy the nanoparticle's surface. Over time, these proteins may disassociate, making room for others with lower concentrations, slower exchange rates or stronger affinities.",

They profoundly influence the aggregation of nanoparticles and their cellular uptake (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Also, it has been demonstrated that the protein corona composition affects the internalization of gold nanoparticle coated with different polymers (Walkey et al., 2014). Recently, it was found that the \"stealth effect\" of poly(ethylene glycol) may be explained by the presence of specific proteins in their protein corona (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). As summarized by Moore et al. (2015) the type of basal medium can dictate the size and stability of nanoparticles. Results from Strojan et al. (2017) demonstrated that the medium in which silica nanoparticles were dispersed, had significantly affected nanoparticles protein corona composition, suggesting an important implication on nanoparticles potential biological effects. Ji et al. (2010) have found that titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles increased their hydrodynamic in the presence of cell culture media without serum. By contrast, the addition of bovine serum protein stabilized nanoparticles, as there was only a little change in size following the addition of proteins (Spadavecchia et al., 2016). Moreover, as previously reviewed, different surface modifications (i.e. by using biocompatible polymers coating) can be used for lessening the protein corona formation then improving the stability of nanoparticles in liquid media (Iijima and Kamiya, 2009). Based on and in agreement with literature findings (Colombo et al., 2016), we inferred that the small increase observed on 5Au@PT nanoparticle size, in all complete media tested, might due to the higher surface functionalization with T, which decreased the extent of serum protein adsorption. By contrast, the lower amount of antibody per nanoparticle on 2.5Au@PT and 3.5Au@PT may favor protein absorption then resulting in an",

The interaction between NP surfaces and plasma-resident biomolecules results in the formation of a biomolecular corona, which varies patient-to-patient and as a function of disease state. This study investigates how the progression of acute systemic inflammatory disease influences NP corona compositions and the corresponding effects on innate immune cell interactions, phenotypes, and cytokine responses. NP coronas alter cell associations in a disease-dependent manner, induce differential co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule expression, and influence cytokine release. Integrated multi-omics analysis of proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and cytokine datasets highlight a set of differentially enriched TLR4 ligands that correlate with dynamic NP corona-mediated immune activation. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout studies validate that NP coronas mediate this response through TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling. Our findings illuminate the personalized nature of corona formation under a dynamic inflammatory condition and its impact on NP-mediated immune activation profiles and inflammation, suggesting that disease progression-related alterations in plasma composition can manifest in the corona to cause unintended toxicity and altered therapeutic efficacy.",

Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

The immune system may contribute to rapid clearance via phagocytes if molecules in the corona act as opsonins [289,290]. In an analysis of lipid-based carriers, it was observed that if carriers disintegrated in the presence of serum proteins with cargo release, in vivo transfection efficiency was poor, but carriers that aggregated and only slowly disintegrated upon exposure to serum proteins were efficient at transfecting cells [291]. Shielding agents like PEG have been used for carriers to prevent aggregation and to prolong blood circulation time [90,277]. However, PEG may also induce anti-PEG antibodies and result in accelerated blood clearance [292]. \n\nCarriers are more rapidly cleared in vivo if they are cationic and have the longest half-lives if they are neutral [268,293]. \n\nCirculation half-lives are influenced by excretion and clearance by the immune system. The optimal size of nanoparticles should be above 10 nm for preventing excretion via the kidneys, but has been suggested to ideally be not larger than 200 nm, a size that fits well through microcapillaries [156,294].",

            "text": "In summary, the presence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface reduces both membrane adsorption rate and duration. This is consistent with the idea that surface energy effects drive both corona formation and membrane interactions. 12,21,48 In the absence of a corona, the high surface energy of the bare nanoparticle surface makes the particle adhere strongly to the membrane. In the presence of a corona, on the other hand, the nanoparticle surface has already been passivated due to corona formation and subsequent particle-membrane interactions are weaker. Naturally, other interactions could modulate these effects, but they appear to be too weak to change the overall outcome. Aside from the large difference between the presence and absence of a corona, we also observed fewer long-lived adsorption events under full corona conditions compared to hard corona covered particles. Particle size, on the other hand, did not seem to affect the duration of binding, but it did alter the adsorption rate. We attribute this to either reduced dynamics at the surface and/or particle-membrane interactions. Under conditions mimicking the shear stress in blood capillaries due to flow, the number of events reduced substantially, but the average residence time increased. We interpret this as an inhibition of transient particle interactions under flow. Finally, a negatively charged HeLa cell membrane mimicking bilayer showed a decreased number of adsorption events compared to the neutral membrane. We attribute this to the presence of electrostatic interactions between the bilayer and molecules in the biomolecular corona once the particle complex is in the vicinity of the membrane (<1 nm). \n\nNon-specific lipid bilayer-particle interactions have been characterized as a first step towards understanding the more complex cellular membrane-particle interactions. The outcomes reported here are relevant for the interpretation of more biomimetic systems where both non-specific and specific interactions are present. 1][52][53] Our results indicate that, in terms of non-specific interactions, the total number of adsorption events increases with particle size. Thus, the observation of a cell uptake maximum would have to be interpreted with this in mind. However, it remains to be determined to what degree the non-specific interactions investigated here are relevant when cell receptors are present.",

This research 137 sheds light on the complex interinvolve among NPs, EPS, and microbial defence mechanisms, highlighting the potential impact of the protein corona on the antimicrobial activity of NPs. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective strategies for applying NPs in antimicrobial and environmental contexts. Fig. 5 offers a comprehensive overview of the complex interactions among nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems, focusing on forming protein coronas. The protein corona refers to the layer of proteins that adsorbs onto the surface of NPs when they enter a biological environment. This phenomenon has both advantages and disadvantages, clearly delineated in the image. On the disadvantage side, protein coronas may mask the intended functionality of NPs and potentially trigger unwanted immune responses, which could limit their therapeutic efficacy or cause adverse effects. However, the advantages are signi\ue103cant: precoating NPs with speci\ue103c proteins may help them escape immune recognition and prevent aggregation, improving their circulation time and stability. \n\nMoreover, this coating may upgrade targeting speci\ue103city, allowing NPs to reach their intended destinations more effectively. The ability to capture amyloids associated with various neurodegenerative diseases is another notable advantage. 141 he central green sphere represents the NP, surrounded via multiple elements that may be manipulated to control protein corona formation, including speci\ue103c ligands, surface charges, hydrophilic groups, and polymers.",

For both citrate-stabilised and PVP-stabilised silver nanoparticles, proteomic analysis of the acquired corona revealed that 110 nm nanoparticles associated with almost 1.8 times more serum proteins than did 20 nm nanoparticles. 47 The increased curvature of the smaller nanoparticles likely suppressed the adsorption of proteins, particularly those more bulky and rigid. 48 Contrastingly, due to a size much smaller and bigger (respectively) than the most abundant serum proteins, neither 4 nm nor 40 nm gold nanoparticles acquired a complete protein corona. 49 Concordantly, 30 nm gold nanoparticles were reported to adsorb 2.3 times more plasma proteins than 50 nm gold nanoparticles. 50 This discrepancy suggests the effect of nanoparticle composition. Concerning protein conformation within the corona, 6 nm silica nanoparticles evoked a six-fold reduced modi\ue103cation in the secondary structure of human carbonic anhydrase 1 than did 15 nm silica nanoparticles. 51 Similarly, increasing the size of silica nanoparticles from 4 nm to 15 nm substantially decreased the stability of adsorbed ribonuclease A due to increased protein unfolding. 52 The association of nanoparticles in solution is known to both lower their exposed surface area for protein adsorption (which reduces the density of the corona) and induce surface rugosity (which evokes conformational changes in the adsorbed proteins). 53 Regarding nanoparticle morphology, gold nanorods have been observed to undergo greater protein adsorption than gold nanospheres of equivalent size. 54 Likewise, neutral nanoparticles have been reported to bind fewer proteins than their charged counterparts. 55 Between positively-charged and negatively-charged nanoparticles, the former adsorb the greatest number of proteins. 56 Moreover, employing gold nanoparticles bearing self-assembled monolayers of functionalised alkyl chains, it was proved that increasing surface hydrophobicity increases the corona's density. This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As",

In LNP formulations, the dissociation of the outer PEG layer renders particles vulnerable to opsonization; however, likely increases particle cellular association. Chen et al. showed that substitution of more-rapidly dissociating DMG-PEG; which is included in Moderna's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with longer alkyl tailed DSG-PEG lead to a marked increase in particle circulation times, reduced hepatic uptake and decreased dissociation of other lipid components (Chen et al., 2016). It is possible that shedding of the PEG layer from LNP formulations soon after injection can be beneficial, as PEG enables the LNPs to diffuse away from the injection site, but once shed, enables the LNPs to bind to and be internalized by a range of different cells. \n\nPEG-lipids are commonly attached via amide or ether bonds, which are highly stable and thus difficult to cleave (Fang et al., 2017).

Hence we incubated transferrin protein with both NP-F/NH 2 @PMA and with [NP-F/NH 2 @PMA]*2 and the results are described in sections IV (pages 30-48) and VI.3 (pages 64-75) in the Supporting Information.\n\n#4) The authors state that \"there is no agglomeration of the NPs either in blood nor in plasma as no drastic increase in size was observed.\" It may indeed be the case that the particles do not aggregate extensively. However, it is possible that a smaller fraction of the particles form lower-order aggregates (dimers, trimers, etc...) that only slightly skews the effective hydrodynamic radius determined by the Stokes-Einstein equation. Would the authors discuss this possibility in relation to the form of the NMR signal intensity decay? Moreover, there is certainly precedent in the literature for otherwise well-dispersed nanoparticles aggregating extensively upon contact with a biofluid. An additional general discussion of how one might de-convolve an increase in Rh due to aggregation from an increase in Rh due to the deposition of biomolecules is necessary.\n\n\u21d2 The chemical shift window for fluorine is very broad, hence fluorine signal can be very sensitive to changes in the environment and small chemical shifts may be sometimes detected.

This phenomenon implies a reduced blood-circulation time and rapid clearance impairing the reaching of sufficient active agent concentrations at the diseased site. One of the most efficient ways to escape the macrophages capture and the protein corona formation is the covering of the particle surface with a hydrophilic material, such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG) [16][17][18] . In this way, it is possible to increase particle half-life and reduce the toxicity related to unspecific biodistribution 19,20 . \n\nIn the framework of the principles for the production of nanoparticles, nanoprecipitation-based methodologies open new possibilities regarding particle production, size regulation, active agent encapsulation and offer improvements in batch processes being less complicated and time consuming compared to other production techniques 19,[21][22][23][24][25][26] . \n\nDespite these advantages, limitations such as high batch-to-batch variations, non-homogenous reaction environment 27 and insufficient production rate reveal the need to move towards techniques providing a higher control in the production of nanosystems with well-defined features. \n\nIn this sense, the advent of microfluidics constituted a breaking point. This simple, cost-effective and scalable technology poses as an alternative way to implement and consolidate production processes, strongly improving their controllability. Indeed, microfluidic-based production offers the possibility of tuning product composition and properties by process parameter adjustments [28][29][30][31][32] , such as flow rate ratio, polymer concentration, pH and temperature. In addition, when microfluidic platforms are used as microreactors, they provide improved space-time yields (product formed per reactor volume and time), producing faster reactions than bulk counterparts. Moreover, the degree of control over local environmental conditions is such to guarantee homogeneous products [33][34][35][36] .",

            "text": "Indeed, in a recent in vitro study using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, Salvati et al 78 found that proteins in the cell culture medium can shield transferrin from binding to its cognate receptors on cells. Thus, although nanoparticles continued to enter the cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin was lost. In contrast, we previously observed that specific, i.e., FA-dependent uptake of FA-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles by human ovarian cancer cells expressing the corresponding receptor was observed only in the presence of serum proteins, possibly due to a stabilizing effect of the serum proteins on the functionalized nanoparticles in vitro. 104 However, while Fe 3 O 4 -SiO 2 -FA particles were specifically internalized, Fe 3 O 4 -PEG-FA nanoparticles did not undergo specific (targeted) uptake in the same model cell line; it is conceivable that the targeting ligand (FA) on the PEGylated particles was embedded in a matrix of polymers and therefore not accessible for binding to its receptor. 104 ndeed, Dai et al 105 reported that backfilling the surface of a targeted nanoparticle with PEG molecules reduces protein corona formation and noted that the length of the PEG molecules must be less than the length of the ligand linker; otherwise, PEG interferes with the binding of the targeting ligand to its cellular receptor. More recently, it was demonstrated that the formation of a protein corona does not significantly influence the targeting ability of antibodyfunctionalized polymeric particles toward human colon cancer cells. 106 In another recent study. Hadjidemetriou et al 107 reported on the formation of a bio-corona on clinically relevant, antibody-functionalized nanoparticles (liposomes) in mice. The authors found that both in vitro and in vivo formed protein coronas significantly reduced cellular internalization of the antibody-conjugated liposomes, using human cervix or breast cancer cell lines (however, in vivo targeting was not evaluated); notably, the in vivo corona formation did not completely prevent the targeting capability. 107",

            "text": "Selection of an appropriate surface coating may increase the biocompatibility of QDs in physiological conditions. For example, polymer coatings, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been reported to successfully passivate the surface and increase the chemical stability of QDs, reducing their degradation (Wang et al., 2013). \n\nAnother important aspect to consider, when working with nanoparticles in complex environments, is the nonspecific interaction with proteins. Biological fluids contain a variety of proteins, which may adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles and create a layer called the protein corona (Ashraf et al., 2016;Motevalian et al., 2020;Nakatsuka et al., 2018c;Perng et al., 2019;Salvati et al., 2013;Song et al., 2020). Such protein coronas may trigger the aggregation of the nanoparticles, which consequently impairs their functionality and/or significantly reduces their retention time in blood (Salvati et al., 2013). The chemical nature of the surface coating of nanoparticles have been reported as key factors in the formation of the protein corona (Ashraf et al., 2016;Perng et al., 2019). For instance, while PEG coatings in general reduce the protein adsorption on QDs, amine-terminated PEG still induces protein corona formation, while carboxyl-decorated PEG significantly reduces protein adsorption (Perng et al., 2019). \n\nHowever, in some cases, protein corona formation may have beneficial effects on the properties of QDs (Frutiger et al., 2021). For example, the protein corona on thioglycolic acid-coated CdTe QDs increased their fluorescence by inducing the rearrangement of the surface coating and subsequently reducing surface defects (Motevalian et al., 2020). In addition, carefully regulated protein coronas has been harnessed to cloak nanoparticles from rapid clearance by the immune system for targeted drug delivery (Rampado et al., 2020;Oh et al., 2018). Further, human serum albumin protein corona formation has been shown to mitigate the toxicity of carbon QDs (Song et al., 2020).",

            "text": "The question about the significance (and role) of a protein corona on different classes of nanoparticles cannot be answered in a \"general sense\". This is not due to an inherent issue with the nanodimensions of the particles. Instead, it arises from the nature of the nanosystem (nanoparticles and plasma proteins, forming a mixed colloidal system) having an especially large surface area. Thus the system is -to some extend-instable [7,9,74] and the deposition of some plasma proteins -with time-on the nanoparticles is \"likely\". As a result, the popular assertion that any nanoparticle forms a protein corona upon contact with blood plasma is generally true for nearly all nanoparticles. However, some nanoparticles designed for nanomedicine applications do not absorb any proteins and, therefore, do not form a protein corona. This occurs for well-understood reasons: the cores of these nanoparticles are coated with a dense layer of strongly hydrated, hydrophilic polymers, which effectively keep plasma proteins away. This is achieved through a combination of a bound water layer and entropic shielding. \n\nThe next question is: How important is the formation of a protein corona. Now, corona formation can be studied, and the results provides certain insights into highly complex systems. Work on this topic accounts for about 1.500 publications up to the middle of 2022. [7] It excludes, however, mostly the question, if corona formation is unavoidable. In our opinion, the real significance of corona formation has to come, however, from the interest to use nanoparticles in the broad field of nanomedicine. And here, the formation of a protein corona -at least in cases, when corona formation is strong-is disadvantageous. That is because nanomedicine wants to use nanoparticles in patients differing -to a certain extend-in serum protein composition. A central idea is thereby to decouple the pharmacological action of an active compound from its body distribution (e.g., to bring drugs into a tumor, or to bring an antigen and adjuvant to immune cells in the skin, spleen or lymph nodes.",

Pristine nanoparticle dispersions were prepared simply by dispersion in buffer; full corona nanoparticles were prepared by dispersion in complete cell medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum; and hard corona covered nanoparticles were prepared in the same manner as the full corona particles, followed by a centrifugation and subsequent redispersion step in order to remove loosely bound biomolecules. 42 ize characterization of the polystyrene particles was performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) under all three conditions. The insets of Fig. 2a-c show AFM images of the 100 nm particles, which confirmed their spherical morphology (cross sections and larger images shown in ESI Fig. S1 \u2020). 40 nm and 20 nm particles both with and without corona coverage were also characterized by AFM (ESI Fig. S2 \u2020). Height determinations revealed an increase in size upon corona formation and indicated a 5 nm thick layer on all particles, irrespective of ( pristine particle) size. ][45] The colloidal stability of the 100 nm particle dispersions was assessed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which showed that all dispersions remained monodisperse (ESI Fig. S3 \u2020). Additionally, NTA yielded a diameter of 98 \u00b1 12 nm for the pristine particles in line with the AFM measurements. Furthermore, NTA gave diameters of 131 \u00b1 27 nm and 126 \u00b1 Fig. 2 Size characterization of 100 nm carboxylated polystyrene particles under various corona conditions via atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas at nanoparticles was extensively studied, both for single molecule systems and for mixtures comprising the blood serum [1][2][3][4][5][6]. It is generally assumed that there exists a fraction of irreversibly bound protein forming the hard corona and a fraction of less tightly bound molecules forming the soft corona exhibiting a fuzzy, gel like structure. Because of relatively low stability, soft corona composition and structure are difficult to be determined by available experimental techniques, which require nanoparticle suspension centrifugation or filtration steps. Another disadvantage consists in the destabilization of the suspension by the soft coronas, which may promote bringing interactions among nanoparticles. Last not least, the presence of soft corona hinders quantitative investigations of the hard coronas, whose density and structure could be otherwise predicted in an adequate way applying theoretical modeling. \n\nTherefore, one can argue that more reliable results prone to a quantitative interpretation can be acquired if the formation of soft corona is prohibited. Additionally, the reliability of corona formation measurements can be significantly increased using particles of larger size, which yields an adequate stability of such systems. Experimental results acquired for albumins [7], immunoglobulin [8] and lysozyme [9] using polymer microparticles confirm that these systems are prone to a theoretical interpretation. \n\nIn this work we focus attention on myoglobin whose main function consists in oxygen storage and transport in tissues [10,11] as well as the control of the nitric oxide flux in the heart under physiological and pathological conditions [12]. Myoglobin can also serve as a marker of myocardial infraction and acute renal failure [13]. The molar mass of myoglobin molecule derived from chemical composition is equal to 17,800 g mol \u22121 , which was confirmed by neutron scattering measurements [14] and its density is equal to 1.35 g cm \u22123 [15]. Electrokinetic properties of the molecule were studied in Reference [16], where it is shown that molecule exhibits quite analogous charge distribution at acidic pHs to the receptor part of the spike protein of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.",

            "text": "The formation of a protein corona, where proteins spontaneously adhere to the surface of nanomaterials in biological environments, leads to changes in their physicochemical properties and subsequently affects their intended biomedical functionalities. Most current methods to study protein corona formation are ensemble-averaging and either require fluorescent labeling, washing steps, or are only applicable to specific types of particles. Here we introduce real-time all-optical nanoparticle analysis by scattering microscopy (RONAS) to track the formation of protein corona in full serum, at the single-particle level, without any labeling. RONAS uses optical scattering microscopy and enables real-time and in situ tracking of protein adsorption on metallic and dielectric nanoparticles with different geometries directly in blood serum. We analyzed the adsorbed protein mass, the affinity, and the kinetics of the protein adsorption at the single particle level. While there is a high degree of heterogeneity from particle to particle, the predominant factor in protein adsorption is surface chemistry rather than the underlying nanoparticle material or size. RONAS offers an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms related to protein coronas and, thus, enables the development of strategies to engineer efficient bionanomaterials.",

According to their report, neither changes in size nor surface charge prevented the nanoparticles from passing through the vitreous cavity. Nevertheless, the protein corona may affect how drugs are absorbed and distributed inside target cells, as well as how they are removed from cells (Wang, Chen et al., 2021). This may also slow the rate of intraocular clearance of the drug (Del Amo et al., 2017). \n\nSome polymers have been demonstrated to have the potential to help reduce the formation of a protein corona, such as HA, dextran, poloxamine, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Skalickova et al., 2021). In fact, some scientists are developing nanoparticles that can form protein coronas with particular components to perform different biological functions. The protein corona may increase the possibility of nanoparticles interacting with cellular receptors and influencing subsequent biological reactions (Kelly et al., 2015). Yang et al. designed a stable protein corona composed of cyclic RGDyk peptide-modified bovine serum albumin around chitosan-based nanoparticles to reduce serum protein adsorption, which is a novel approach to improve delivery efficiency and therapeutic effectiveness (Yang et al., 2021). In addition to being utilized for therapy, alterations in the protein corona resulting from changes in the biofluid can be utilized as diagnostic tools in a variety of clinical disorders (Vidaurre-Agut et al., 2019).",

            "text": "These results add complexity to the effect of PEGylation, whereby it is unclear if reduced uptake of nanoparticles is due to decreased protein interactions or the formulation of a specific protein coating which results in macrophage evasion.It is possible that the effect observed may be a combination of both actions; however further research is needed to clarify this argument.\n\nThe use of PEG as a nanoparticle surfactant is commonly employed for its ability to provide extended and undetected circulation times within the blood, however attachment of such molecules to the nanoparticle surface must be performed covalently, is notably laborious and difficult to control.Recently Muller et al. devised a novel alternative to coat the surface of nanoparticles with biodegradable polymeric surfactants derived from poly(-phosphoester) in a non-covalent attachment manner.The surface coating -which can be applied to nanoparticles of any species -carries the ability to be easily tuned in terms of length and hydrophobicity to create nanoparticles with tailored surfaces to suit their specific purpose (M\u00fcller et al. 2017).\n\nWhile the vast majority of protein corona studies are designed to investigate the behavior of AuNPs at the nano-blood interface, Mahmoud and co-workers investigated protein corona effects at the nano-skin interface (Mahmoud et al. 2016).By using excised human skin samples, the group was able to investigate the behavior of AuNRs with particular respect to stability by using particles of different surface charges (positive, negative and neutral).Findings suggested that positively charge AuNRs interacted with proteins released from the inner layers (dermis) to form a protein corona which resulted in rapid particle agglomeration.The lack of interaction between negatively charged proteins and biomolecules allowed the neutral and negatively charged AuNRs to maintain their stability when in contact with the skin for up to 24 hours.This outcome has large implications for the development of dermal based nanotherapeutics, particularly for therapies that require the preservation of AuNRs characteristic absorption spectrum, which was lost in the case of the cationic particles after agglomeration.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

            "text": "However, even at a high grafting density, PEG covers cannot completely eliminate protein adsorption. For example, serum proteins, specifically albumin, have been shown to adsorb to the dense polymer brush covering superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with cores smaller than 10 nm and PEG polymers grafted at densities ensuring a brush conformation. Only a few of these proteins were found to bind per particle, but they did so with a high affinity (micromolar dissociation constants), which caused almost irreversible adsorption [46]. Similarly, when PEG polymers were covalently attached at the maximum grafting density possible to the surface of polymer-coated nanoparticles, the particles bound to Human Serum Albumin (HSA) with a low affinity, but to fibrinogen (FIB) with a high affinity. Furthermore, changes observed in the hydrodynamic radius confirmed the formation of a protein corona for the PEGylated nanoparticles. However, fluorescence lifetime and quenching measurements indicated that the proteins were embedded within the PEG layer [47]. Finally, recent studies using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis showed that increasing the PEG grafting density (using 5 kDa PEG polymers with -OCH 3 terminal groups) on a surface caused a decrease in the adsorption rate constants of fibronectin, which were embedded in the PEG coating. However, it also resulted in augmentation of the unfolding of proteins adsorbed, and an increase of the retention times of unfolded protein molecules within the polymeric layer [48]. This incapacity of simple PEG layers to completely avoid the adsorption of proteins caused the development of new approaches for generating alternative PEG shells with improved antifouling properties. For example, the strategy of using PEGs of different sizes previously used to produce antifouling covers capable of maintaining their active targeting capacities was employed as inspiration to generate particles carrying a double layer of PEG shells.",

            "text": "The effectiveness of nanomedicine therapeutic strategies is strictly dependent on the design of the nano formulation since by modulating nanoparticle physicochemical properties it is possible to discriminate between healthy and diseased cells and predict the mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular targeting. However, the translation from in vitro to in vivo studies and from theory to practice is often affected by the complexity of the biological systems with which nanoparticles interact [96]. In personalized medicine, these factors need to be carefully taken into consideration, indeed, drug targeting could be highly affected on the basis of age, sex, target tissues and organs, metabolic differences, and concomitant diseases that can alter different biological parameters. For instance, after systemic administration, nanoparticles are often altered in their outer surface properties by the absorption of serum proteins that can mask the presence of ligands grafted in the nanoparticle surface necessary for a specific cellular targeting. The absorbed proteins, known also as protein corona, could drastically change the characteristics of the nano formulation with consequent hampered cellular uptake, inactivation, and premature elimination [97]. The impact of protein corona formation can be partially overcome by the engineering of nanoparticles possessing a zwitterionic charge in their surface and a global hydrophobic nature [98] or by the insertion of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains with low molecular weight [99]. \n\nBertrand and co-workers tried to understand how the physicochemical properties of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and their interaction with plasma resident proteins could modulate the biodistribution and clearance [100]. The authors found that a low PEG density reduces the nanoparticle clearance whereas a higher PEGylation determines an opposite effect. Interestingly, a total number of 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 represents a threshold value beyond which the circulation time and clearance of the nanoparticle remain almost the same independently from the nanoparticle size. In addition, this threshold value was found to be consistent in organisms possessing different protein phenotypes. On the other hand, the nature of the proteins composing the protein corona varies on the basis of the steric properties of the nanoparticle surface, with a consequent different impact on the circulation time.",

            "text": "As we discussed previously, when the nanoparticle enters the bloodstream it encounters hydrodynamic forces and a corona of bloodstream proteins forms on its surface; a subset of these proteins form the highly specific complement activation reaction that leads to removal by macrophages. Regarding behavior in the bloodstream and the effect of size and shape (Shah et al., 2011), the most suitable method is not MD, but rather a combination of theoretical calculation (Decuzzi et al., 2005) and a discretized continuum model known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), described and used to model this by Li et al. (2014b), Gupta (2016), and Gao et al. (2020) to model nanoparticle transport in the faulty tumor vasculature (Gao et al.). As we have mentioned, the formation of the protein corona is an extremely complex process that still remains poorly understood. What is clear, however, is that the surface properties of the nanoparticle affect this and the mechanism through which the protective polymer corona increases the bloodstream lifetime is modulation of the interaction with bloodstream proteins. Schafer et al. (2017) and Settanni et al. (2017aSettanni et al. ( ,b, 2018 combined experimental analysis with MD to study the interaction between two protective polymers, PEG and poly-sarcosine, with a set of proteins found in the bloodstream. They found evidence that the interactions are not amino acid specific but rather a general tendency dependent on the charge and polarity of the amino acid and the nature of the interaction between the polymer and water, in addition to the direct polymer-protein interaction. Their methodology, synergistically combined with experimental work, could provide a route to a rational design approach to the development of new polymer materials being developed that may have superior performance as a protective polymer corona. Lee et al. used the coarse grained MARTINI model to directly simulate the effect of PEGylation and PEGylation density on the interaction between the liposome and blood stream proteins; Lee also used MD simulation with atomistic resolution to study the effect of nanoparticle electrostatics in protein corona formation (Lee, 2020a). There are other examples of the use of MD modeling to study the protein corona of nanoparticles (",

In such biological fluids, proteins and other biomolecules adhere to the surface of the NPs forming a biomolecular corona that can alter significantly the behaviour of the nanomaterials. Here, we investigate the impact of a bovine serum albumin corona on interactions between silica nanoparticles (SNPs) of two different sizes and giant lipid vesicles. The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane. Our results demonstrate that a protein corona can change the interaction mechanism between nanoparticles and lipid membranes.",

For this purpose, it describes general concepts to control (guide/minimize) the interaction between artificial nanoparticles and plasma proteins to reduce protein corona formation. Thereafter, methods for the qualitative or quantitative determination of protein corona formation are presented, as well as the properties of nanoparticle surfaces, which are relevant for protein corona prevention (or formation). Thereby especially the role of grafting density of hydrophilic polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle is discussed to prevent the formation of a protein corona. In this context also the potential of detergents (surfactants) for a temporary modification as well as grafting\u2010to and grafting\u2010from approaches for a permanent modification of the surface are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting several promising avenues. This includes (i) the use of nanoparticles without protein corona for active targeting, (ii) the use of synthetic nanoparticles without protein corona formation to address the immune system, (iii) the recollection of nanoparticles with a defined protein corona after in vivo application to sample the blood proteome and (iv) further concepts to reduce protein corona formation.",

            "text": "This reflects the dispersion (regrouping) process for all three studied NT3/BDNF concentrations under serum conditions. However, we noticed a higher aggregation (grouping) rate and greater NP size in the serum-free conditions. This strongly indicates the reversibility of the process and its dependence on serum supplementation [19,20,22,28,[44][45][46]. Further, the kinetics of the serum protein's adsorption at NPs is closely related to the specific type of nanoparticle, surface properties, size, composition of the serum proteins, and the local environment. These factors play a significant role in determining the kinetics of the nanoparticle-serum protein complex, e.g., the size of NPs depends on the exposure time to the serum protein's environment [11,18,21]. Here, we observed that significant variations in size occurred not only within 30 min, but also after 72 h of incubation with serum proteins for all examined nanoparticles, which was in good accordance with other studies that showed a time-dependent effect on both NP size and protein corona composition [25,[29][30][31]. \n\nPrior to the formulation of PEGylated NT3-BDNF nanoparticles, we focused on the determination of the electrokinetic charge of the rhNT3, rhBDNF, and PEG chain to further study the adsorption phenomena and NPs' functionality. It has been reported elsewhere that differently charged NPs, irrespective of the initial surface functionalization, display an overall negative charge after protein corona exposure [47,48]. Contrary to our study, Palchetti et al. pointed out that incubation with complex serum resulted in a \"normalization\" of NPs' zeta potential to an average value of \u221221 \u00b1 5 mV. This value correlates with the electrokinetic charge of human serum albumin, which is the most abundant human plasma protein, indicating protein adsorption independently of the initial surface charge of NP.",

            "text": "This review delved into the intricate interactions between proteins and nanogels and polymeric nanoparticles in protein-contacting environments like blood, serum, or cell cultures. To begin with, the conventional concepts of hard and soft coronas formed on nanoparticle surfaces were introduced. This was followed by a comprehensive discussion of fabrication methods of nanogels and PNPs, serving as drug carriers or nanoparticles to interact with serum. Critical factors such as size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity were thoroughly explored, as they significantly influence the composition of the protein corona. Surface modification techniques like PEGylation, enhanced hydrophilicity, and artificial protein corona addition were investigated for targeted protein corona formation. Protein separation and nanoproteomics emerged as intriguing applications of the protein corona, with promising potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. The review covered centrifugation, magnetism-, and chromatography-based techniques for isolating protein corona nanoparticles. While this review aimed to address the primary needs in the field of protein separation and nanoproteomics, several challenges still require consideration. \n\nIn the synthesis and fabrication realm, the use of stimuli-responsive PNPs and nanogels offers the potential for specific protein adsorption and desorption. The regulation of surface hydrophilicity in thermo-responsive materials through temperature holds promise for protein separation applications. Additionally, the synthesis of ultra-small nanoparticles (sub-10 nm) through single-chain polymer reactions presents attractive properties due to their high surface area, but their effects on the protein corona formation mechanism remain an unknown aspect. Scaling up the production of ultra-small nanoparticles poses a challenge, necessitating innovative fixes or regulations of existing methods. \n\nEvaluating the performance of nanoparticles in whole blood or human serum is crucial for identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Sustained microfluidic separation methods may prove useful in this regard. Size-based or spiral geometries for trapping protein coronas offer promising approaches, fostering collaboration among chemists, material scientists, and biological researchers. \n\nThe incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles in PNPs and nanogels holds potential for their efficient use in solution without protein loss and non-specific separation.",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

Eventually, this causes (i) increased nanoparticle solubility in an aqueous environment, (ii) enhanced protein aggregation and misfolding, (iii) protein conformational changes leading to phagocytosis, and (iv) mask the nanoparticle components defining its pharmacological function [161]. Additionally, the HCC environment plays a major role in coronal protein adsorption, including its composition, exposure time, pH, temperature, and shear stress [172][173][174]. These factors have the capacity to influence the composition of the protein corona as well. Several strategies have been employed to date to overcome this phenomenon; for example, nanoparticle preparation with carbohydrate moieties, dysopsonic proteins, zwitterions, and hydrophilic \"stealth\" polymers such as PEG could help escape opsonization, ensuring efficient delivery of the nanoparticles [175][176][177][178][179]. In HCC, it is important to enhance the targeting capability of nanoparticles without the hindrance of the protein corona for the most efficient and optimal targeted therapy considering the above-mentioned challenges that pre-exist in HCC targeting. This can be achieved by personalizing the protein corona using specific noncovalent antibodies for HCC or new targeting ligands considering disease heterogeneity [180][181][182].",

            "text": "Nevertheless, different grades of complexity can be identified when speaking about protein corona determination: one or two page electrophoresis are widely available techniques which provide a first qualitative signature of the protein corona. For instance, Tenzer et al. 104 showed by this technique that protein corona profiles, the so-called protein signature, already differ between 20 and 30 nm silica nanoparticles. \n\nIn a second level of complexity, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has also been used by Tenzer and  colleagues in order to quantify the protein corona of silica nanoparticles with different sizes. The reproducibility of these results could be validated with a correlation coefficient of R 2 . 0.98. The output of LC-MS analysis is that at least 125 different proteins present in serum, bind to the surface of silica. \n\nIn conclusion, specific analysis of corona composition in at least a first level of complexity might be widely available and useful when developing a RM for toxicology. \n\nMoreover, recent simulation methods allow describing dynamics and time evolution of the corona formation. Such models can even be extended in order to model the interaction between an ENP and its target as shown by Dell'Orco et al. 107 -Time evolution of protein corona. Already in the 1960's Leo Vroman reported that adsorption of blood serum proteins to an inorganic surface is time dependent. 108 In a similar way, dynamic evolution of the protein corona onto nanoparticles has been more recently reported: fast or more abundant proteins interact first with nanoparticles surface and are later replaced by less mobile or abundant proteins with higher affinity. 53 Casals et al. 109 explored the formation and time evolution of protein corona formation onto Au-NPs. They show a transition from loosely attached to irreversible attached protein corona over time. The formation of a stable protein corona may take from few minutes, as in the case of silica, 53 up to several hours as for Au-NPs. 109 espite time, also the particle size and ratio NPs/protein may influence protein corona formation. 53,96,109 ig. 8-a shows zeta potential values for Au-NPs in serumrich media depending on time and protein content.",

            "text": "For instance, the functionalization of the NPs' surface with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain through PEGylation was designed to make it biocompatible and to allow a specific interaction with the cells and tissues of the biological compartment. However, the PEG-modified surface of the NPs retained colloidal stability in physiological fluid with reduced protein adsorption, less opsonization by RES, improved circulation, and biodistribution. However, it is difficult to combat the bio-corona formation on NPs [7,8]. In particular, Petry et al. (2019) performed a study to prevent the destabilization of colloidal silica nanoparticles by adding a depletion polymer of Pluronic-F127 and PEG of different molecular weights. The protein band intensity indicated that PCs of varying molecular weights (MW< 17 kDa to >135 kDa) were accessed by a silica particle surface. It was found that the used polymer was adsorbed on surface of a silica particle and BSA maintained the electrosteric stability of colloidal dispersion, whereas PEG and PF-127 governed the depletion force in between the particle. Despite the interaction between the polymer and silica NPs, the protein coating to the NPs surface was not prevented and had the least possible influence on PC formation when they incubated with blood plasma. Thus, the serum protein had a greater effect on the corona profile compared with the polymers PEG and PF-127 [9]. \n\nSilver NPs (AgNPs) have been established and have a wide application in biotechnology and biomedical sciences. Despite their use as biocides, they are also used in tumor therapy, imaging, and as sensing agents. In a similar attempt by Batista et al., incubated polymer-layered AgNPs and self-generated a model protein with the intention to evolvePC. The polymers used for coating as stabilizing agents were polyethyleneimine (PEI), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and poly(2-vinyl pyridine)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEOb-P2VP).",

As a fundamental step towards tuning the immune system by BC, the nanotechnologist will carefully understand factors regulating the bionano interactions, i.e., the interaction between NPs and biomolecules leading to BC formation. 40 e biomolecular corona of nanoparticles Upon exposure to biological media abundant and high exchange rate proteins rapidly cover the particle surface which results in the formation of a fast-evolving \"so\ue09d\" BC made of loosely bound proteins. 41 Over time high-affinity proteins with a very slow exchange rate undermine the so\ue09d BC and form a long-standing \"hard\" BC around NPs. 42 Typically, most studies focused on the characterization of the hard corona as the characterization of the so\ue09d corona is affected by experimental biases arising from the lack of precise protocols for its isolation. For this reason, many open-ended questions have long remained elusive including if the so\ue09d corona is different in composition from its hard counterpart, and whether proteins enriching the so\ue09d BC trigger nanoparticle-cellular interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that only a minor fraction of proteins is unique to so\ue09d BC, while the largest fraction is also present in the hard BC, showing that the same proteins can interact strongly or weakly with nanoparticles or pre-adsorbed neighboring proteins. \n\n9][50] Among them, the protein source (e.g., human vs. mouse serum) is surely the factor contributing most to the enrichment of the biomolecular corona with immunogenic proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement proteins). For instance, Caracciolo et al. demonstrated that two different formulations of cationic liposomes were more enriched in immunogenic proteins following exposure to human plasma (HP) than they were a\ue09der exposure to mouse plasma (MP). 51",

            "text": "The most important difficulty in obtaining a successful translation of innovative formulations in clinical practice is the lack of knowledge of their in vivo performance at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels (Tang et al., 2017). This large gap between the design of nanosystems and their effective clinical application is primarily due to the partial understanding of the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Once systemically administered, nanoparticles are characterized by a significant modulation of their physicochemical characteristics. For this reason, a full characterization of nanosystems is a mandatory step in the preformulation phases of novel nanomaterials in order to improve the outcomes in the development of nanomedicines (Corbo et al., 2016). Upon exposure to biological fluids N of nanoparticles dynamically and often immediately (<0.5 min) interact with biomolecules such as proteins and lipids through a process defined as opsonization when injected into the blood stream, promoting the formation of the so-called \"biocorona\" on their surfaces (Cai and Chen, 2019;Lima et al., 2020). The adsorption of opsonins causes their recognition as non-self compounds, promoting their metabolism and elimination by the MPS, leading to a rapid clearance, low efficiency, and high liver accumulation. Notably, opsonins rapidly identify the positively-charged particles with respect to anionic systems (Neagu et al., 2017). \n\nSeveral types of serum proteins, such as serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, clustering and apolipoproteins generally present in the biological milieu, can all interact with circulating nanosystems (Lee et al., 2015). It has been reported by several studies that the formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process, induced by the competition of various proteins adsorbed onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and it can be classified as either \"soft\" or \"hard\" as a function of the nature of the compounds and interactions involved. Namely, the hard corona presents the first tightly bound layer of proteins over an extended period (many hours), while the soft corona represents a second layer of protein (not directly bound to the nanosystems) facing rapid exchanges for shorter periods (i.e.",

The hard corona is the initial tightly bound layer of proteins, whereas the soft corona refers to the outer layer of proteins (not directly bound to the NPs). 165 The presence of protein coronas may trigger immune responses, leading to the rapid degradation of the macrophage phagocytic system and nonspecific cellular uptake, further affecting drug efficacy and targeting. 166,167 on-ionic surfactants can reduce the nonspecific adsorption of proteins onto nanoparticles, thereby decreasing the formation of protein coronas, which may be owing to the formation of hydrophilic shells on the surface of the nanoparticles, resulting in reduced protein-binding affinity. Additionally, when surfactants strongly bind with nanoparticles, it is difficult for proteins to displace them. 168 PEGylation is the conventional method used to reduce protein adsorption. PEGylated drugs and nanocarriers exhibit extended half-lives in the blood and reduced nonspecific cellular uptake compared with unmodified drugs. 169,170 However, PEG, which is a nonbiodegradable polyether, may accumulate in the body upon prolonged use of drug-PEG conjugates, leading to potential adverse effects. 171,172 Therefore, finding alternatives to PEG is crucial, and non-ionic surfactants have gained attention owing to their non-toxicity and biocompatibility. Mueller et al employed the non-ionic surfactant polyphosphoester (PPE) to coat nanoparticles, offering a simplified approach for modulating protein coronas and their biological effects. After incubation with plasma, protein adsorption on the nanoparticles coated with PPE decreased, and the uptake by the macrophages was reduced. 168 n addition, non-ionic surfactants may influence the composition and structure of the protein corona, thereby altering the interactions of nanoparticles with cells or other biomolecules (Figure 4).",

There are other examples of the use of MD modeling to study the protein corona of nanoparticles (Dell'Orco et al., 2010;Vilaseca et al., 2013;Lopez and Lobaskin, 2015;Shao and Hall, 2016).\n\nIn our previous review publication, focused on liposome based delivery systems (Bunker et al., 2016), we surveyed the work that had been carried out using molecular dynamics modeling, particularly with a model with all atom resolution, on the interaction between the protective PEG corona and the lipid bilayer (Stepniewski et al., 2011;Magarkar et al., 2012Magarkar et al., , 2014. Since this time the methodology has been used to study the effect of exchanging PEG with two different poly-oxazolines, polyethoxazoline (PEOZ) and poly-methoxazoline (PMOZ), with the result indicating that several properties of PEG are highly specific and related to its amphiphilic nature and the ease with which it acts as a polymer electrolyte (Magarkar et al., 2017). We also simulated the effect of change in PEG length, branched structures, and functionalizing PEG to the cholesterol or cholane in the membrane rather than phospholipids and our results complemented both in vivo and in vitro experiments carried out on these novel liposome based delivery systems (Mastrotto et al., 2020).\n\nPEGylation, in the context of other nanoparticle forms than liposomes, has also been studied extensively using MD simulation. Ambrosio et al. (2018) complemented experimental study by demonstrating, using MD simulation with all atom resolution, that a 2:1 ratio or greater of PEG-cholane molecules to the VIP-palm peptide being delivered, is required to form supramolecular assemblies; these assemblies were shown to effectively cover the VIP-peptide with a protective corona of PEG. In previous work we have used MD simulation to study the PEGylation of small drug molecules (Li Y.-",

            "text": "Once embedded in a physiological environment, the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) gets covered with a biomolecular corona (BC) that alters their synthetic characteristics and subsequently gives them a peculiar biological identity. Despite recent studies having clarified the role of NP composition, surface chemistry and biological source (e.g., human/animal serum or plasma) in the formation of the BC, little is known about the possible impact of molecular crowding. To fill this gap, we used a cationic liposomal formulation as a model system and studied its biological identity upon incubation with human plasma, at a fixed liposome-to-plasma volume ratio and different concentrations. We carried out dynamic light scattering measurements to quantify the size and zeta potential of the investigated systems and gel electrophoresis to evaluate the composition of the corresponding coronas. Our findings suggest that NP stability may be compromised by molecular crowding, but the corona composition is stable over a wide range of concentrations, which extend over more than two orders of magnitude. As the biological identity of NPs eventually determines their final fate in vivo, we predict that this study could contribute to the development of a safe and effective nanosystem for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents.",

In a next step, the influence of the biomolecular corona on the stealth effect was determined by quantitatively analyzing the murine proteome of pre-incubated, PEGylated nanocarriers (all with a 50-fold molar excess of linker) via label-free mass spectrometry (LC-MS). All identified proteins could be correlated to eight protein groups and the respective values were plotted as the percentage based on all identified proteins (Figure 4A). In comparison to the composition of the mouse plasma control, the percentage of serum albumin within the protein corona of the pristine nanocarriers (mgHES) increased significantly while the frequency of proteins of all other groups slightly decreased. A similar finding could be observed for all PEGylated samples irrespective of the PEG linker length used, even though the elevation in serum albumin content was not as pronounced as for the pristine nanocarriers. Qualitative analysis using SDS-PAGE further revealed serum albumin to be the strongest band with a molecular weight of about 62 kDa as detected by silver staining (Figure S5A). \n\nAdditionally, the top seven most abundant corona proteins detected in each group were plotted as a heatmap (Figure 4B). In parallel to the protein group analysis, serum albumin was found to be by far the most abundant corona protein for every nanocarrier formulation. While serum albumin presence was detected in the range of 48% (5 kDa PEG-DBCO) to 72% (mgHES), the other six most abundant proteins were observed with a relative abundance of less than 7% each. The whole mouse plasma control group showed a comparable distribution with the most abundant proteins (Figure S6).

            "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated the synthesis and the characterization of a series of GNP-based MRI contrast agents using two sizes of GNPs (4 and 10 nm) fabricated with a gadolinium chelate, either AS1411 or CRO oligonucleotides, and with or without PEG 1, 2, and 5 kDa. UV-vis absorption spectra, DLS, and zeta potential were acquired and reported. \n\nThe protein corona that formed around the nanoparticles was purified from the GNPs and quantified by a BCA assay after incubation of the particles in 10% human serum for 24 h. PEGylation had an increased amount of protein binding with all the GNPs containing AS1411, while it decreased protein binding to the GNPs containing the CRO oligonucleotide. The role of PEG in protein adsorption is controversial in the literature, where many studies have shown that PEG provides a steric barrier that mitigates protein binding to nanoparticles [32,35] while others have reported that some proteins bind to PEGylated particles that do not adsorb to non-PEGylated particles [50,51]. Here, we suggest that the surface chemistry of GNPs plays a crucial role in the ability of PEG to impact protein corona formation, as the difference in the DNA sequence and the length of PEG together dictate the number of adsorbed proteins [52,53]. In addition, the density/conformation of PEG has been reported as an important factor, along with the gold core size, for determining the number of proteins bound to the nanoparticle [35,36,54,55]. Additionally, we have shown that the size of the particles affects the number of bound proteins, as smaller GNPs adsorbed relatively more proteins/surface area in comparison with the larger ones. This finding is supported by other reported studies [56]. \n\nThe cellular uptake studies probed the impact of protein corona formation in the interaction of GNPs with macrophages and cancer cells. Serum proteins, including complement proteins, enhanced the uptake by macrophage cells due to recognition by complement receptors on the surface of macrophage cells.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is \u201cread\u201d by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery.",

            "text": "The charge and surface modifications of NPs significantly influence their cellular uptake, bioavailability, and oxidative stress potential. Positively charged (cationic) NPs tend to exhibit greater cytotoxicity due to enhanced cellular uptake and stronger electrostatic interactions with negatively charged cell membranes [58]. Conversely, surface coatings such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can modify NP interactions and mitigate oxidative stress [59]. Figure 2 represents a schematic of the importance of the surface charge and the coating effects. \n\nIn addition to surface charge and chemical coatings, the formation of a biomolecular corona represents a critical factor influencing the biological identity and toxicity of nanoparticles. When NPs enter biological environments, such as zebrafish media or blood plasma, they rapidly adsorb proteins and other biomolecules on their surfaces, forming a dynamic protein corona. This corona can significantly alter nanoparticle properties, including surface charge, hydrodynamic diameter, colloidal stability, and cellular interactions, ultimately affecting biodistribution, oxidative stress responses, and toxicity profiles [60,61]. Recent studies have shown that the corona may either attenuate or exacerbate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, depending on its protein composition and conformational dynamics [62]. For example, in zebrafish liver cells, protein corona formation was found to influence NP-induced oxidative stress and disrupt glycolipid metabolism [63]. Moreover, time-dependent and species-specific variations in corona composition present chal-lenges for reproducibility and toxicological predictions in vivo [60,61]. Understanding the nanoparticle-protein alliance is thus essential not only for environmental safety assessments, but also for the rational design of nano-therapeutics and precision nanomedicine [61,62]. Cationic NPs show stronger ROS production and cytotoxicity compared to neutral or anionic NPs [64]. These nanoparticles tend to interact more aggressively with negatively charged cell membranes, facilitating their internalization and causing significant oxidative stress.",

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

            "text": "Another factor involved in the biological fate of nanosystems when administered to living systems is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) onto their surface. This corona corresponds to the shell of biomolecules (including proteins, enzymes, lipids, etc.) wrapping nanoparticles upon their entering within biological fluids [58]. As a result, a distinction should be made between the nanoparticle formulation designed by scientists and what is exactly recognized by cells in the bloodstream, i.e., the PC which will dictate the nanoparticle-cell interactions [59]. Depending on the binding strength between biomolecules and the system's surface, PC is generally described as a dynamic multi-layered structure ( Figure 5) [60]. Formation of a \"hard\" corona consisting of high-affinity proteins (i.e., apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and albumin) irreversibly bound with the particle surface is rapidly achieved within minutes upon incubation in a physiological fluid [61]. Weak protein-protein interactions occur between proteins from the hard corona and low-affinity proteins in the second layer, generally designed as the \"soft\" corona. Both layers are in a dynamic process involving continuous adsorption/desorption of proteins on and off the particle with varying kinetics depending on the contact frequency between the protein and nanoparticle as well as particle characteristics, such as surface area, shape, radius of curvature, etc. [62]. Depending on the type of nanomaterial, it has been demonstrated that the corona can have a size ranging between 3 and 15 nm [61]. Therefore, understanding the formation of PC around any nanomaterial is imperative to the applications of SPION as therapeutic or diagnostic nanomedicines as it may have advantages or disadvantages regarding their efficacy. It has been found that the entry route (i.e., inhalation, intravenous injection, oral administration) of nanosystems directly influences the composition of the PC and its evolution overtime in vivo [63,64]. In addition, it has been shown that loss of targeting properties, as well as a decrease of drug release (i.e., release of camptothecin from SPION or paclitaxel from",

            "text": "Identifying the function and composition of the protein corona (i.e., the set of host proteins interacting with nanoparticles) is considered a crucial step in the development of nanoparticles for medical and pharmacological applications. Evidence suggests that host proteins can alter NP stability, biocompatibility, and pharmacokinetics features. Therefore, in this review, we provide an updated conceptual, methodological, and experimental guideline for the study of the NP protein corona. We surveyed recent literature (2009\u20132024) focusing on in vitro and in vivo studies. We show that several methods, including shot-gun proteomics, protein identification after in-gel digestion, and TMT proteomics, must be carefully applied and integrated to shed light on this complex phenomenon. Hence, we discuss in detail the relative protocols, highlighting the importance of the experimental conditions, ranging from the administration route to basic, but determinant, parameters like the kind of biological host fluids, the incubation times and the NP concentrations. Additionally, we propose a series of protocols that involve studying the protein corona using purified serum or plasma proteins, as well as sera depleted of specific complement proteins, to investigate the role of their deposition on the nanoparticle surface. We also explore how the role of the protein corona in inducing uptake by phagocytic cells can be examined; finally, we discuss several methodological approaches to study the effects of different coatings on the composition of the protein corona. Available data indicated that it is possible to characterize and punctually study the differential adsorption of specific proteins onto the nanoparticle surface. This allows designing NP chemical coatings features to actively guide the protein corona formation, thus improving nanotheranostic development.",

Incubation of AgNPs with fetal bovine serum, ovine cholesterol-derived lipids, and simulated gastric fluid are referred to as Scenario 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Scenario 1 represents nanoparticles administered intravenously and interactions with serum proteins. Scenario 2 represents nanoparticle inhalation and interactions with interstitial fluid. Scenario 3 represents oral administration and interactions with stomach acid. For each scenario, nanoparticle suspensions were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Figure 1 outlines the experimental details, inclusive of nanoparticle characterization, incubation parameters, and endpoint analyses. The branched polyethyleneimine-stabilized silver nanoparticles are termed \"Pos-AgNPs\"; the lipoic acid-stabilized silver nanoparticles are termed \"Neg-AgNPs\"; and the methoxy polyethylene glycol-stabilized silver nanoparticles are termed \"Neu-AgNPs\". A comprehensive physicochemical characterization was completed prior to transformations to determine concentration and enable comparisons post-incubation (Supplemental Figures S1-S3).

Moreover, we calculated the absolute amounts of serum albumin and clusterin on nanoparticles by combining the data from the Pierce assay with LC-MS data. As shown in Figure S8, the absolute amounts of serum albumin and clusterin show similar trends as shown in Figure 2d\u2212f. In brief, the protein corona study demonstrated that PEG conformation mediates a specific protein adsorption and shapes the protein corona profile. \n\nThe main feature of stealthy nanocarriers is their prolonged blood circulation, which is due to reduced unspecific cell interactions. To investigate stealth properties of PEG-modified OVA-NCs, we incubated OVA-NCs with bone marrowderived dendritic cells (BMDCs), which are phagocytic cells known to take up nanoparticles unspecifically. 5 irst, we investigated the effect of PEG density on the stealth behavior of OVA-NCs. The cellular uptake of OVA-NCs modified with PEG2k with various PEG conformations was measured by flow cytometry. All PEGylated NCs showed a reduced cellular uptake compared to non-PEGylated NCs. The effective internalization of OVA-NCs in dendritic cells was confirmed by using confocal laser scanning microscopy in our previous studies. 14,28 The increased grafting density resulted in a reduced cellular uptake (Figure 3a,b). From the calculation in Table 1, the thickness of the PEG layer increased from 3.9 to 9.4 nm with an increasing density of PEG2k from 0.2 to 2.5 chains nm \u22122 . The thicker and densely packed PEG layer was more effective for reducing NP interactions with the cell membrane. 25 Remarkably, the cellular uptake was further reduced by the incubation with human plasma. The combination of dense brush conformation and protein corona enhanced the stealth effect of the nanocarriers (Figure 2d), which is expected to achieve prolonged blood circulation in vivo. 29 econd, we investigated the effect of PEG M w on the stealth effect of OVA-NCs.",

            "text": "So far, most studies on the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells have adopted either serum-free conditions or dispersion in standard cell culture medium supplemented with a low amount of (bovine) serum. Serum is added to cell cultures simply for providing nutrients to cells. However, the presence of biological fluids has much more profound effects on the interactions of nanosized objects with cells, due to the adsorption of molecules on their surface and corona formation. 7 Cell receptors can recognize and engage with such corona proteins, and overall it is known that this layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions with cells. 10 Given that corona proteins can be recognized by specific cell receptors, it comes natural to wonder whether this layer can also affect the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized objects. Recent works have shown that the presence or absence of a corona has an impact on the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized materials. 64,65 However, it is not known whether the corona composition (as opposed to simply the presence of a corona) also matters. This is of particular importance given that the same nanoparticles can form very different coronas depending on the biological fluid in which they are applied (thus the exposure route or, for nanomedicines, the administration route) and also on its concentration. 7,66 The implications can be profound. For instance, in vivo, nanoparticles in blood encounter much higher serum concentrations than what is usually applied in in vitro studies (passivating nanomedicines by exposure to serum prior to their administration in vivo may be considered in the future as an approach to try to control uncertainties related to changes in corona composition). Indeed, our results suggest that the corona composition can affect the initial recognition by cell receptors and, as a result, the same nanoparticle can be internalized by cells using different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Potential subtle differences in nanoparticle stability for different coronas could also contribute in part to similar differences and should also be considered.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal",

            "text": "Over time, these proteins may disassociate, making room for others with lower concentrations, slower exchange rates or stronger affinities. This phenomenon, encompassing the competitive adherence of proteins to a finite surface based on abundance, affinities and incubation time, is commonly referred to as the \"Vroman Effect\" [52,53]. This effect holds considerable significance concerning the distribution of particles within the body. The evolution of the protein corona, occurring as the nanoparticle traverses different body compartments during its circulation, may be influenced by fluctuations in protein levels and binding affinities [54,55]. \n\nThis holds particular relevance for nanoparticles due to the heightened importance of surface effects at this scale. Numerous studies have demonstrated that biological responses to nanoparticles exhibit a stronger correlation with surface area than with mass. Nanoscale materials possess significantly higher surface-to-volume ratios compared to larger particles, as surface areas decrease more gradually than volumes with diminishing size. Consequently, a nanoparticle with a higher surface-to-volume ratio is expected to bind a greater quantity of proteins in comparison to its mass, as supported by existing research [54,55]. \n\nThe impact of varying protein binding on the biological response to a specific nanoparticle remains uncertain, as does the process of protein binding (e.g., uptake by phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system and clearance). However, it is evident that the type and quantity of proteins present on a particle's surface influence the biodistribution of nanoparticles. A comprehensive understanding of the kinetics, affinities and stoichiometries of protein attachment and dissociation from the nanoparticle, as well as the specific proteins associated with the particle, is crucial for a thorough comprehension of the protein corona [56]. \n\nThe predominant focus of research investigating the impact of protein binding on absorption has involved preincubating particles with bulk serum/plasma, preincubating particles with specific proteins or attaching individual proteins to the particle's surface, followed by the analysis of uptake by macrophages.",

            "text": "PEGylation is for example a popular way to reduce protein adsorption to nanoparticles. [80] It works by preventing (reducing) the direct contact between protein and (nanoparticle or macroscopic) surface by introducing an additional hydrophilic polymer layer. Due to the curvature of the nanoparticles the molecular weight and density of the PEG coating is hereby of extreme importance (for larger particles an effective shielding is thereby easier to achieve due to the reduced surface curvature). [81] More recently, zwitterionic surfaces, which get highly hydrated, [82,83] have also been suggested as protein repellant coating. [84,85] In fact, nanoparticles with zwitterionic surfaces have been reported, for which an absence of corona formation is observed within the limits of accuracy. [71] Alternatively on can describe such cases, that the apparent K D value of this protein nanoparticle surface interaction lies about the experimentally accessible protein concentration. [85] n this case, it is assumed that approaching proteins interactnearly exclusively-with the hydrated water layer on the surface and (nearly) not with the underlying zwitterionic material. \n\nTherefore, protein corona formation -and its magnitude-depends on the structure of the nanoparticle surface in contact with the proteins (see Figure 1 and Table 1). [86] Interestingly, especially nanoparticles based on hydrophobic materials, such as carbon, latex, or polystyrene based nanoparticles, tend to form a protein corona, likely due to imperfect surface shielding/coverage. \n\nIt is in this context-important to remember that although protein corona formation on nanoparticles happens on the nanoscale and on particles with high surface curvature, it is based on the same physicochemical effects, that govern protein Table 1. Protein corona formation on different nanoparticles (NP) like colloids, polymeric micelles (and comparable structures), liposomes, and nanogels (see Figure 1a).",

            "text": "Huge steps in the production of nanosized materials with specific functionalities have opened the way to a vast variety of applications, one of which is their use as drug delivery systems [1]. A wide spectrum of nanoparticles are being tested for their capabilities to load different kinds of cargos, remain soluble in the biological milieu (e.g. blood, mucosa, etc.), evade secretion and immune response, target specific tissues, and specifically release their cargo. The efficiency of most of these processes depends on how the nanoparticle surface interacts with the biological medium in which it is introduced. These interactions determine the composition of the layer of biological material (protein corona) that forms around nanoparticles as they come in contact with an organism. It is precisely the protein corona that has been shown to determine the fate of the nanoparticle in the host organism, in terms for example of circulation time, cell uptake or immunogenicity [2,3].\n\nCoating of the nanoparticle surface with specific materials represents a very common way to control the protein corona composition. A large variety of coating strategies have been tested in the last few years. A particular strategy consist in the exploitation of the so called \"stealth\" effect, that is the capacity of certain materials, especially polymers, to reduce unspecific interactions with the surrounding biological milieu. Nanoparticles coated with these polymers show reduced protein corona formation and in some cases reduced toxicity. Poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) is the most common of the polymers showing a stealth effect, but recently other polymers have been investigated like poly-phosphonates [4], poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) [5] or polypeptoids like poly-sarcosine (PSar) [6].\n\nThe molecular determinants of the stealth effect are not yet very well understood. One qualitative explanation is that the highly hydrophilic nature of the stealth polymers helps and creates a layer of water around the coated material which, then, reduces the interactions with the surrounding environment. In reality, however, protein coronas form also in the presence of stealth coatings [4]. So the stealth effect may not only be related to a generic reduction in",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly prevalent in our society, with applications ranging from nanomedicine, photovoltaics, cosmetics and beyond. Despite the ubiquity of their use, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how NPs interact with their local environments. This poor understanding becomes a critical problem when using NPs in real-life situations. Notably, it has been well documented that introducing NPs into biological fluids results in the formation of a surrogated biological identity known as the biomolecular corona, which is the spontaneous adsorption of proteins 1 , lipids 2 , sugar moieties 3 , nucleic acids 4 and metabolites 5,6 onto nanomaterial surfaces. The composition of the biomolecular corona strongly determines the ultimate fate of NPs [7][8][9] . As most studies that address the biomolecular corona formation have focused on proteins adsorbed to the surface of NPs 10 , together with the fact that the predominant model for the formation of the biomolecular corona is hegemonized by the direct adsorption of proteins from biological milieus 11 , this Review comprehensively focuses on the protein corona. \n\nThe emergence of the concept of the protein corona in nanomedicine substantially altered perspectives of researchers and interpretation of biosystem-NP interactions. The first critical milestone occurred in 2007 when Dawson's group conceived the term protein corona 12 . However, protein corona studies commenced as early as the late 1950s 13 and early 1960s 14,15 under a slightly different terminology and a colloidal science context. The characterization of protein coronas has revealed that the adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials can have mixed biological effects. Protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and the complexities of biological matrices, can unpredictably change NP outcomes including function 16 , uptake 17,18 , biodistribution 19,20 , immunological responses 10,21 and toxicity 22,23 , and can thus be a challenge for therapeutic nanomedicine.",

Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~25%, reaching 157.1 nm (p = 0.0000; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2b). This significant increase in particle size after the incubation of the samples in human plasma was probably related to the formation of protein corona, thus leading to physical instability of the system [28]. From the presented results, it can be concluded that the prepared lipid nano-systems showed an appropriate stability with a 24 h incubation time in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, as well as in the human plasma, except for the NLC sterically stabilized with POL. These results indicate the possible influence of the polymer for steric stabilization on the stability of the nano-systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo,",

            "text": "In the past few decades, it has been well shown that the protein corona formation on nanoparticles' surfaces influences their in vivo fate and may significantly interfere with the targeting yields, biodistribution, and cell internalization of nano-delivery systems [33,34]. Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands [35]. Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo. For this purpose, samples containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG), nano-carriers covered with POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL), and formulations with no PEG or POL in the content (NL0 and NLC0) were prepared and incubated for 1 h in human plasma from healthy volunteers. The results from the protein adsorption studies are given in Table 2. From the results presented in Table 2, it can be concluded that the formulations prepared with no stealth polymer on their surface tended to have a significantly higher % of plasma protein adsorption (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0290 for NL and NLC, respectively; p < 0.05; ANOVA) compared to the formulations containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG) or POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL). The obtained results were expected, since PEGylation has been a traditionally used method for reducing the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins [21,36]. Similar to PEG, the hydrophilic blocks of POL on the hydrophobic surfaces of lipid nanoparticles are capable of forming a hydrophilic barrier for protein adsorption, resulting in reduced mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) uptake and thus achieving a prolonged blood circulation time [20,[37][38][39].\n\nOn the other hand, it was revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of the adsorbed plasma proteins onto the formulations covered with PEG (p = 0.1448; p < 0.05; t-test) and POL (",

            "text": "Fifteen years have elapsed since the term \"protein corona\" was introduced by Dawson, Linse, and their colleagues [1]. While the adsorption of proteins onto surfaces, such as particles, scaffolds, or implants, has been recognized for quite some time, its true significance in bio-nano research had not been thoroughly examined until the publication of the report. The concept of the protein corona can be likened to the halo of plasma surrounding the sun, where proteins in a solution containing serum form a coating around tiny particles. This analogy draws a parallel between the glowing halo surrounding the sun and the protein coats enveloping particles in serum-containing environments [2]. Recent discoveries have revealed that the formation of a protein corona is driven by thermodynamic reactions in water-based environments, with the goal of minimizing free enthalpy. The process is influenced by underlying physics. Throughout history, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding the nature and properties of protein coronas, employing a diverse range of models and methods from the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences [3]. The exploration of protein coronas holds tremendous potential for diverse biomedical and nanotechnological applications, as it profoundly influences the behavior and interactions of nanoparticles within biological systems. By delving deeper into the complexities of protein corona formation, we can pave the way for more effective and targeted applications in medicine and beyond. In the biomedical domain, nanotechnology plays a crucial role in the development of materials for screening, smart delivery, and medication administration, driving extensive research in this area. When a nanoparticle is introduced into a complex biomedium, it undergoes the Vroman effect, where it initially acquires a temporary or \"soft\" corona composed of large-sized molecules that are present in high concentrations. Subsequently, the nanoparticle becomes enveloped in a \"hard\" corona, formed by molecules with a stronger affinity [4]. Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon conceptually [5].

To allow for corona formation on nanoparticles, fresh MSN suspensions (5 mg/ml; non-capped MSN vs. MSN OC3 vs. MSN SP3 ) in HEPES were transferred to Med 10%iFBS (yielding 1.5 mg/ml of MSNs at 7% w/v iFBS) and incubated for 60 min at +37 \u2022 C with agitation, before being subjected to analysis. SDS-PAGE analysis of the acquired coronas revealed that MSN OC3 and MSN SP3 had similar corona compositions, with both nanoparticle species adsorbing less protein as compared to non-capped MSNs (Supplementary Figure 5).

Despite these difficulties, partially ameliorated by increasing MSN dose, targetability studies of MSNs after corona formation yielded unambiguous results: MSN OC3 specifically activated SSTR2 in the sensor cells at 50 \u00b5g/ml, which in the absence of significant free OC shedding, verified by probing the matched SNs, directly confirmed the retained ability of MSN OC3 to engage the targeted receptors even in the presence of corona (Figures 6A-C).

These in situ approaches have improved delivering efficient chemotherapy with minimum off target toxicities.\n\nRemarkably, for iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) coated with glucose or PEG, it was observed 96 that both surface coatings adsorbed a similar number of proteins in vitro but there was a clear difference in the PC composition which was correlated to the NP biodistribution in vivo. This results in slower degradation of the glucose coating in vitro than in vivo where an accelerated biodegradation and clearance were observed for PEG coating in both liver and spleen. The reason for faster in vivo degradation lies in the composition of the PC. Glucosefunctionalized IONPs had opsonins while PEG was enriched with albumin that degrades faster PEG is known to inhibit the formation of PC. However, it further raised a concern over using PEG for prolonged circulation time due to the \ue103nding of anti-PEG antibodies. 97 As analyzed in vivo by Grenier et al. 98 on PEGylated liposomes and polymeric NPs, using anti-PEG antibodies can have a signi\ue103cant neutralizing effect.

Obviously, plasma proteins cannot be avoided when nanoparticles are administered intravenously in patients, and the grafting of PEG or other polymers onto nanoparticle surfaces may reduce, but will not completely prevent protein corona formation [35]. Therefore, the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules needs to be taken into account in the design of any nanoparticle for clinical use, and the formation of a (specific) corona could also be exploited to confer novel advantageous properties to nanoparticles [11]. The present proteomics study has provided an inventory of human plasma proteins with affinity for silica-and dextran-coated SPIONs that may prove useful in further optimization of SPIONs for medical imaging.",

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

Adsorption of proteins like fibrinogen or ribonuclease A to nanomaterials can also lead to destabilisation of their structure, e.g. by partial unfolding altering their function and promoting particle aggregation. [56][57][58] This does not seem to be a universal process. For instance, protein adsorption on nanoparticles with high curvature actually improves protein stability and retains enzymatic functions, for example, for soy bean peroxidase, lysozyme and human carbonic anhydrase. 56 Pre-coating of nanoparticles with a single protein-like albumin has been shown to increase colloidal stability and reduce binding of opsonins (C3, IgGs), consequently reducing nanoparticle uptake by macrophages. 59 Protein coating of nanomaterials can also be further exploited for the attachment and proteolytic release of drugs. 60,61 An increasing number of studies have revealed that the composition and presence of a protein corona is dependent on the nanoparticle size, charge, shape, surface functionalization and incubation time. 54,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71] While most studies have suggested a limited complexity of protein coronas of several dozens of proteins, a recent quantitative proteomic study identified up to 300 different proteins in the protein corona of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles. 68 Protein adsorption from serum occurred within minutes and the corona composition changed little with prolonged exposure time. In addition, the authors observed that the particle net charge after corona formation was negative independent of the initial particle charge. 68,69 The great majority of studies have",

However, the recent studies indicated that it was not always the significant correlation between in vitro and in vivo corona due to the wide variety of molecular species in the in vivo corona, dynamics of blood flow, interaction with circulating and endothelial lining cells, and immune responses. Unfortunately, the in vivo corona evaluation is challenging because of the insufficient recovery of the nanoparticles following administration [61][62][63] . \n\nAlthough the in vitro and ex-vivo corona studies outcomes is uncertain, it could be useful for some initial predications. In this study, we could find an agreement between quantity and composition of PEC protein corona and nanoparticle biodistribution based on LC-MS/MS spectroscopy and SDS-page electrophoresis results and initial size of our nanoparticles without corona. conclusion Protein corona influences biodistribution and cell internalization of nanoparticles. To improve the biodistribution and enhance the circulation time of chitosan based nanoparticles, the biointerference of the PECs of chitosan and dextran were thoroughly investigated. Chitosan and CMD/TD PECs have thin protein corona layer, in compare with inorganic nanoparticles, mostly consists of lipoproteins, protein C, and hemoglobin which could affect the biodistribution and cellular uptake of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles possess the long circulation time with low liver uptake due to their suitable size distribution in serum. The heart tissue uptake of the PECs was minor and could be due to the lipoprotein enriched corona structure. By considering the obtained results beside biocompatibility and safety of the chitosan and dextran, we conclude that the presented modified nanoparticles could be suggested as prosperous gene and drug delivery systems.",

            "text": "In parallel to the protein group analysis, serum albumin was found to be by far the most abundant corona protein for every nanocarrier formulation. While serum albumin presence was detected in the range of 48% (5 kDa PEG-DBCO) to 72% (mgHES), the other six most abundant proteins were observed with a relative abundance of less than 7% each. The whole mouse plasma control group showed a comparable distribution with the most abundant proteins (Figure S6). \n\nApart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3-induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1). Multi-angle dynamic light scattering revealed a larger size of pristine nanocarriers compared to the PEGylated formulations in protein-free media, and a smaller particle size under protein corona conditions. This might be due to changes in the light scattering properties and/or a reduction in aggregation after PEGylation. Regarding the surface charge of the nanocarriers, all samples presented a rather neutral zeta potential, which consistently appeared slightly negative for all mouse plasma pre-incubated nanocarrier formulations.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) serve as potential vehicles for drug and nucleic acid research. However, their mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. The implications of this limited understanding of in vitro data mean that the physiological response to NPs in vivo cannot be predicted. Biomolecular coronas (BCs) formed on NPs by their contact with biofluids are of great importance in molecular medicine [203,204]. BCs are influenced by various factors, such as size, temperature, surface charge, hydrophobicity, incubation time and protein source. This premise is further explored to associate disease-specific protein changes with BC composition to gain deeper insight into personalized BCs. BCs may be able to distinguish cancer patients from normal patients and understand disease progression. The current research is focus on discovering new mechanisms to generate crowns through applying shear stress [203,204]. Previously, the process of incubating NPs with human serum (HS) or human plasma (HP) was used to adsorb blood proteins. Recent research shows that the sheer stress of a \"laminar fluid flow\" compared to static incubation leads to the formation of more complex coronae [205][206][207]. It is expected that this form of dynamic flow will provide a better understanding of actual physiological processes. MF provides a standardized environment for performing dynamic incubation protocols as the reproducibility is far greater than conventional silicone tubing and peristaltic pumps [204]. \n\nDigiacomo et al. [204] investigated the role of MF in this field by using gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to explore their plausibility in chemotherapy research and drug delivery in cancer. GNPs can activate multiple juxtaposed receptor sites and increase cellular uptake. They possess surface plasmon resonance and can efficiently convert light to heat, localize the effect of temperature, and induce rapid cell death. The analysis showed that the sheer stress of an MF environment leads to the formation of more negatively charged NPs and affects protein composition. Future meta-analysis will be possible by standardizing the composition and formation of BCs [203,204]. Changing the size and shape of GNPs may lead to different results [208].",

            "text": "Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.Specifically, faster PEG shedding led to attenuated production of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicating that optimization of the kinetics of PEG shedding can improve the circulation and biodistribution of LNPs in the body.Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of siRNA-loaded LNPs could be influenced by the desorption rate of PEG.It is essential to understand the kinetics of PEG dissociation, as it directly impacts the duration and effectiveness of the therapeutic payload in target tissues.Mui et al. [35] first investigated the gene knockdown efficiency associated with PEG length and PEG content within LNPs.Their group found that hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes were proportional to the PEG alkyl length.Specifically, when fixing PEG content at 1.5%, C16 and C18 PEG need more time to shed from the surface of LNPs compared to C14 PEG.When increasing the PEG content from 1.5% to 3%, C14 PEG LNPs showed a gradual decline in gene knockdown, while C18 PEG completely lost its function when its content was higher than 1.5%.This phenomenon can be attributed to the longer alkyl length of C18 PEG, which increased the hydrophobicity of PEG lipid, and hindered the interaction with the cell membrane.As a result, longer alkyl length required more energy for LNPs to adopt a monolayer transition state, leading to shedding of PEG from the LNP surface.Thus, C18 PEG has a longer circulation time after administration but still holds its ability with 1.5% threshold concentration.\n\nIn another aspect, PEG shedding is due to the pH change during the endocytosis process.A study by Hashiba and colleagues [68] demonstrated the benefits of pH-labile PEGylation in siRNA-loaded LNPs for hepatocyte targeting and gene silencing activity.The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.",

Actually, it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces acquire the ability to reduce clearance by immune cells thanks to the adsorption of specific proteins in their corona. 20 iven the many effects of the protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells, understanding which corona components and cellular receptors can affect the biological fate of nanoparticles is important for improving the design of nanocarriers. \u221213 This opens up new ways for the improvement of nanocarrier targeting by exploiting interactions mediated by their corona, as for instance, it was demonstrated for approved nanomedicines currently in the clinic. 21 \u221225 Thus, nanoparticles may be tailored to adsorb specific biomolecules in their corona and, in this way, be directed to specific cell receptors. 16,17 \u221228 Similarly, by correlating the composition of the corona formed on different nanoparticles and their cell uptake efficiency, corona proteins that can promote or reduce uptake by cells have been identified. 28,29 For instance, a previous study in which this approach was applied discovered that apolipoproteins (ApoH, ApoA4, and ApoC3) were responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake in human mesenchymal stem cells. 29 ince different cell types may have different interactions with the protein corona, by comparing the association in multiple target cells new strategies for targeting specific cells may be discovered.",

            "text": "In other words, the biomolecular corona formed in surfactantcontaining media becomes less biocompatible, with its composition varying based on the surface properties of the NPs. \n\nInvestigation of the lipid and protein corona composition after exposure to pulmonary surfactants from porcine lung lavage was reported by Raesch et al. 23 The study was performed for three different NP coatings: phosphatidylcholine coating (lipid-NP), PEG5000 coating (PEG-NP), and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) coating (PLGA-NP). It was found that the amount of lipids adsorbed was dependent on the NPs' surface properties. In particular, the highest amount of lipids was detected for lipid-NPs, while the smallest amount was detected for PEG-NPs. However, the total lipid composition did not show any relevant differences in both coronas, in contrast to the changes observed in the protein composition. These results indicate that the corona might be of great importance for further interactions with the lung cells, especially in the alveolar region, since some proteins induce agglomeration of NPs, which in turn favours phagocytosis by macrophages and/or protein-mediated binding for particle internalisation. Gasser et al. also used porcine lung lavage to understand how the presence of pulmonary surfactant influences the adsorption of biomolecules to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MWCNTs functionalised with positively (-NH 2 ) and negatively (-COOH) charged side groups. 111 They showed that surfactant lipids exhibit nonspecific binding to different functionalized MWCNTs. This behavior contrasts with the selective and characteristic binding patterns observed in the blood plasma proteins during corona formation. In later research, they used the same particles to demonstrate that the pulmonary surfactant coating of the nanotubes decreases their oxidative and pro-inflammatory potential, highlighting the relevance of the corona. Moreover, this surfactant coating not only affects how NMs interact with lung cells, but also affects their biodistribution and toxicity in secondary target organs. 112 In vivo studies also support the latter findings.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles enter a biological fluid, proteins and other biomolecules compete for the nanoparticle surface, thus leading to the formation of a protein corona that defines the biological identity of the particle [1]. The corona is dynamic in nature and its composition varies over time due to continuous protein association and dissociation events. Eventually equilibrium is established, at which point the concentrations of free and bound proteins are such that for each protein the association and dissociation rates have become equal and the continued exchange will not affect the composition of the corona. However, the corona will again change composition if the nanoparticle moves to another compartment or fluid [2]. Particle material, size and surface properties have been found to play a significant role in determining the composition of the corona [1][2][3][4]. The term ''hard corona'' defines the long-lived equilibrium state, representing a fingerprint of a nanoparticle in a certain environment [2]. Understanding the time evolution of the protein corona in a given biological fluid, and in particular the time-scales on which particle-associated proteins exchange with free proteins, enables predictions of the particle's fate as regards interactions with specific receptors or predictions of its life time in blood. Such understanding will have impact both on nanomedicine and on nanotoxicity. \n\nIn this work, we present a simple and effective mathematical model that describes the kinetics of the corona formation around a copolymer nanoparticle based on experimentally determined association and dissociation rate constants. This is to our knowledge the first attempt to model the competitive nanoparticle-protein interaction kinetics that contributes to the formation of the corona. Parameters determined in our previous studies [1][2][3][4][5][6] and by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements performed in this study, as well as data taken from the literature, were introduced in the model to describe the interaction of three human plasma proteins with copolymer nanoparticles.",

            "text": "PEG-lipids comprise a hydrophilic PEG polymer covalently bound to a hydrophobic lipid anchor; they include DSPE-PEG and N-[(methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)2000)carbamoyl]-1,2dimyristyloxlpropyl-3-amine (PEG-C-DMA) (Fig. 4D). The incorporation of a PEG-lipid into lipid nanovehicles increases colloidal stability in vitro. For example, without a PEG-lipid, the ethanolic environment and low pH of the LNP manufacturing process can accelerate particle fusion to induce particle size amplification. Moreover, PEG-lipids in lipid nanovehicles can prevent serum protein opsonization and MPS clearance and thus prolong their circulation time in vivo. A longer retention time in the blood means that the particles are more likely to distribute to disease sites, such as solid tumors, via the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nHowever, a PEG polymer can form a steric barrier that prevents cellular uptake and endosome escape, decreasing RNA delivery efficiency 79 . Various strategies have been developed to address this dilemma. First, PEG can be adopted at a low mole percentage. For example, Semple et al. 58 revealed that a 5-fold increase in siRNA's in vivo delivery efficiency was achieved when the PEG content was decreased from 10% to w1.5%. Second, a PEG-lipid with a short hydrophobic tail can be used. For instance, PEG-C-DMA carries a relatively short myristic lipid anchor (14 carbons), not a stearoyl (18 carbons) tail, as in DSPE-PEG. Thus, PEG-C-DMA gradually detaches from the LNP surface in the circulatory system 80 . This detachment of PEG-C-DMA reduces the PEG density, which is conducive to liposome interaction with cellular or endosomal membranes and, thus, better intracellular delivery. Third, PEGlipids can be covalently decorated with ligands to target cellspecific membrane receptors to increase the cellular uptake of the lipid nanovehicles.",

            "text": "organism, i.e., biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. It was observed that the adsorption of plasma proteins leads to reduced accessibility or interaction between exogenously incorporated ligands and their targeted receptors (Fig. 5). For example, several studies reported that transferrin-coated nanoparticles showed reduced or lacking specificity towards TfR in presence of the protein corona as a result of ligand blockade [260][261][262]. The resulting \"biological identity\" was highly dependent on the composition of the protein corona. In particular, in vitro protein corona depleted targeting capability, whereas a protein corona resembling in vivo conditions caused only a reduction in specific receptormediated uptake [261].\n\nInterestingly, two studies could prove that the in vivo protein corona even enhanced the overall uptake of the nanoparticles, hypothesizing redirection of cellular uptake by the protein layer and opening new paths for particle internalization [262,263]. As a consequence, plasma protein adsorption could also lead to redirected transport to off-target cells such as the RES, which hampers selective nucleic acid delivery and efficacy. In addition, Tonigold et al. observed that antibodies covalently bound to nanoparticles lose their targeting ability almost completely in presence of serum. Particles with physically adsorbed antibodies, however, maintained their targeting ability, probably due to the fact that these antibodies were not completely exchanged or masked by serum proteins [85].\n\nTraditionally, masking the surface properties causing plasma protein adsorption is a key strategy to overcome this issue and to maintain targeting ability. PEGylation has proven to reduce undesired interactions and consequently retain ligand-accessibility which is essential for targeted delivery in vivo [41]. One approach to further attenuate particle interaction with plasma proteins is PEG \"backfilling\" (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the surface of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264",

About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

            "text": "The biomolecular corona effectively determines the identity of nanoparticles (NPs) in a biological environment. 1 The formation of biomolecular corona can significantly alter the physical and chemical properties of the NP (e.g., size, charge, and hydrophobicity). 2 These changes can affect the NP's stability, aggregation, and circulation time in the body. 3 herefore, a thorough understanding of the biomolecular corona and its effects on the physicochemical properties and colloidal stability of NPs can guide their design to minimize adverse effects, making them safer for clinical applications. 4 raditionally, several methods such as liquid chromatography\u2212tandem mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis were used to be utilized to determine the corona composition. 5 hese methods commonly relay on an assumption that the NPs in each population behave similarly as far as protein adsorption to their surface is concerned and provide an averaged determination of corona composition for a given NP population. \n\nWhile various techniques, such as centrifugation, have been employed to isolate hard corona-coated NPs, 6 achieving a comprehensive in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona remains a significant challenge in the field. 7,8 The term \"in situ biomolecular corona\" refers to the corona formed on the surface of NPs in the presence of excess proteins and biomolecules. The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

However, the technique failed to detect a shift for the NPs-PMA-protein corona complexes for f 5 and 25 nm sized particles of this particular density, highlighting a possible limitation of this technique. This lack of shift in the measured diameter after sedimentation of 5 and 25 nm sized AuNPs could either implicate that the biomolecular corona forming around such small particles is rather a transient corona than the tightly and nearly irreversibly bound biomolecular layer i.e. \"hard corona\", or that DCS may not be an ideal technique to resolve the NP-biomolecular corona complexes for small particles with a low density and the full characterisation would require different measuring techniques. \n\nTo address the presence of the biomolecular corona around 5 nm particles, we focused on the 5 nm Au-PMA particles and applied multiple methods to evaluate whether the strongly bound biomolecular corona is formed around these particles. For further characterisation, agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) was applied, as the NPs generally migrate towards the anode as the travel through the gel pores, but any small changes in the particle surface, e.g. functionalisation with the organic ligands or indeed the biomolecular corona formation, might lead to a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the particles. Figure 3a shows that there is a clear electrophoretic mobility difference for the NPs after exposure to blood plasma, indicating that the formation of the corona influences the migration through the agarose gel, compared to the pristine ones. \n\nThe NPs with strongly bound biomolecular coronas, i.e. \"hard corona\" (HC) were isolated using centrifugation and we applied multiple washes to remove the unbound and loosely bound biomolecules from the corona 9 . However, due to their small size, we used an ultracentrifugation with a sucrose cushion to sediment the NPscorona complexes.",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016).

Surface modification of nanostructures using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments has been evaluated as an approach to address this barrier [23,24]. The PEGylation level at particle corona, the size, the composition, the surface charge and the shape of NPs are some of the features determining RES interactions.

            "text": "When nanoparticles come in contact with biological fluids, proteins rapidly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface conferring them a new biological identity [56]. In order to investigate protein adsorption on the model nanoparticles described above, the latter were incubated with either human blood serum or plasma for 1 h, (Figure 3A). The loosely bound proteins were removed by several washing steps (described in the methods section) and the nature and number of adsorbed proteins forming the so-called hard corona were analyzed. It is relevant to mention that both hard and soft protein corona exert an influence on the cellular response. However, while the soft protein corona presents a dynamic exchange, the hard protein corona rests strongly bound to the nanoparticles surface for longer time. Immune cells are therefore inevitably bound to interact with the hard corona over time [57]. The molecular weight and composition of the adsorbed protein corona was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteins isolated from the corona formed on the surface modified silica nanoparticles showed an intricate band pattern; this is evidence that the hard protein corona is a complex mix of proteins extending over a wide range of molecular weights and densities. Consistent with previous studies, the amount and nature of the proteins in the nanoparticles corona did not correlate with their relative abundance in the respective biological media, Figure 3B,C [58,59]. The major bands present in serum and plasma controls (e.g., red arrows) are not necessarily present with the same intensity on the nanoparticles' corona. Quantification of the total amount of proteins adsorbed was performed by Pierce colorimetric assay as previously described (Figure S4) [61]. The data shows a correlation The black arrows point to small molecular weights proteins present in the coronas that are not visible in the plasma and serum controls. Such discrepancy has been reported before and seems to be driven by electrostatic binding and steric effects linked to the nanoparticles physico-chemical properties [23]. We have previously studied the formation of serum protein corona on planar surfaces coated with comparable plasma polymers [52].",

            "text": "Functionalization of lipid nanoparticles with PEG has several advantages in the design of drug delivery systems [56]: PEG is commonly used to coat nanoparticles aiming to prevent aggregation and avoid phagocytosis, thus, increasing their residence time in the circulating blood; it also interferes in the formation of molecular corona on the nanoparticles [43]. PEG can be incorporated in the formulation as a pure component, or covalently linked to one of the lipids present in the formulation (PEGylated lipids). PEG creates a hydrophilic shell on the surface of lipid nanoparticles, which inhibits the desorption of drugs, particularly hydrophobic molecules that are encapsulated in the nanoparticle core. PEG molecules grafted on the surface also allow for accommodating a larger amount of hydrophilic drugs into core-shell nanoparticles, because they do not occupy space inside the nanoparticle [57]. \n\nLiposomes are promising tools for the delivery of antitumoral drugs. In order to reach the therapeutic target, they must resist the extracellular matrix (ECM). Aiming to mimic such an environment, Bandara and coworkers studied the effect of exposure to hydrogels composed of gelatin, alginate, PEG and the commercial ECM Matrigel \u00ae on DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) liposomes. The structural features of the liposomes before and after exposure to the hydrogel were studied with SAXS. Their results showed that once exposed to the extracellular matrix, DOPC liposomes turn to multilamellar vesicles, and form aggregates of micrometer size. Adding a small amount of PEGylated DOPE (1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) to the liposome formulation, the formation of a PEG corona reduced the extent of liposomes aggregation, which has important implications for stability and immune responses [58].",

Result of this competition is a dynamic 'cloud' of proteins around the NPs, which continuously changes over time. In the beginning seconds to minutes of this interaction, the more abundant blood proteins such as albumin will be dominant in the corona. 9 Over time, proteins with higher affinity (and lower concentration) will take over the space close to the NP's surface and proteins with lower affinity will be attached more loosely in the outer layers around the NP. 9 This kinetically driven evolution of the corona over time is commonly referred to as 'Vroman-effect'. 10 Common nomenclature for the more tightly bound proteins is the so called 'hard' protein corona, while loosely bound proteins are considered 'soft' corona proteins. 11 Properties of proteins and nanoparticles alike influence their intermolecular interactions with each other. NPs' properties of interest include size, 12 surface charge and functionalization, 11 stabilizing surfactants, 13 and hydrophilicity. 14 On the other hand, the proteins' properties of interest address their amphiphilic character, which leads to screening of hydrophobic parts of the protein from the surrounding water. 15 Similarly, smaller hydrophobic molecules can be transported by amphiphilic proteins such as lipids attached to apolipoproteins. 16 This amphiphilic nature in turn also leads to preferred interaction with other surfaces such as nanomaterials. The main forces governing the interfacial interactions between nanomaterials and biological systems are listed in Fig. 1 and in Table 1. 8 Remaining questions in the field include (but are not limited to) the possibility of protein-multilayers in the corona, 17,18 the exact mechanism of the Vroman effect with influence of kinetics on the protein corona, 10,19,20 and",

            "text": "When nanoparticles are presented to a physiological environment such as human plasma they selectively absorb biomolecules to form a so-called biomolecular corona on the surface of the nanoparticle [9]. Needless to say, one should be aware of the fact that nanoparticles -indeed, any material surfaces -may be coated with bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane component of all Gram-negative bacteria, especially if the nanoparticles are synthesised under non-sterile conditions. This could give rise to interference with the biological assessment of nanomaterials eg. induction of maturation of dendritic cells (DC) [10]. However, of more importance for the present discussion, several studies in recent years have provided evidence for a \"hard\" (long-lived) corona of human plasma proteins on nanoparticles of different chemical composition [11][12][13][14]; the formation of the hard corona was shown to depend on both size and surface properties eg. degree of hydrophobicity [15]. The bio-corona has been reported to impact on cellular uptake [16] and on cell signaling including NF-\u043aB-dependent cytokine production in THP.1 cells [17]. Notably, lipids, not only proteins, may also feature prominently in the bio-corona, as shown recently for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) administered into the lungs of mice [18], and the combined lipid-protein corona may play a role in cellular uptake of nanomaterials. The notion that naked particle surfaces may not exist in nature has profound implications as the bio-corona may convey a new biological \"identity\" to nanoparticles [19]. This is, in a manner of speaking, a case of the Emperor\u00b4s new clothes in reverse; hence, the Emperor is not naked as we thought but fully \"clothed\" in a layer of biomolecules. In fact, some studies have even provided detailed information on the thickness of this layer, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [20].",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate that only a neglectable amount of plasma proteins is found on polymeric nanocarriers with dense surface coatings of PEG, pSar or pHPMA. None of the nanoparticles increased in size after incubation and isolation from human plasma, while only non-significant signs of proteins could be detected applying SDS-PAGE with the very sensitive silver staining (subnanogram detection). Interestingly, the amount of plasma proteins is found to be significantly less than one equivalent human serum albumin protein (66 kDa) per nanocarrier for all the three evaluated systems. Thus, most of the nanocarriers are not associated with any protein at all. This is clearly much less protein adsorption than previously observed for other colloidal nanoparticles [10,26,63] and it does by no means correspond to a dense protein corona as it is often discussed for nanoparticles. Therefore, intensive corona formation is not a general property of nanoparticles, which is in accordance with recent findings for nanoparticles coated with zwitterionic structures [61,62] and some liposomes. [19] It is, however, noteworthy that even under these conditions it is possible to identify the enriched proteins in the fractions of the studied polymeric nanocarriers by applying label-free quantitative proteomic analysis with mass spectrometry. Nevertheless, the presented methodology requires negative controls and carefully conducted background subtraction techniques to avoid misleading conclusions.\n\nSince all nanocarriers provide significantly high plasma circulation times, our results clearly demonstrate that this is a property of the carrier system itself and cannot be explained by protein corona formation. These findings may explain the neglectable patient variability of PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers in clinical phase II (CPC634), [21,52] and underline the potential of PEG, pSar and pHPMA-based carriers in nanomedicine.",

            "text": "Additionally, the corona formation around the liposomes was visualized 44 with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, see Figure 5C). The spherical liposome structure was preserved during the centrifugation process, which is not universally valid for all liposomes. The liposomes were comparably stable because of the high amount of Chol that was incorporated into the lipid membrane. When zoomed in on the sample, even parts of the protein corona itself could be observed as indicated by the red arrows. \n\nAs the protein coronas were quite similar for all liposome samples, with only L-hbPG showing slight deviations with regard to their corona composition, the influence of the different surface functionalizations on the cellular uptake by macrophages (RAW264.7) was investigated. A decreased uptake of a nanocarrier by macrophages is known to lead to reduced clearance by the immune system and, therefore, to a potentially longer blood circulation time with a correspondingly higher probability for the nanocarrier to reach its target location in the body. 45,46 n Figure 6A, the cell uptake results obtained from flow cytometry measurements after 2 and 24 h of incubation for all liposome samples (7.5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) are represented. For the formation of the protein corona, different plasma concentrations (0, 5, and 100%) were chosen to detect any concentration dependency, as observed by Monopoli et al. for different systems. 47 Interestingly, when first comparing the liposome uptake behavior with and without protein corona, there was no significant change visible. After 2 h incubation time, the number of positive cells was generally very low (<10%). Liposomes functionalized with PEG chains (L-PEG) showed an even lower cellular uptake than the other two samples, even though their protein corona composition only differed very slightly from the unfunctionalized liposomes (Lun). This reduced cellular uptake of L-PEG could be caused by an inhibition of the scavenger receptor-mediated cellular uptake. These scavenger receptors can be found on macrophages and were reported to recognize PEG, especially in combination with albumin. 48,49",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are prone to interact with a myriad of biomolecules present in the bloodstream when delivered in vivo. This process usually generates two layers of proteins that are adsorbed onto the NPs' surface, namely hard and soft corona. The analysis and isolation of such adsorbed proteins have revealed that corona composition may change over time until reaching an equilibrium state [60] and is mainly composed of abundant proteins such as albumin and other less abundant ones that tend to interact selectively with the NPs' surface [41,61]. Interestingly, the presence of this corona layer may produce significant changes in their biological activity affecting the long-term fate of NPs. Consequently, a full understanding of the effect of such corona on the stability of NPs is essential for the appropriate design of nanotherapeutics. The formation of PC NPs between polymeric NPs (e.g., PLGA and PLGA-PEG) with plasma proteins (FBS), their biophysical characterization, and isolation have been reported [60,[62][63][64][65][66]. In these studies, NPs were mainly prepared via solvent emulsification-diffusion methods [66] using PVA as a stabilizer together with the use of high-energy methods (e.g., ultracentrifugation or high-speed homogenizer). \n\nThe adsorption process of serum proteins, as well as other kind of model proteins onto the surface of PLGA NPs prepared by nano-emulsion templates and low-energy methods, have been recently reported. These studies evaluated the colloidal stabilities of such PC NPs in the presence of different serum concentrations [64,65] as well the formation, isolation, and analysis of proteins adsorbed on the surface of different functionalized polymeric NPs using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) [41,62,63,66].",

            "text": "Noteworthy, such a revolutionary principle was demonstrated by studying PEG-modified nanoparticles [36]. Indeed, the concept of controlling the phenomenon of protein corona formation by designing novel and specific nanoparticle surfaces is progressively replacing the illusion of zeroing macromolecular adsorption [37]. Thus, elucidating the molecular interactions at the nano-bio interface will be crucial for predicting protein corona formation and composition of designed nano-vectors characterized by high biocompatibility and specific targeting functions [38,39]. \n\nAn ideal protein corona should act as camouflage, promoting nanoparticle recognition as \"self\" by the organism and, at the same time, acting as a chaperone, promoting the crossing of biological barriers (Figure 1). In this view, the merging of research from different fields of science is becoming increasingly urgent in order to bridge in vitro technologies with in vivo biomedicine. Moreover, synthetic biology will benefit from the comprehension of interactions occurring between biomolecules (biotic) and materials (abiotic) at the molecular level [40]. In this context, the concept of \"epitope map,\" proposed by Dawson and colleagues about twenty years ago [41], aimed at mapping the actual surface of the protein corona, ideally encompassing both protein composition and conformation. The epitope map is seen as the \"biological fingerprint\" of the particle-protein complex and defines its biological activity. Thus, the outer layer of the biomolecular envelop controls the interaction of the nanoparticles with cells and the nanoparticles trafficking to different cell compartments. Hence, this biological \"mask\" determines the fate of synthetic nanoparticles in biological systems. In the schematic representation, upon exposure to a biological milieu, most of the nanoparticles reported in the literature (yellow) are subjected to the unspecific binding of proteins (red). On the contrary, nanoparticles displaying binding selectivity (grey) lead to the formation of a shell composed of specific proteins (blue) promoting cell internalization. This biological envelope makes the difference between nanoparticles being internalized or being cleared by the immune system. Arrows represent the Vroman effect.",

            "text": "cells' interaction with the PEGylated surface. In general, PEGylation has been shown to improve the stability, circulation lifetime, and consequently the therapeutic effect of several nanosystems (e.g., micelles, liposomes, and gold nanoparticles, among others). [59][60][61][62] Once in solution, each ethylene glycol subunit is surrounded by at least 2-3 water molecules which render a large hydration shell that sterically prevents the interaction and penetration of biological compounds into the polymer layer. The water molecules near PEG terminal groups are also crucial for limiting protein adsorption, where a large number of tightly bound water molecules around the terminal groups of PEG induce a strong repulsive force. [63] Additionally, PEG presents high flexibility, mobility, and conformation that make the displacement of PEG chains by biointeractions thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, PEG acts as a shield improving the in vivo stability of nanoparticles, preventing the nanoparticles' aggregation and interaction with blood components, reducing the clearance rate, and consequently prolonging nanosystems' blood circulation time. [64] However, many parameters can influence the interactions and circulation time of PEGylated nanoparticles, such as PEG molecular weight (Mw), density at the nanoparticle surface, and chain architecture. Different studies revealed that increasing the PEG Mw leads to higher in vivo circulation times, mainly by reducing nanoparticles' aggregation and formation of the protein corona. [60,61,[65][66][67] Despite these advantages, some drawbacks have been limiting the translation of the PEGylated nanomaterials to the clinic. Several studies demonstrated that multiple administrations can stimulate anti-PEG antibody responses and accelerate the opsonization and clearance of PEGylated nanosystemsa phenomenon denominated by accelerated blood clearance (ABC). [68] In fact, animals and humans that receive repeated doses of PEGylated therapeutics often generate potent IgM antibody responses to PEG, which causes a rapid elimination (minutes to a few hours) of the subsequent doses of PEGylated systems.

With dynamic light scattering, it is possible to directly monitor the aggregation state of nanocarriers in concentrated blood plasma. 69,70  his method is suitable for screening the behavior of nanocarriers in blood plasma prior to in vivo investigations. The SiO 2 NCs stabilized by cationic surfactant CTMA-Cl formed macroscopic aggregates in concentrated plasma. However, aggregation formation was significantly reduced after PEGylation of the NCs with the PEGbased nonionic surfactant Lutensol AT50 (Figure 6). Surface charge of the NCs was reduced from +12 mV to ~ 0 mV due to the removal of cationic surfactant (Figure 2). With increased density of PEG chains on the surface, the SiO 2 NCs became more stable in PBS and in blood plasma (Figure S3). Especially, going from 0.64 to 0.96 PEG chains / nm\u00b2 resulted in a major stability improvement, suggesting a certain threshold of required surface PEG density. While some aggregates of SiO 2 NCs in blood plasma could still be observed after PEGylation, the intensity contribution factor of these larger species suggest that their actual concentration is very low compared to stable NCs (Figure S3b). The exemplary autocorrelation functions of the corresponding measured samples are given in Figure S4.

            "text": "For several decades, surface grafted polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been a go-to strategy for preserving the synthetic identity of liposomes in physiological milieu and preventing clearance by immune cells. However, the limited clinical translation of PEGylated liposomes is mainly due to the protein corona formation and the subsequent modification of liposomes\u2019 synthetic identity, which affects their interactions with immune cells and blood residency. Here we exploit the electric charge of DNA to generate unPEGylated liposome/DNA complexes that, upon exposure to human plasma, gets covered with an opsonin-deficient protein corona. The final product of the synthetic process is a biomimetic nanoparticle type covered by a proteonucleotidic corona, or \u201cproteoDNAsome\u201d, which maintains its synthetic identity in vivo and is able to slip past the immune system more efficiently than PEGylated liposomes. Accumulation of proteoDNAsomes in the spleen and the liver was lower than that of PEGylated systems. Our work highlights the importance of generating stable biomolecular coronas in the development of stealth unPEGylated particles, thus providing a connection between the biological behavior of particles in vivo and their synthetic identity.",

            "text": "The significance of protein coronas on the biological fates of nanoparticles has been widely recognized. Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated. The ligand-protein corona composition-immune response coefficient analysis may serve next-generation nanomedicines with high-efficiency and good-safety for better clinical translation.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles in nanomedicine can help us understand the underlying mechanisms involved in CAD development. One useful aspect of in vivo application of nanoparticles is the formation of the biomolecular/protein corona (i.e., a layer of biomolecules which covers the surface of nanoparticles upon their interactions with biological fluids [228][229][230]). In 2014, we found that the protein corona profiles of patients with different diseases were substantially different despite the conventional plasma analysis showing negligible variations [231]. This effect is referred to as the \"disease-specific protein corona\" [232], which has been replicated elsewhere [233][234][235] and used for early detection of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases [236]. We recently revealed that the sensitivity, specificity, and prediction accuracy of disease detection of protein corona are enhanced by using nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties (i.e., called a protein corona sensor array technology) [237]. Another potential approach to better analyze plasma proteins and get useful information regarding CAD development could be magnetic levitation (MagLev). We have recently levitated plasma proteins using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and revealed that the levitated plasma proteins create ellipsoidal patterns [238]. Using machine learning and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy approaches, we then demonstrated that the patterns of the levitated plasma proteins contain useful information regarding the health spectrum of plasma donors [239]. This strategy can be very helpful and feasible for monitoring the interactions between gut microbiota patterns and CAD. Using advanced data analysis, one can define the protein/biomolecular patterns with strong associations to the variations of gut microbiota profiles and the occurrence and/or progression of CAD [240]. The knowledge about the role of important biomolecular variations may provide a valuable opportunity not only for the early detection of CAD based on the specific gut microbiota patterns (which in turn affect Fig. 5 Nanomedicine, microbiota, and CAD. Nanoparticles in nanomedicine have many applications that can aid in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CAD.",

            "text": "When the graft density was higher, the PEG chains were confined by their interaction with neighboring polymers, and did not cause the same kinetic effect. Nevertheless, a high grafting density provided strong steric repulsion, needed to achieve low binding of fetal bovine serum. Therefore, the dual-layer design seemed to maximize both effects by combining a dense inner (primary) PEG layer (preventing proteins from being adsorbed by nanoparticles via steric repulsion) with an outer layer of PEG in the mushroom to brush regime (slowed down the adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles by harnessing the conformational fluctuation between topographical conformations of the PEG ligands) [49]. \n\nFollowing a different approach, the PEG shell was crosslinked to form a more rigid structure, which led to more inert surfaces. As such, a series of Au nanoparticles carrying a crosslinked PEG shell were developed (Figure 7). The crosslinked PEG shells were formed on the Au nanoparticle cores through in situ polymerization, which led to a higher capability to resist protein corona formation than their linear counterparts without cross-linking. The average quantity of proteins adsorbed per crosslinked nanoparticle was in the range of 2.993 \u00d7 10 6 Da, which was almost half of the quantity of proteins adsorbed by non-crosslinked PEGylated analogue nanoparticles (5.723 \u00d7 10 6 , 4.743 \u00d7 10 6 , and 5.251 \u00d7 10 6 Da, respectively for Au nanoparticles carrying PEG-NH 2 , PEG-OCH 3 , or PEG-C=C). Furthermore, by crosslinking the PEG shell, the particles obtained a high chemical stability in harsh conditions or biologically relevant media. Remarkably, these particles demonstrated an enhanced stealth effect and colloidal stability under different environments when compared with non-crosslinked analogues [50]. In addition to the success demonstrated by the crosslinking of the PEG shell, a few groups have recently started to look at the possibility of controlling protein adsorption in surfaces by altering the morphology or topology of the polymers used.",

It was also reported that hydrophilic particles dramatically reduce the complement activation level (Shreffler et al., 2019), and that the protein corona affects the plasmatic half-time (Bertrand et al., 2017), cell uptake and biodistribution (Chinen et al., 2017), oxidative stress (Jayaram et al., 2017), toxicity (Corbo et al., 2016) and host immune response (Lee et al., 2015) of nanoparticles. This causes a consequent modulation of their in vivo behavior and pharmacological outcome. \n\nIn this context, Behzadi et al. investigated the potential effect of the biological environment on the release profile of drugs encapsulated in different types of polymeric nanoparticles, demonstrating that the leakage of the active compounds was decreased when the particle surface was decorated with the protein corona (Behzadi et al., 2014). These data demonstrate that the release profile of the entrapped compounds should be properly investigated following the formation of a protein coating in order to predict a real in vivo fate of the formulation. Another recent study performed by Alberg et al. evaluated the influence of the protein corona on the physico-chemical properties of three polymeric nanoparticles characterized by long-circulation properties as a consequence of the surface decoration with poly(N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide) (PHPMA), polysarcosine (pSar), and PEG (Alberg et al., 2020). They showed that the mean sizes of the nanosystems was not increased after incubation with human plasma and only a negligible amount of proteins was adsorbed onto the polymeric nanocarriers. This suggests that an intensive corona formation is not a general property of nanoparticles. These results are in contrast with those reported in other investigations (Kokkinopoulou et al., 2017;Weber et al., 2018).",

As we observed a highly significant difference for the in vitro situation compared to the in vivo situation, we aimed for a strategy, which reflects the in vivo corona proteom. We developed an approach, which we termed ex vivo. Blood was freshly isolated from mice, transferred into heparin containing tubes and nanoparticles were directly incubated with this whole blood for 1 min. The ex vivo corona was purified in analogy to the in vivo or in vitro corona. The heat map reflecting the 20 most abundant corona proteins highlights that the ex vivo corona is highly comparable to the in vivo corona. In strong contrast to these are the patterns for the in vitro corona. This indicated that the ex vivo approach reflects the in vivo situation to the greatest extent (Figures 3B and S5). \n\nThe ultimate test for the influence of the protein corona is the demonstration that the adsorbed proteins change the cellular interaction of nanoparticles. As shown in a number of reports, due to corona formation, the cellular interactions of nanoparticles are strongly altered [40,41]. Therefore, we wanted to study the cellular interaction of nanoparticles coated with the in vitro corona compared to the ex vivo or in vivo corona (Figure 4). Cellular association towards the mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7, DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, Germany) was analysed by flow cytometry. \n\nAlready for the four in vitro incubated nanoparticles, we saw significant difference in the cellular interaction.

            "text": "Targeted drug delivery using nanoparticles can minimize the side effects of conventional pharmaceutical antibacterial agents and increase their effectiveness. However, the introduction of nanoparticle-based antibacterial agents into clinical use still remains a challenge, due to difficulties in regulating interactions at interfaces between nanoparticles and biological systems [124]. \n\nWhen creating antibacterial nanosystems and nanocomposites, it is necessary to take into account that nanomaterials in biological media interact with all occurring biomolecules and form a protein \"biocorona\". The biocorona is a very dynamic structure, and its composition changes over time. Biocorona generation affects the effectiveness of the nanopreparation, the \"accuracy\" of targeted delivery, and it also directs the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Understanding the process of corona formation is critical to predicting the behavior of NPs in biological systems, including nanotoxicology applications and the development of drug delivery platforms at the nanoscale. \n\nThe formation of a protein crown should depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of both NPs and their biological environment [125]. \"Corona\" formation can be influenced by the nanoparticles used by varying such factors as their constituent components, size, presence of functional groups, coatings, charge, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, etc. [126,127]. \n\nFor unwanted protein uptake, mechanisms can be introduced to prevent or control the composition of the protein corona. One of these mechanisms is to give the NP surface certain functions by including various chemical groups that \"hide\" it from the \"view\" of immune cells [128]. A second similar mechanism would be the coating of the NP surface with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEGylation), in order to prevent recognition of the NP by the reticuloendothelial system. \n\nHowever, the protein crown should not always be seen as an artifact to be avoided. In the case of carbohydrate-decorated amphiphilic nanoparticles, a protein crown is formed in the biological environment based mainly on human serum albumin, complement proteins, apolipoproteins, and proteins involved in the coagulation cascade.",

            "text": "We present a workflow that combines in situ optical analysis of the protein corona by MP-SPR coupled with sensitive nLC-MS/ MS analysis of the hard and soft corona subsections. The synthesis of a reusable pTHMMAA-BDA-biosensor for liposome capture and reduced sensor protein binding is presented. For proof-of-concept, corona formation on regular liposomes and light-triggered liposomes was studied under dynamic conditions in 100% human plasma, revealing significant formulation-dependent differences in the structure and composition of both corona subsections. Separate clusters for HC and SC suggest differences in the ensuing biological responses for these corona subtypes. The clinically-optimized formulation covered with PEG-ICG clusters (F2) formed a distinct SC signature; it contained proteins reported to mediate nanoparticle stealth properties, previously reported only in the HC. This highlights the importance of complementary soft corona characterization to obtain a holistic picture of the acquired biological identity. The relative enrichment of stealth-mediating proteins on all liposome surfaces suggests that lipids alone may induce their selective accumulation in the corona regardless of pegylation. Pegylated surfaces accumulated more molecules on their surfaces and formed thicker coronas, overperformed by the repellent properties of phosphatidylcholine groups on bare liposomes, but this \"harvesting\" may be necessary for the stealth effect mediated by hydrophilic coatings. While surface mass densities were similar for the corona subsections, thickness and protein-to-lipid values clearly discerned between the different formulations. Combined, both the physical structures and the proteomic compositions of the coronas were modulated by the surface coating of the liposome and the constituent lipid composition. Notably, this is the first time that truly complementary proteomic compositions for a hard and soft corona have been reported along with non-invasively obtained in situ physical parameters in one experiment. By facilitating studies on tailored, personalized, and artificial coronas with liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, the workflow has potential to advance nanomedical development and clinical translation especially in the field of drug delivery.",

            "title": "Disentangling Biomolecular Corona Interactions With Cell Receptors and Implications for Targeting of Nanomedicines",
            "text": "To achieve ideal nanomedicine design with better targeting efficiency, it is of great importance to first understand the interactions between nano-sized materials and living organisms at the cellular and molecular levels. In the presence of a biological fluid, nanoparticles are covered by a bimolecular corona which could potentially determine many of those interactions. It is now widely acknowledged that many key processes are driven by initial recognition of this adsorbed layer by cell receptors. Thus, the corona can affect receptor-mediated outcomes such as nanoparticle targeting, biodistribution, ability to cross biological barriers, and intracellular trafficking. The latest findings on the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors discussed in this review provide a deeper understanding of the complexity of this very first step in nanoparticle-cell interactions and its implications for the following outcomes at cell level. All these recent works showed that a combination of the knowledge of biomolecular corona composition, how these components are organized and presented, and which and how many receptors interact with this adsorbed layer are all critical aspects to be considered when designing targeted drug carriers. Thus, with the benefits and limitations offered by the discussed methods, better insights could be achieved by, for instance, combining some of them on the same system. At the same time, the biomolecular corona itself can be used as a tool to discover potential ligands as well as receptors involved in nanoparticle uptake in specific cell types to be used for novel targeting strategies (Walkey et al., 2014;Liu et al., 2015;Ritz et al., 2015;Yin et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2020). Indeed, many more aspects are yet still to be disentangled, for instance, how other physiological factors such as flow and shear stress (in blood) influence not only the biomolecular corona composition, but also the resulting interactions with cell receptors. To this end, systematic and reproducible tools must be developed that include a more physiological platform to mimic in vivo conditions, while allowing a comprehensive characterization of the biomolecular corona, and investigation of the corresponding biological interactions. We believe that further developments in this direction will help to provide valuable insights and opportunities for accelerating the bench-to bed translation of nanomedicine.",

            "text": "STRATEGIES FOR APPLICATION Though great progress has been made in size-tunable nanoparticles, there are still many challenges that hinder the efficacy, which need to be further optimized and solved. \n\n5.1. Protein Corona May Shield the Responsive Ligand. Protein corona acts as the main issue to affect the targeting efficiency. The corona is quickly formed once nanoparticles are introduced into biological fluid. As we have discussed previously, the composition, size, shape, and surface chemistry of nanoparticles, and even the different fluid environment in vivo, influence the formation of protein corona. 152 In addition to acting as opsonin to mark a nanodrug and alter its biodistribution, the adsorbed protein corona on the surface may also shield the responsive ligand from stimuli and affect the sensitivity of size changing. Among which, the mechanism that need direct contact such as enzymatic reaction, pH-induced protonation and GSH-dependent redox may suffer from the protein corona a lot, while the external stimuli such as light and temperature would not be bothered. Though PEGylation has been confirmed to facilitate nanoparticles with the \"stealth\" property, which can reduce the protein adsorption and decrease the effect of corona, there comes a new question whether the enzymatic reaction would also be affected by PEGylation, as the nature of enzyme is protein as well. The response sensitivity may be affected in the enzyme-induced size change after PEGylation. \n\n5.2. Accuracy of Measurement. As we are doing research studies about size changing, the detection of nanoparticles' size undoubtably requires very high accuracy. However, the size measured by DLS always displays a relatively wide peak. 153 anoparticles with an average DLS size of 100 nm probably have a peak ranging from 50 to 400 nm. It is not that convincing to confirm the success of size shrinkage (from 100 to 50 nm) or size aggregation (from 100 to 400 nm) as there is an overlap of size during the size change process. The corresponding distribution intervals can be compared separately instead of just comparing the average number, which is meaningless.",

            "text": "In agreement with the previous investigation in mice, the in vivo corona was found to show a greater molecular complexity in comparison to its ex vivo counterpart (Hadjidemetriou et al., 2019). Bertrand et al. (2017) performed comprehensive studies using a library of polymeric nanoparticles and different knockout mouse models to examine the role of the in vivo protein adsorption for the clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream. They could show that the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) following intravenous injection of the nanoparticles was dependent on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) density. Hence, while ApoE appeared to rescue nanoparticles with low PEG coverage from rapid clearance, it also seemed to act as a potential ligand for low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) receptor on all nanoparticles irrespective of PEG density (Bertrand et al., 2017). The LDL receptor is normally responsible for receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles decorated with apolipoproteins. Moreover, studies using complement-deficient mice suggested that complement activation cannot be the sole predictor of nanoparticle residency in the bloodstream in mice since the biological fate of both short-circulating and long-circulating nanoparticles was unaffected by the absence of complement protein 3 (C3) (Bertrand et al., 2017). It is noteworthy that patisiran (Onpattro\u2122), a lipid nanoparticle formulation of small interfering RNA for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin (TTR)-mediated amyloidosis, appears to be targeted to hepatocytes through the adsorption of ApoE on the surface of the nanoparticles following i.v. administration (Akinc et al., 2019). Thus, while targeting of nanomedicines may be achieved by the incorporation of specific ligands, it seems that the adsorption of ApoE enables patisiran to exploit the body's own targeting system for lipid-laden particles.",

            "text": "Understanding the factors that influence the diffusion of nanoparticles in biological fluids is of particular importance to drug delivery applications. Nanoparticles change their physical characteristics when exposed to a biological medium due to the instantaneous adsorption 31 of proteins leading to the formation of a protein corona. The speed and quantity of protein adsorption has been linked with the physical characteristics of the nanomaterial such as size, charge and material 32 . The adsorption of proteins to a solid interface is a complex process, depending on relative abundance and affinity of protein molecules and an interaction between several adsorption subprocesses [33][34][35] . This paper does not deal with the different mechanisms of adsorption and qualitative differences in the protein corona, nor does it focus on changes in the nanoparticle physical characteristics. Rather, it presents experimental data demonstrating the influence of protein interactions on diffusion of nanoparticles in a commonly used cell culture media with typical FBS concentrations used in in-vitro testing. With the rise in nanoparticle uses in medicine, several studies have attempted to characterise the protein corona and its consequences on the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles. Surprisingly, there is very little research on the influence of the protein corona on the dynamics of nanoparticles. Recent studies have highlighted the disparity between observed and predicted particle dynamics at the nanoscale making it clear that experimental methods that accurately quantify the diffusion of nanoparticles in biological media are needed and motivated this study. Figure 2 confirms that proteins were present after nanoparticles had been exposed to Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and isolated from the media. The following sections discuss the influence of surface charge, serum concentration and particle size on nanoparticle dynamics in the biological medium.",

            "text": "This low cell interaction is achieved by combining a brush conformation of PEG with low protein affinity of OVA-NCs, which minimizes the overall protein adsorption. OVA-NCs were covalently attached with PEG at varied lengths and densities, resulting in PEG chains with mushroom or brush conformation. The PEG conformation determines protein corona patterns and the abundance of distinct proteins in the corona. PEG chains with a brush conformation lead to increased adsorption of clusterin and decreased serum albumin in the corona. The PEG brush conformation at the low protein adsorbance regime with a clusterin-enriched surface leads to the stealth behavior of nanocarriers with inhibited phagocytic uptake. We establish a clear correlation of PEG conformation with quantitative analysis of adsorbed clusterin and stealth behavior of the resulting nanocarriers. \n\nTo precisely investigate the correlation between PEG conformation, protein corona composition, and cellular uptake, a well-defined system including defined nanocarriers and quantitative PEG modification is essential. We first synthesized OVA-NCs via a polyaddition reaction in a water-in-oil miniemulsion. Amino groups of ovalbumin were reacted with toluene diisocyanate, resulting in core\u2212shell nanocapsules with a hydrodynamic diameter of ca. 250 nm (Figures 1a and S1). OVA-NCs were fluorescently labeled by encapsulating Cy5oligonucleotides for a cellular uptake study. OVA-NCs exhibited very low protein adsorption (<0.5 mg/m 2 ) compared with reported nanoparticles, e.g., \u223c7.7 mg/m 2 for silica nanoparticles 15 and \u223c3.6 mg/m 2 for polystyrene nanoparticles. 1 Therefore, OVA-NCs serve as a suitable system for studying protein interaction with minimized nonspecific protein adsorption. \n\nOVA-NCs were modified with PEG-isocyanate (MeO-PEG-NCO, M w = 2000, 3400, or 5000 g mol \u22121 ) by reacting with the amino groups of OVA.",

            "text": "In vivo, lipid vectors for drug delivery adsorb proteins, lipids and other plasmatic biomolecules on their surface in a non-specific manner once injected: depending on the nanoparticles' properties, such as their charge, hydrophilicity, dimensions and morphology, the several components present in plasma interact and build a coating. The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, the interaction of individual nanoparticles within \u223c200 nm of the membrane were observed with a 50 ms time resolution over timespans of minutes (Fig. 1b-d). Maintaining a simplistic membrane across experiments, we altered the particle and environmental conditions to investigate their effects on non-specific membrane adsorption. We studied the influence of the biomolecular corona, as well as the role of particle size and membrane composition, on these interactions. Additionally, flow conditions were introduced to mimic shear stresses present in the capillary environment in our simplified system. We quantified particle adsorption rates and the distributions of residence times on the membrane. Thereby, it was possible to distinguish the effect of each variable on transient as well as long lived events. The combination of event frequency and duration revealed how the biomolecular corona as well as flow conditions strongly affect non-specific interactions of the nanoparticles with the lipid bilayer.",

We will highlight the parameters influencing the quantity and the identity of the adsorbed proteins. In a second part, we will resume the main findings about the influence of a biomolecular corona on cellular uptake, toxicity, biodistribution and targeting ability. To be noticed is the need for standardized experiments and very precise reports of the protocols and methods used in the experimental sections to extract informative data.

For example, NPs are capable of targeting tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) that have been identi\ue103ed as an essential component of the tumor microenvironment. 69 lthough this \ue103eld of research is still in its infancy and the mechanisms that regulate the interaction between TAMs and cancer cells are not yet fully understood, there is general Fig. 2 Impact of biomolecular corona on the immune response. The BC changes nanoparticles' biological identity triggering activation of the immune system. As most plasma proteins are anionic at physiological pH, the biomolecular corona provides nanoparticles with a negative surface charge that generally reduces association and capture by immune cells. Depending on the chemical identity of nanoparticles the biomolecular corona increases particle size and promotes the formation of clusters of various sizes that can be engulfed by circulating and resident macrophages. Immunogenic serum proteins can activate the complement system leading to the clearance of nanoparticles by phagocytes. Conformational changes in the bound proteins may trigger protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. Immunogenic epitope generation caused by protein denaturation activate cell receptors (e.g., the integrin receptor Mac-1) and stimulate signaling pathway leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines.",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules. The formation of a corona effectively coats the molecules and consequently deactivates the ability of nanoparticles to recognise cell receptors.\n\nThe molecular composition of a corona can also promote binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane and consequently enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. 27 For example, a corona composed of multiple biomolecules (i.e. proteins like prothrombin, antithrombin III, vitronectin, intera-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain H5, platelet factor 4 and apolipoprotein H) promoted cellular uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles in human cervical carcinoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. 27 Corona was also shown to enhance cellular uptake of Janus gold-iron oxide and polystyrene nanoparticles in human vascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 30,31 While the rapid formation of a corona on nanoparticles is known to in\ue104uence their interactions with cells, there is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how",

            "text": "The surface modification provides enough net charges on the Au NPs, which may produce electrostatic attraction to the oppositely charged functional groups in proteins. For example, positively charged PDDAC-gold nanorods (Au NRs) will adsorb more serum proteins than negatively charged PSS-Au NRs based on SDS-PAGE results [79]. \n\nIn addition, serum protein corona bound on the surface of PEG-grafted Au NPs can be characterized by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and more than 70 proteins on the surface have been identified. The amount of protein adsorption depends on the size of the Au NPs and the density of grafted PEG. Specifically, the greater the PEG coating density (molecular weight: 5 kDa), the smaller the amount of adsorbed proteins on the surface [80] (figure 2(a)). Cui et al studied the interaction of different Au NPs (modified by citrate, thioglycolic acid, cysteine, polyethylene glycol (molecular weight: 5 kDa and 2 kDa)) with serum proteins (bovine serum, albumin, transferrin (TRF) and fibrinogen (FIB)). The results showed that there is negligible protein adsorption on the surface of PEG-Au NPs. Fibrinogen can induce NP aggregation when it interacts with other non-PEGcoated Au NPs, while citrate or thioglycolic acid-coated Au NPs are capable of adsorbing TRF and BSA to form a 6-8 nm thickness corona [81]. The molecular weight of PEG ligands on Au NPs also influenced the bound proteins. The authors used PEG with various molecular weights (2, 5, 10, and 20 kDa) to modify 30 nm Au NPs and they found that the amount of adsorbed proteins and kinetics of protein binding are negatively related with the molecular weight of PEG [82].",

            "text": "There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin. Adsorption of opsonin at the nanoparticle surface results in its recognition by mononuclear macrophages, which rapidly clear it from circulation through first-pass metabolism. Adsorption of dysopsonin, on the other hand, has the opposite effect-it prolongs the circulation of a nanoparticle. The formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process and is affected by the affinity of the proteins to nanoparticles, as well as by the protein concentration in a biological medium. The hard corona is the inner layer, irreversibly bound to nanoparticle surface, and exchanges with the physiological medium within a matter of hours. The soft corona is the outer layer, reversibly bound to nanoparticle, and exchanges with the physiological medium on a timescale of seconds to minutes [67]. Since the hard corona remains bound to the surface until the degradation of the nanoparticle, it plays a more profound role than the soft corona in governing the downstream processing of the i.v. administered nanoparticle, such as endocytosis and translocation to different organs. The composition of the protein corona undergoes constant changes in circulation: albumin and fibrinogen, proteins that are abundant in serum, dominate the composition of the protein corona of an i.v. administered nanoparticle for a short period of time. In the long run, relatively scarce proteins with higher affinities and slower kinetics-such as apolipoprotein-may replace them [31]. The total amount of adsorbed protein, however, remains relatively constant [32]. \n\nFormation of a protein corona not only changes the pharmacokinetics, but also the pharmacodynamics of a nanoparticle by affecting its interaction with the various cells and subcellular organelles. As is the case for all foreign substances, nanoparticles are cleared from the bloodstream by cells of the RES. This part of the immune system consists of phagocytes such as monocytes and macrophages, which are mainly located in the liver, spleen, lungs, and lymph nodes.",

            "text": "One of the greatest advantages of PEGylation for biomedical applications is the high solubility in aqueous medium provided by the PEG chains (D'souza and Shegokar, 2016;Knop et al., 2010;Turecek et al., 2016). It has been reported that an ethylene oxide unit can bind two to three water molecules (Branca et al., 2002;Oelmeier et al., 2012;Kolate et al., 2014;Turecek et al., 2016). This solubility creates a \"conformational cloud\", generated by the flexible polymer chains, which hides the charges and provides a steric hindrance, preventing the interaction with other PEGylated NPs, reducing aggregation and providing a high chemical-physical stability (Knop et al., 2010;Gupta et al., 2019). At the same time, the conformational freedom of the PEG chains makes the interaction with other matter thermodynamically unfavourable, decreasing the interactions of the PEGylated products with other biomolecules (Pino et al., 2014;Yang and Lai, 2015;Suk et al., 2016;Fam et al., 2020). In this regard, it has been well established that NPs in contact with the biological environment adsorb biomolecules, such as lipids or proteins, forming the so-called bio-corona. This biomolecular coating dictates the biological \"identity\" of the NPs, affecting their activity, biodistribution and clearance (Cedervall et al., 2007;Nel et al., 2009;Monopoli et al., 2011;Monopoli et al., 2012;Clemente et al., 2022). When these proteins are opsonins, the NPs are recognized by the MPS, and they are eliminated. However, proteins in the corona may also act as dysopsonins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). The MPS is a network of cells descending from monocytes, including tissue-resident macrophages in the liver and spleen, that engulf foreign substances (particles and pathogens).",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

            "text": "Our data coincides with findings reported by Vila et al. and Matesanz et al. [22,23]. They showed that branched PEG-modified GO was 2-6-fold less intensively uptaken by various cell lines (osteoblasts and macrophages) than GO coated with linear PEG. Protein adsorption on the nanoparticles (protein corona) can alter the phagocytosis of nanoparticles. Duan et al. reported lower uptake of GO nanoparticles in the presence of 10% blood serum than in serum-free culture medium [33]. Moreover, it has been shown that certain serum proteins contribute to nanoparticle internalization, in particular that human serum albumin promotes uptake whereas the presence of clusterin in protein corona decreases it [34]. Although we did not study the composition of the GO-PEG protein corona, the GO nanoparticles stabilized with branched PEG showed lower total protein adsorption (Section 3.2.). We suppose that better stealth properties of branched PEG can explain the less intense uptake of GO nanoparticles coated with this type of polymer. \n\nA higher percentage of GO-PEG-positive monocytes at larger GO-PEG concentrations is probably due to the lower number of GO-PEG nanoparticles in cells. Some of the monocytes contain GO-PEG, however the fluorescence of these nanoparticles is not high enough to be detected by the flow cytometer. \n\nThe viability of monocytes was assessed by Trypan Blue staining. The percentage of live cells in control was relatively low (median; 1-99 percentiles: 73.0; 63.0-77.0), which is probably due to the isolation procedure. In general, GO-PEG did not alter the cell viability (p values > 0.999 vs control for all groups in the Friedman test) however we should note that median viability values were slightly lower when 25 \u00b5g/mL of GO-PEG was added (Figure 5). Besides, SnGO at 25 \u00b5g/mL decreased the viability of monocytes obtained from 3 of 4 analyzed individuals to 47-51%.",

With this method, we were able to recover nanoparticles surrounded by the in vivo protein corona without extensive purification steps, which could alter the protein corona profile. We saw that the in vivo protein corona highly differed compared to in vitro incubated nanoparticles, into account the dynamic biodistribution process and interaction with different biological structure and organs. Additionally, we noticed that the chosen anticoagulant should be carefully considered, as we observed significant differences in the corona composition after incubation with serum or plasma supplemented with heparin, EDTA, and citrate. For our here presented ex vivo approach, we demonstrated that the corona composition was comparable to the in vivo situation. Therefore, with this study we aimed to improve the understanding of in vivo corona formation, which is urgently needed in order to reveal the nanoparticles behaviour under physiological conditions.",

Although the fast elimination of the contrast agent is typically desirable in clinical practice to minimize possible adverse effects, prolonged particle circulation might be advantageous for imaging organs or structures requiring longer exposure for the entrapment of the contrast agent. MRI of Fe 3 o 4 @PEG-Ner nanoparticles in tumor bearing mice. Finally, the Fe 3 O 4 @PEG-Ner-20 nanoparticles with the longest blood circulation time were intravenously injected into mice with an induced subcutaneous tumor, and MRI scans were obtained (Fig. 8). A hypointense signal was observed in the liver 4 h  after particle administration, whereas the signal decrease in the tumor was insignificant. The particles were then administered repeatedly after 24 and 48 h to prolong the blood circulation time and enable retention of the particles by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Although a small but significant signal decrease was observed in the tumor shortly after the second and third administrations (Fig. 9), the nanoparticles were quickly eliminated. No signal change was detected compared to the precontrast examination three days after the injection of the final dose, which indicated low retention of the nanoparticles in the tumor. \n\nCleary, the EPR effect was not observed in our study, which is in agreement with clinical practice, where tumor targeting via EPR has not been proved in humans 57 . This is the reason why intratumoral injections are generally preferred to achieve an accumulation of the particles in a tumor. In addition, the internalization of PEG-coated particles in the cells may be hindered by the nonionogenic nature of PEG and its steric repulsions and antifouling properties 58 . Moreover, biological applications of PEG-modified particles were recently questioned due to enhanced serum protein binding and a significant reduction in drug delivery 59 . Other studies have also reported on the immunogenicity of PEG 60 , which requires the development of innovative coatings and/or targeting moieties for blood delivery systems in the near future.",

After intravenous administration, nanoparticles face multiple obstacles, including opsonization, uptake by macrophages, nonspecific accumulation in organs like the spleen and liver, and challenges in margination dynamics. Additionally, high tissue pressure and cellular barriers such as internalization, endosomal escape, and drug efflux pumps hinder effective targeting and delivery. Adapted from (171, 172). \n\nthe accumulation of nanomedicines in tumors, overcoming the limitations of the EPR effect. After discussing the role of PEGylation and alternative hydrophilic polymers in enhancing circulation time and reducing undesired uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), it is crucial to consider another pivotal factor influencing nanoparticle behavior in the bloodstream: the formation of a protein corona. Upon entering the biological milieu, nanoparticles rapidly associate with various proteins in the serum, forming what is referred to as the protein corona (69). This protein layer significantly influences the biodistribution, cellular uptake, and interactions of nanoparticles with target cells (70). For instance, the presence of a protein corona can either enhance or hinder the targeting of nanoparticles to specific cell populations (71). Understanding and controlling the formation of the protein corona is crucial for optimizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems, especially in precise mitochondrial targeting strategies. By finely tuning the surface characteristics and size of nanoparticles, the composition and structure of the protein corona can be manipulated, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and minimizing non-specific interactions (72,73). This is a pivotal step in advancing mitochondrial-targeted nanotherapeutics and their clinical applications, ensuring higher precision and reduced toxicity in treatments.",

            "text": "As previously commented, when NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona [76]. This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities [31]. Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers [77] showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa [78,79]. At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake), see Figure 5    As the PEG density increases, fewer proteins are adsorbed. The lower panel shows that at low PEG densities, macrophage uptake is efficient and serum-dependent. At high PEG densities, macrophage uptake is driven predominantly by a less efficient serum-independent mechanism. Reproduced from [77] with permission.",

[25] who analyzed miRNA from the corona of magnetic nanoparticles after interaction with urine samples. These authors reported that miRNAs can associate with specific proteins of the corona, which promotes their clearance from the liquid medium. In those studies, it was shown that small RNA molecules associate with Argonaute 2-containing protein complexes, avoiding digestion by RNAses in physiological fluids. It seems likely that this interaction is not specific to this combination of miRNA and proteins, but is a general observation of the interactions between proteins and miRNA as the biomolecular corona is formed. is formed. We also investigated the effect of PEGylation of the nanoparticles on the adsorption of miR-200c, both in the absence and presence of AII + C3c proteins. PEGylation of nanoparticles and other surfaces is well known to reduce or prevent protein adsorption. The results in Table 1 and Figure 4B indicate that PEGylation leads to a significant reduction in the porosity of the MSN-NH2, in turn reducing the amount of the total surface area available for miRNA adsorption and reducing the amount of adsorbed miRNA (p < 0.0001). In addition, PEGylation should reduce miRNA adsorption because of the association of proteins and miRNA. Although adding proteins to the miRNA solution improves miRNA adsorption slightly, the adsorption is still clearly lower than for non-PEGylated nanoparticles (p < 0.00001). \n\nUltimately, any diagnostic test will take place from human serum.

However, excessive surface passivation with PEG can lead to the strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding to target receptors, resulting in reduced potential of targeted delivery. To improve specific cell targeting while reducing the nonspecific protein adsorption, a secondary packaging of the nanoparticles with shorter PEG chains, making the targeting ligands densely stretched out for enhanced molecular recognition is demonstrated. Particularly, we report the tailored surface functionalization of the porous nanoparticles that require the stealth shielding onto the open-pore region. This study shows that, in addition to the surface chemistry, the conformation of the PEG layers controls the cellular interaction of nanoparticles. Since the distance between neighboring PEG chains determines the structural conformation of the grafted PEG molecules, tailored PEG combinations can efficiently resist the adsorption of serum proteins onto the pores by transitioning the conformation of the PEG chains, thus significantly enhance the targeting efficiency (>5-fold). The stretched brush PEG conformation with secondary packaging of shorter PEG chains could be a promising anti-opsonization and active targeting strategy for efficient intracellular delivery of nanoparticles.",

[90]enerally, the mere presence of a certain lipid does not reliably predict enrichment of the theoretically associated serum protein, given that its surface display is a prerequisite.This adds complexity to the translation of findings across different NPs, since not only the components but also their ratios affect their struc-tural organization, [91] and consequently, the corona formation of these particles.Thus, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between NP structure and corona composition is essential.Expanding on this, the presence of certain proteins within the corona does not imply a functional role.Indeed, protein binding to NPs can cause structural alterations of said proteins, rendering them biologically inactive. [92]While it is exceedingly challenging to predict how the protein corona might alter the NPs fate, incremental progress in understanding presents opportunities for novel therapeutic and diagnostic avenues.\n\nThus far, endogenous targeting has proven effective in directing NPs to the liver, spleen, and lungs.To extend the application of this strategy toward additional tissues, further investigations connecting protein corona composition and biodistribution are required.",

            "text": "Currently, the design of anticancer therapeutics is focused on creating new systems with low toxicity, e.g., those based on nanocarriers, enabling targeted delivery and high efficiency of the treatment [1]. Usually, it is assumed that immediately after being introduced into the blood, nanoparticles (NPs) are surrounded by plasma proteins that form a biological coating around the individual NPs, known as the protein corona [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Various characteristics of NPs (their size and shape, surface properties, etc.) have an influence on a formation mechanism of the protein corona [5,7]. In this respect, two categories of proteins can be distinguished: opsonins, which can increase the recognition of the reticuloendothelial system and, as a result, lead to a rapid elimination from the organism, and dysopsonins, which can improve the blood circulation time of NPs [9][10][11]. Therefore, when creating targeted drug delivery systems (DDS), knowledge about the protein-NP interaction mechanism can be crucial. \n\nUp until now, the formation of a protein corona was described for NPs based on polystyrene, gold, silica, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and was frequently used for masking other NPs [3,4,6,12]. Another way to increase the lifetime of NPs in the bloodstream is to create a particle with \"stealth\" properties. The \"stealth\" effect can be described as a phenomenon of preventing the adsorption of proteins onto NPs. It allows for prolonging blood clearance and reduces non-specific cellular uptake [2][3][4]. \n\nThe presence of strong or weak interactions between nanoparticles and proteins determines the possibility of the occurrence and the mechanism of the corona formation. The presence of a corona is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of a nanoparticle as a drug carrier [13].",

            "text": "In this way, it is possible to transform an impairing phenomenon into an ally to improve not only the CS but also the circulation time by stealthing them from the immune and clearance systems, while further modulating their interactions with cells (Cai et al., 2020). For instance, Szekeres et al. studied the effect of human plasma on the CS of IO NPs by monitoring their hydrodynamic size as a function of plasma concentration (0-80% v/v in Tris buffer saline solution). The addition of low concentrations of plasma into non-functionalized (NF) and citrate-coated NPs led to the formation of large aggregates that precipitated out. Nevertheless, at much larger plasma concentrations, CA-NPs did not precipitate out, and their size distribution remained similar to the initial one indicating that they were covered up and stabilized by a biomolecular corona layer (Szekeres et al., 2017). Accordingly, Moya et al. suggested human serum albumin (HSA) as a good candidate to improve the colloidal stability of CA-IO NPs in the human serum, without compromising the NP efficiency as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. In fact, a compact enough protein corona is formed to increase the digestion time with an acid condition (such as lysosomes in cells), a valuable feature since it would avoid the need of re-administration in case the MRI diagnostic must be repeated (Moya et al., 2019). On the other hand, PEG stealth effect could be related not only to the polymer itself but also to a clusterin-rich associated biomolecular corona (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). However, there is no enough evidence yet to categorize clusterin as a dysopsonin, a biomolecule that actively suppresses the capture of NPs from bloodstream by the MPS (Papini et al., 2020).",

As the association process is almost irreversible, the biomolecular corona defines the biological identity of the nanosystem, impacting in vivo characteristics, such as circulation time, biodistribution, uptake kinetics, macrophage recognition, release profile, or targeting [143][144][145]. Thus, when moving from in vitro models to in vivo studies or clinical trials, it may be expected to encounter a weaker delivery efficiency and therapeutic effect of carried nucleic acids. To overcome this issue, Yang et al. [147] have proposed the design of a corona made from cyclic RGDyK peptide-modified bovine serum albumin to be used as a precoat on a redox-responsive chitosan-based nanocarrier for siRNA delivery. The synthesized corona remained steady around the delivery vehicle, improved the system's stability, biocompatibility, and targeting ability, reduced serum proteins adsorption, increased intracellular uptake, facilitated the lysosomal escape while maintaining the redox-sensitive responsiveness of the nanocarrier.",

In addition, the uptake of deglycosylated corona NPs by both M1 and M2 macrophages led to an increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines hIL-1b and hTNF-a compared to the fully glycosylated corona NPs. In a recent example the Penad\u00e9s and Liz-Marzan groups assessed the protective effect of glycan ligands for suppressing protein corona formation on gold nanorods. Lactose functionalised nanorods, GlcNAc functionalised gold NPs and PEG-functionalised nanomaterials showed a similar strongly reduced protein adsorption compared to charged citrate stabilised nanoparticles and rods, which rapidly formed complex protein coronas, highlighting the excellent repellent properties of glycans in protein rich media. 64 A macrophage uptake assay comparing lactose and PEG functionalization showed a rapid uptake of PEGylated gold nanorods while lactose efficiently prevented phagocytosis (Fig. 5). 64 These findings seem to be in line with a recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. showing a stealth protection of PEGylated nanostructures against cellular uptake only in the presence of proteins adsorbed onto the PEG-layer. 75 An analysis of the protein corona of PEGylated nanoparticles after exposure to plasma proteins showed selective adhesion of a high amount of clustering an apolipoprotein that reduced uptake by macrophages by up to 75%. These examples also demonstrate that  certain glycans unlike PEG or other polymers used for the protection of nanomaterials against non-specific protein adsorption do not require a specific protein coating to exert their stealth effect. The in situ formation of gold or silver nanoparticles with polysaccharides as a reduction and/or passivation agent can be regarded as an alternative and particularly green chemistry method for the functionalization of nanoparticles with glycans. 76 To this end, various polysaccharides including starch, chitosan and car",

Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

Since the corona biomolecules can mediate the uptake of nanoparticles through recognition by specific cellular receptors, 8,10,12 it is likely that the free serum proteins in solution might also compete for the same receptors and, in this way, reduce the uptake levels of the corona\u2212 nanoparticle complexes. Indeed, the uptake was higher when the corona\u2212nanoparticle complexes were isolated and the free proteins in solution were removed. Given the very different uptake efficiency, in order to focus solely on the effect of corona composition on the mechanisms of uptake and exclude additional effects due to the interference of the free serum molecules in the process, the following studies were performed using isolated corona\u2212nanoparticle complexes. However, it is interesting to note that even after removal of the excess free  a The corona formed on 300 \u03bcg/mL silica nanoparticles dispersed in 12 and 62 mg/mL human serum (low serum corona, LC, and high serum corona, HC, respectively) was prepared and isolated as described in the Methods. Thus, the corona proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, and their relative abundance over total (% of total) was quantified (see Methods for details). The table shows the relative abundance of the top 15 proteins identified in the two conditions. Figure 2.

            "text": "Both in vitro and in vivo experiments on the effective usage of nanocages (AuNCs) as photothermal therapeutic agents have been published. For instance, Hong and colleagues [209] created NIR-absorbing AuNCs and functionalized them with PEG and the AS1411 aptamer to produce cancer-targeted PTT (AS1411-PEG-AuNCs). They showed that when exposed to NIR light, AS1411-PEG-AuNCs killed malignant cells only. \n\nThe Effect of Surface Modification of the Plasmonic Nanoparticles Nanoparticles' surface parameters, such as charge, hydrophobicity, and functional groups, impact how they interact with proteins in the bloodstream [210]. Upon entering the body, nanoparticles are shortly enveloped by a layer of serum proteins, which might alter their biological identity and behavior [211]. For example, nanoparticles with hydrophobic surfaces or positive charges tend to adsorb more serum proteins due to hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic attraction [212]. This protein corona can potentially impact nanoparticle biodistribution, cellular uptake, and clearance. Surface modification with hydrophilic polymers, for example, PEG, can minimize protein adsorption, resulting in a stealth effect that increases circulation time and reduces immune detection [213]. \n\nSurface changes have an impact on nanoparticles' hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential. Surface modification can considerably increase the hydrodynamic diameter, including the nanoparticle core and any surface-bound molecules or protein corona [214]. For example, including a PEG layer often improves the hydrodynamic diameter. Surface changes can affect the zeta potential, which reflects the surface charge of nanoparticles, allowing for desired interactions with biological systems. A neutral or slightly negative zeta potential can limit nonspecific interactions and aggregation, improving stability in biological fluids [215]. Conversely, strongly positive or negative zeta potentials can encourage aggregation and alter the cellular uptake [216]. Additionally, surface changes can affect phagocytosis, the process by which immune cells engulf and eliminate nanoparticles.",

While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane (Mui et al., 2013). Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis (Mui et al., 2013)(Ambegia et al., 2005)(Akinc et al., 2010).\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer.

Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact (Zhang et al., 2020), studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited (Miao et al., 2020).

The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains.

We discovered that only 27% of the adsorbed proteins examined are functional for binding to their target protein. This is because the corona architecture is not a monolayer, but an assembly of proteins that are bound to each other. We further demonstrated that we can control the binding functionality of a protein by changing the organization of proteins in the assembly.

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies.",

Using high throughput LNP barcoding, we quantified how well LNPs delivered DNA barcodes to endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro, as well as endothelial cells and macrophages isolated from the lung, heart, and bone marrow in vivo. We focused on two fundamental questions in drug delivery. First, does in vitro LNP delivery predict in vivo LNP delivery? By comparing how 281 LNPs delivered barcodes to endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro and in vivo, we found in vitro delivery did not predict in vivo delivery. Second, does LNP delivery change within the microenvironment of a tissue? We quantified how 85 LNPs delivered barcodes to eight splenic cell populations, and found that cell types derived from myeloid progenitors tended to be targeted by similar LNPs, relative to cell types derived from lymphoid progenitors.

These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination (Moghimi et al., 2017). PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016).",

In vivo, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid derivatives are employed to stabilize and prolong the circulation lifetime of nucleic acid-containing particles, and to improve targeting strategies. In this study, we have studied the effects of PEG-lipid analogues, i.e. PEG coupled to either phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or ceramide, on cationic-lipid-DNA complex ('lipoplex') assembly and the mechanism of cationic-lipid-mediated delivery of ODNs in vitro. Inclusion of 10 mol% PEG-PE in ODN lipoplexes inhibited their internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells by more than 70%. The intracellular fraction remained entrapped in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, and no release of ODNs was apparent. Similar observations were made for complexes prepared from liposomes that contained PEG-ceramides. Interestingly, delivery resumed when lipoplexes had been externally coated with PEG-ceramides. In this case, the kinetics of delivery were dependent on the length of the ceramide acyl chain, consistent with a requirement for the PEG-lipid to dissociate from the complex. Moreover, although the chemical nature of the PEG-ceramides distinctly affected the net internalization of the complexes, impediment of delivery was largely related to an inhibitory effect of the PEG-lipid on the release of ODNs from the endosomal compartment. Cryo-electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the PEG-lipids stabilize the lamellar phase of the lipoplexes, while their acyl-chain-length-dependent transfer from the complex enables adaptation of the hexagonal phase. Within the endosomal compartment, this transition appears to be instrumental in causing the dissociation and cytosolic release of the ODNs for their nuclear homing.",

Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection.

Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed.

SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies.",

The present study determined the effects of PEG anchors in PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes on in vitro gene-silencing effects and siRNA biodistribution after intravenous injection. Three types of dialkyl or trialkyl cationic lipids were used in the current study for the preparation of cationic liposomes. Additionally, various PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes that contained PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), PEG-1,2-distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (DSG), PEG-cholesterol (PEG-Chol) and PEG-chondroitin sulfate conjugate (PEG-CS) were prepared. The results revealed that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSPE strongly decreased gene-silencing effects in cells. In contrast, those with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS did not largely decrease gene-silencing effects. However, regardless of the PEG-derivative type, PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes decreased their agglutination with erythrocytes. Furthermore, intravenous injection of PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes markedly decreased the accumulation of siRNA in the lungs, regardless of the type of PEG-derivative. However, non-PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes accumulated mainly in the lungs regardless of the siRNA lipoplex cationic lipid type. The results indicated that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS may improve systemic stability without losing transfection activity by PEGylation."

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.",

An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

When LNPs enter biological fluids like blood serum, they acquire a biomolecular corona of proteins that alters their biological identity and function. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as important delivery systems for various therapeutic agents, including nucleic acids like mRNA and siRNA. These nanocarriers typically consist of a lipid bilayer structure that can encapsulate drugs or genetic material, protecting them from degradation and facilitating cellular uptake. To enhance their circulation time and reduce clearance by the immune system, LNPs are often surface-modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, a process known as PEGylation. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nPEGylation creates a hydrophilic shield around the nanoparticle that helps prevent opsonization (the binding of proteins that mark particles for clearance) and reduces interactions with phagocytic cells. This \"stealth\" property allows LNPs to remain in circulation longer, increasing the chance of reaching their therapeutic targets. The PEG coating acts as a steric barrier, decreasing protein adsorption and aggregation of nanoparticles. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nHowever, when LNPs enter biological fluids such as blood serum, they immediately interact with surrounding biomolecules, primarily proteins, leading to the formation of a layer called the biomolecular corona. This corona consists of proteins and other biomolecules that adsorb onto the nanoparticle surface, creating a new biological identity that determines how cells and tissues recognize and process the nanoparticles. The corona formation is a dynamic process with both fast and slow exchange components, resulting in what are often described as \"hard\" (strongly bound) and \"soft\" (loosely associated) coronas. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe interplay between PEGylation and corona formation is complex and critically important for LNP function. While PEG is intended to prevent protein adsorption, the gradual shedding of PEG chains from LNPs in biological environments can significantly alter the kinetics and composition of the forming biomolecular corona, which in turn affects the nanoparticle's biodistribution, cellular uptake, and overall therapeutic efficacy. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "tldr": "PEG shedding from lipid nanoparticles is driven by the lipid anchor chain length, with shorter chains (C14) dissociating more rapidly than longer chains (C18). This process is accelerated by interactions with serum proteins and affects the subsequent formation of protein corona, which determines nanoparticle fate in biological systems. (9 sources)",
                "text": "\nPEG shedding refers to the gradual dissociation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules from the surface of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) after administration into biological fluids. This process is primarily governed by the hydrophobic interactions between the lipid anchors of PEG-lipids and the nanoparticle core. The rate of PEG dissociation is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, with shorter chains (e.g., C14 PEG-DMG) shedding much faster than longer chains (e.g., C18 PEG-DSG) <Paper corpusId=\"225041706\" paperTitle=\"(Guevara et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies using NMR have quantified these differences, showing that PEG-lipids with C14, C16, and C18 chains exhibit desorption rates of approximately 45%, 1.3%, and 0.2% per hour, respectively <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248180560\" paperTitle=\"(Aslund et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSerum proteins play a crucial role in accelerating PEG shedding. When LNPs encounter blood serum, proteins interact with the nanoparticle surface, facilitating the release of PEG-lipids <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Gallud and colleagues demonstrated that pre-incubation of PEGylated LNPs in fetal bovine serum (FBS) increased their cellular uptake in proportion to both the FBS concentration and incubation time, suggesting that serum proteins enhance PEG dissociation <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which serum proteins stimulate PEG release remains incompletely understood.\n\nThis \"PEG dilemma\" represents a fundamental challenge in nanoparticle design. While PEG coating is essential for maintaining colloidal stability and preventing premature clearance, it also impedes cellular uptake by creating steric hindrance at the cell membrane interface <Paper corpusId=\"230782183\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Controlled PEG shedding offers a solution to this dilemma by providing initial protection followed by enhanced cellular interactions after the PEG layer dissociates. When PEG molecules shed from the LNP surface, the exposed lipid components become accessible for interactions with serum proteins, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona that defines the nanoparticle's biological identity <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"230782183\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe timing of PEG shedding is critical for optimal LNP function. Too rapid shedding may lead to premature opsonization and clearance, while too slow shedding can inhibit cellular uptake at target sites <Paper corpusId=\"253801131\" paperTitle=\"(Molle et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. For this reason, LNP formulations, including those used in mRNA vaccines like Moderna's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, often incorporate PEG-lipids with moderate dissociation rates, such as PEG-DMG (C14), which allows for initial distribution from the injection site followed by enhanced cellular interactions after shedding <Paper corpusId=\"253801131\" paperTitle=\"(Molle et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that PEG shedding is part of a broader \"endogenous targeting\" mechanism. Dilliard and colleagues proposed a three-step process: (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the LNP surface, (2) selective binding of specific proteins to the exposed lipid components, and (3) subsequent interactions between these surface-bound proteins and their receptors on target cells <Paper corpusId=\"248180560\" paperTitle=\"(Aslund et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism explains how the molecular composition of LNPs can be engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood, potentially enabling targeted delivery to non-liver tissues.\n\nThe interplay between PEG shedding and protein corona formation significantly impacts drug release kinetics, especially for hydrophobic drugs with diffusion-based release mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"248180560\" paperTitle=\"(Aslund et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"216523247\" paperTitle=\"(Skoczen et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. As PEG molecules dissociate, they alter the LNP surface properties, creating a dynamic environment that influences subsequent protein adsorption patterns and ultimately determines the nanoparticle's biological fate.",

On the other hand, PEGylation with PEG-lipids with longer anchors can negatively affect the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles by inhibiting their interaction with the plasma membrane of the target cells (Zhu et al., 2017)",
                            "Therefore, the use of PEG-lipids with shorter anchors, such as PEGylated 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-DMG, a C14-based lipid), which are gradually released from the surface of nanoparticles, appears to be an extremely successful approach to achieve high colloidal stability and cargo delivery into target cells (Tam et al., 2013). The reason for this is that the PEG-lipid is embedded into the lipid layer by hydrophobic interactions; hence, spontaneous de-PEGylation is a process that can be partially controlled changing their hydrophobic properties (Zhu et al., 2017)."

                            "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action.\n\nThe shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown."

                            "PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity (Suk et al., 2016). While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane (Mui et al., 2013). Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis (Mui et al., 2013)(Ambegia et al., 2005)(Akinc et al., 2010).\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact (Zhang et al., 2020), studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited (Miao et al., 2020). This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona (Paunovska et al., 2018)(Francia et al., 2020)."

                            "The PEG-lipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEG-coating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment."

                            "The \"PEG dilemma\" has prompted the generation of more sophisticated nanoparticles that can trigger \"PEG shedding\" to overcome the steric interference of PEG at the point of cellular entry. In LNP formulations, the dissociation of the outer PEG layer renders particles vulnerable to opsonization; however, likely increases particle cellular association. Chen et al. showed that substitution of more-rapidly dissociating DMG-PEG; which is included in Moderna's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with longer alkyl tailed DSG-PEG lead to a marked increase in particle circulation times, reduced hepatic uptake and decreased dissociation of other lipid components (Chen et al., 2016). It is possible that shedding of the PEG layer from LNP formulations soon after injection can be beneficial, as PEG enables the LNPs to diffuse away from the injection site, but once shed, enables the LNPs to bind to and be internalized by a range of different cells."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "The pharmacokinetics of nanomedicines are complicated by the unique dispositional characteristics of the drug carrier. Most simplistically, the carrier could be a solubilizing platform that allows administration of a hydrophobic drug. Alternatively, the carrier could be stable and release the drug in a controlled manner, allowing for distribution of the carrier to influence distribution of the encapsulated drug. A third potential dispositional mechanism is carriers that are not stably complexed to the drug, but rather bind the drug in a dynamic equilibrium, similar to the binding of unbound drug to protein; since the nanocarrier has distributional and binding characteristics unlike plasma proteins, the equilibrium binding of drug to a nanocarrier can affect pharmacokinetics in unexpected ways, diverging from classical protein binding paradigms. The recently developed stable isotope tracer ultrafiltration assay (SITUA) for nanomedicine fractionation is uniquely suited for distinguishing and comparing these carrier/drug interactions. Here we present the the encapsulated, unencapsulated, and unbound drug fraction pharmacokinetic profiles in rats for marketed nanomedicines, representing examples of controlled release (doxorubicin liposomes, Doxil; and doxorubicin HCl liposome generic), equilibrium binding (paclitaxel cremophor micelle solution, Taxol generic), and solubilizing (paclitaxel albumin nanoparticle, Abraxane; and paclitaxel polylactic acid micelle, Genexol-PM) nanomedicine formulations. The utility of the SITUA method in differentiating these unique pharmacokinetic profiles and its potential for use in establishing generic nanomedicine bioequivalence are discussed."

The rate of PEG dissociation, determined by lipid anchor chain length, directly influences the timing and composition of protein corona formation, creating a dynamic interface that evolves throughout the nanoparticle's circulation.

                "text": "\nThe formation of a biomolecular corona around lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) is a dynamic process that begins immediately upon exposure to biological fluids and evolves over time. This process is intimately connected to the kinetics of PEG shedding, as the gradual dissociation of PEG molecules from the LNP surface creates opportunities for serum proteins to interact with the exposed lipid components. The temporal relationship between these two processes is critical for understanding LNP behavior in vivo.\n\nPEG shedding occurs at rates that are inversely proportional to the lipid anchor chain length, with C14 (dimyristoyl) PEG-lipids dissociating at approximately 45% per hour, C16 PEG-lipids at 1.3% per hour, and C18 (distearoyl) PEG-lipids at only 0.2% per hour <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This differential shedding rate creates a temporal window during which the nanoparticle surface transitions from a PEG-dominated interface to one increasingly accessible to serum proteins <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46643688\" paperTitle=\"(Wilson et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe kinetics of biomolecular corona formation are significantly influenced by both the rate of PEG shedding and the concentration of serum proteins. Studies have shown that pre-incubation of PEGylated LNPs in fetal bovine serum (FBS) increases their cellular uptake in proportion to both the FBS concentration and incubation time, suggesting that serum proteins actively facilitate PEG dissociation <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This observation highlights the role of serum proteins not only as passive components of the corona but as active participants in the process of PEG shedding.\n\nFor LNPs with rapidly dissociating PEG coatings (C14), the biomolecular corona forms more quickly and tends to include proteins that facilitate cellular uptake, such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which specifically targets hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221122365\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, LNPs with more stable PEG coatings (C18) resist protein adsorption for longer periods, which can inhibit both corona formation and subsequent cellular interactions <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"222167392\" paperTitle=\"(Hattori et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe kinetics of corona formation also follow a multi-phase pattern. Initially, there is a rapid adsorption of abundant serum proteins, which may later be displaced by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the nanoparticle surface\u2014a phenomenon known as the Vroman effect <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">. This leads to the formation of a \"hard\" corona of strongly bound proteins closest to the nanoparticle surface and a more loosely associated \"soft\" corona that exchanges more rapidly with the surrounding medium.\n\nThe precise timing of this exchange is critical for the therapeutic efficacy of LNPs. If PEG shedding occurs too rapidly, the resulting corona may promote premature clearance; if it occurs too slowly, cellular uptake at target sites may be inhibited <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"483292\" paperTitle=\"(Mishra et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. This has led to the concept of \"endogenous targeting,\" where the rate of PEG shedding and subsequent protein adsorption can be engineered to recruit specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, thereby directing the nanoparticle to specific tissues <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, the composition of the biomolecular corona evolves over time, with different serum-to-LNP volume ratios resulting in different protein enrichment patterns <Paper corpusId=\"73476676\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the kinetics of corona formation are not only dependent on the rate of PEG shedding but also on the local concentration of proteins and the specific affinities between these proteins and the exposed LNP surface.\n\nUnderstanding these temporal relationships between PEG shedding and corona formation is essential for designing LNPs with optimal therapeutic properties, as they directly influence the nanoparticle's biodistribution, cellular uptake, and ultimately its therapeutic efficacy.",

                            "The PEG-lipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEG-coating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment."

The most clinically advanced siRNA-containing nanoparticles are polymer-coated supramolecular assemblies of siRNA and lipids (lipid nanoparticles or LNPs), which protect the siRNA from nucleases, modulate pharmacokinetics of the siRNA, and enable selective delivery of siRNA to target cells. Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and delivery of such systems is complicated by the complexity of the dynamic supramolecular assembly as well as by its subsequent interactions with the biological milieu. We have developed an ex vivo method that provides insight into how LNPs behave when contacted with biological fluids. Pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR was used to directly measure the kinetics of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) shedding from siRNA encapsulated LNPs in rat serum. The method represents a molecularly specific, real-time, quantitative, and label-free way to monitor the behavior of a nanoparticle surface coating. We believe that this method has broad implications in gaining mechanistic insights into how nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles behave in biofluids and is versatile enough to be applied to a diversity of systems."

                            "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action.\n\nThe shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown."

A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes (Francia et al., 2020)(Sent\u00ed et al., 2021)",

Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection."

                            "Gene therapy holds great potential for treating almost any disease by gene silencing, protein expression, or gene correction. To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

The present study determined the effects of PEG anchors in PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes on in vitro gene-silencing effects and siRNA biodistribution after intravenous injection. Three types of dialkyl or trialkyl cationic lipids were used in the current study for the preparation of cationic liposomes. Additionally, various PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes that contained PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), PEG-1,2-distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (DSG), PEG-cholesterol (PEG-Chol) and PEG-chondroitin sulfate conjugate (PEG-CS) were prepared. The results revealed that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSPE strongly decreased gene-silencing effects in cells. In contrast, those with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS did not largely decrease gene-silencing effects. However, regardless of the PEG-derivative type, PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes decreased their agglutination with erythrocytes. Furthermore, intravenous injection of PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes markedly decreased the accumulation of siRNA in the lungs, regardless of the type of PEG-derivative. However, non-PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes accumulated mainly in the lungs regardless of the siRNA lipoplex cationic lipid type. The results indicated that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS may improve systemic stability without losing transfection activity by PEGylation."

We determine if polycation-plasmid DNA complexes (polyplexes) exploited for in vitro studies behave similarly to variants more applicable to in vivo use by examining their cellular uptake and trafficking. Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

However, in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media. In this study, we have formulated four types of EnCore nanoparticles (F1 to F4) with a similar composition, but different polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated lipid chain lengths (carbon 14 vs. carbon 18) and molar ratios (6% vs. 3%). These LNPs showed dramatic differences in cellular delivery and transfection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in the absence and presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The presence of proteins inhibited the cellular uptake of C18 (3%) nanoparticles, while it facilitated the cellular uptake of C14 nanoparticles. Among the adsorbed proteins from FBS, apolipoprotein E, but not apolipoprotein A1, affected the cellular uptake of the carbon 14 LNPs. Additionally, surface PEG was one of the determinants for the protein corona amount and composition. Finally, different serum to LNP volume ratios resulted in different protein enrichment patterns. Overall, the results showed a correlation between surface chemistry of LNPs and the protein corona composition suggesting a potential use for targeted delivery."

The corona has been conceptualized as having both a \"hard\" inner layer of strongly bound proteins directly interacting with the nanoparticle surface and a more loosely associated \"soft\" outer layer that exchanges more readily with the surrounding medium.\n\nThe composition of the biomolecular corona is significantly influenced by the PEGylation status of the LNP. When PEG molecules shed from the LNP surface, they create binding sites for specific serum proteins. The rate and extent of this shedding, determined by the lipid anchor chain length, directly impacts which proteins can adsorb to the nanoparticle <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Different serum-to-LNP volume ratios can result in different protein enrichment patterns <Paper corpusId=\"73476676\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This concept of \"endogenous targeting\" involves engineering the molecular composition of LNPs to interact with specific proteins in the blood, which then endow the nanoparticle with a unique biological identity that governs its fate in the body <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe corona formation also impacts the stability and drug release properties of LNPs. Depending on its composition, the corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation <Paper corpusId=\"221122365\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3620700\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The presence of these opsonins typically facilitates recognition and clearance by phagocytic cells <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Here, we investigated the function and structural organization of the protein corona using an immunoassay approach. We discovered that only 27% of the adsorbed proteins examined are functional for binding to their target protein. This is because the corona architecture is not a monolayer, but an assembly of proteins that are bound to each other. We further demonstrated that we can control the binding functionality of a protein by changing the organization of proteins in the assembly. We show that manipulation of the corona protein composition and assembly can influence their interactions with macrophage cells in culture.

This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEG-coating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Gene therapy holds great potential for treating almost any disease by gene silencing, protein expression, or gene correction. To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

                            "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) (Hattori et al., 2020). A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes (Francia et al., 2020)(Sent\u00ed et al., 2021)",
                            "Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes (Hattori et al., 2020). Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection."

However, in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media. In this study, we have formulated four types of EnCore nanoparticles (F1 to F4) with a similar composition, but different polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated lipid chain lengths (carbon 14 vs. carbon 18) and molar ratios (6% vs. 3%). These LNPs showed dramatic differences in cellular delivery and transfection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in the absence and presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The presence of proteins inhibited the cellular uptake of C18 (3%) nanoparticles, while it facilitated the cellular uptake of C14 nanoparticles. Among the adsorbed proteins from FBS, apolipoprotein E, but not apolipoprotein A1, affected the cellular uptake of the carbon 14 LNPs. Additionally, surface PEG was one of the determinants for the protein corona amount and composition. Finally, different serum to LNP volume ratios resulted in different protein enrichment patterns. Overall, the results showed a correlation between surface chemistry of LNPs and the protein corona composition suggesting a potential use for targeted delivery."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

While thousands of chemically distinct lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be synthesized to deliver nucleic acids, studying more than a few LNPs in vivo is challenging. As a result, it is difficult to understand how nanoparticles target these cells in vivo. Using high throughput LNP barcoding, we quantified how well LNPs delivered DNA barcodes to endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro, as well as endothelial cells and macrophages isolated from the lung, heart, and bone marrow in vivo. We focused on two fundamental questions in drug delivery. First, does in vitro LNP delivery predict in vivo LNP delivery? By comparing how 281 LNPs delivered barcodes to endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro and in vivo, we found in vitro delivery did not predict in vivo delivery. Second, does LNP delivery change within the microenvironment of a tissue? We quantified how 85 LNPs delivered barcodes to eight splenic cell populations, and found that cell types derived from myeloid progenitors tended to be targeted by similar LNPs, relative to cell types derived from lymphoid progenitors. These data demonstrate that barcoded LNPs can elucidate fundamental questions about in vivo nanoparticle delivery."

                            "PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity (Suk et al., 2016). While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane (Mui et al., 2013). Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis (Mui et al., 2013)(Ambegia et al., 2005)(Akinc et al., 2010).\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact (Zhang et al., 2020), studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited (Miao et al., 2020). This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona (Paunovska et al., 2018)(Francia et al., 2020)."

                            "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents (Braeckmans et al., 2010)(Shi et al., 2002). \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content (Monopoli et al., 2012)(Neagu et al., 2016). It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity (Monopoli et al., 2012). LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination (Moghimi et al., 2017). PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016)."

                            "ConspectusLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a type of lipid vesicles that possess a homogeneous lipid core. These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization."

LNPs with apolipoprotein-rich coronas demonstrate better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma cells compared to those with vitronectin-rich coronas <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This has led to the concept of \"endogenous targeting,\" where the molecular composition of LNPs is engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and target specific tissues <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPEG shedding and corona formation also impact drug release kinetics, especially for hydrophobic drugs with diffusion-based release mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"248180560\" paperTitle=\"(Aslund et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"216523247\" paperTitle=\"(Skoczen et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. As PEG molecules dissociate, they alter the LNP surface properties, creating a dynamic environment that influences subsequent protein adsorption patterns and ultimately determines the nanoparticle's fate in vivo <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe interaction between PEG shedding and corona formation with the immune system is another important functional consequence. LNPs can interact with opsonins such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and complement proteins, facilitating recognition and clearance by phagocytic cells <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. PEGylation can diminish these interactions, allowing LNPs to escape the macrophage system, but the gradual shedding of PEG can lead to increased immune recognition over time <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"25065840\" paperTitle=\"(Shi et al., 2002)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe timing and extent of PEG shedding can be strategically manipulated to achieve desired functional outcomes. For instance, utilizing PEG-lipids with shorter acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may enhance transfection efficiency due to their ability to gradually diffuse out of LNPs, leading to destabilized particles that release their nucleic acid contents more effectively <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7902913\" paperTitle=\"(Braeckmans et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, LNPs with C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which prevents protein corona formation but could also impede transfection <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnderstanding and controlling the functional consequences of PEG shedding and corona formation represents a frontier in LNP design, where the goal is to leverage these processes rather than simply trying to prevent them. This approach acknowledges that these phenomena are inevitable in biological systems and aims to harness them to enhance therapeutic outcomes <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.",

                            "PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity (Suk et al., 2016). While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane (Mui et al., 2013). Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis (Mui et al., 2013)(Ambegia et al., 2005)(Akinc et al., 2010).\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact (Zhang et al., 2020), studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited (Miao et al., 2020). This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona (Paunovska et al., 2018)(Francia et al., 2020)."

                            "The \"PEG dilemma\" has prompted the generation of more sophisticated nanoparticles that can trigger \"PEG shedding\" to overcome the steric interference of PEG at the point of cellular entry. In LNP formulations, the dissociation of the outer PEG layer renders particles vulnerable to opsonization; however, likely increases particle cellular association. Chen et al. showed that substitution of more-rapidly dissociating DMG-PEG; which is included in Moderna's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, with longer alkyl tailed DSG-PEG lead to a marked increase in particle circulation times, reduced hepatic uptake and decreased dissociation of other lipid components (Chen et al., 2016). It is possible that shedding of the PEG layer from LNP formulations soon after injection can be beneficial, as PEG enables the LNPs to diffuse away from the injection site, but once shed, enables the LNPs to bind to and be internalized by a range of different cells."

The self-assembled hybrid NPs are composed of a lipid-poly(ethylene glycol) (lipid-PEG) shell and a polymer/cationic lipid solid core, wherein the lipid-PEG molecules can gradually dissociate from NP surface in the presence of serum albumin. The de-PEGylation kinetics of a series of different lipid-PEGs is measured with their respective NPs, and the NP performance is comprehensively investigated in vitro and in vivo. This systematic study reveals that the lipophilic tails of lipid-PEG dictate its dissociation rate from NP surface, determining the uptake by tumor cells and macrophages, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and gene silencing efficacy of these hybrid siRNA NPs. Based on our observations, we here propose that lipid-PEGs with long and saturated lipophilic tails might be required for effective siRNA delivery to tumor cells and gene silencing of the lipid-polymer hybrid NPs after systemic administration."

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

                            "Endothelial cells and macrophages play active roles in disease and as a result are important targets for nucleic acid therapies. While thousands of chemically distinct lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be synthesized to deliver nucleic acids, studying more than a few LNPs in vivo is challenging. As a result, it is difficult to understand how nanoparticles target these cells in vivo. Using high throughput LNP barcoding, we quantified how well LNPs delivered DNA barcodes to endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro, as well as endothelial cells and macrophages isolated from the lung, heart, and bone marrow in vivo. We focused on two fundamental questions in drug delivery. First, does in vitro LNP delivery predict in vivo LNP delivery? By comparing how 281 LNPs delivered barcodes to endothelial cells and macrophages in vitro and in vivo, we found in vitro delivery did not predict in vivo delivery. Second, does LNP delivery change within the microenvironment of a tissue? We quantified how 85 LNPs delivered barcodes to eight splenic cell populations, and found that cell types derived from myeloid progenitors tended to be targeted by similar LNPs, relative to cell types derived from lymphoid progenitors. These data demonstrate that barcoded LNPs can elucidate fundamental questions about in vivo nanoparticle delivery."

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "The pharmacokinetics of nanomedicines are complicated by the unique dispositional characteristics of the drug carrier. Most simplistically, the carrier could be a solubilizing platform that allows administration of a hydrophobic drug. Alternatively, the carrier could be stable and release the drug in a controlled manner, allowing for distribution of the carrier to influence distribution of the encapsulated drug. A third potential dispositional mechanism is carriers that are not stably complexed to the drug, but rather bind the drug in a dynamic equilibrium, similar to the binding of unbound drug to protein; since the nanocarrier has distributional and binding characteristics unlike plasma proteins, the equilibrium binding of drug to a nanocarrier can affect pharmacokinetics in unexpected ways, diverging from classical protein binding paradigms. The recently developed stable isotope tracer ultrafiltration assay (SITUA) for nanomedicine fractionation is uniquely suited for distinguishing and comparing these carrier/drug interactions. Here we present the the encapsulated, unencapsulated, and unbound drug fraction pharmacokinetic profiles in rats for marketed nanomedicines, representing examples of controlled release (doxorubicin liposomes, Doxil; and doxorubicin HCl liposome generic), equilibrium binding (paclitaxel cremophor micelle solution, Taxol generic), and solubilizing (paclitaxel albumin nanoparticle, Abraxane; and paclitaxel polylactic acid micelle, Genexol-PM) nanomedicine formulations. The utility of the SITUA method in differentiating these unique pharmacokinetic profiles and its potential for use in establishing generic nanomedicine bioequivalence are discussed."

                            "The PEG-lipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEG-coating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment."

                            "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents (Braeckmans et al., 2010)(Shi et al., 2002). \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content (Monopoli et al., 2012)(Neagu et al., 2016). It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity (Monopoli et al., 2012). LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination (Moghimi et al., 2017). PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016)."

                            "Cationic liposomes are applied to transfer oligonucleotides (ODNs) into cells to regulate gene expression for gene therapeutic or cell biological purposes. In vivo, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid derivatives are employed to stabilize and prolong the circulation lifetime of nucleic acid-containing particles, and to improve targeting strategies. In this study, we have studied the effects of PEG-lipid analogues, i.e. PEG coupled to either phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or ceramide, on cationic-lipid-DNA complex ('lipoplex') assembly and the mechanism of cationic-lipid-mediated delivery of ODNs in vitro. Inclusion of 10 mol% PEG-PE in ODN lipoplexes inhibited their internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells by more than 70%. The intracellular fraction remained entrapped in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, and no release of ODNs was apparent. Similar observations were made for complexes prepared from liposomes that contained PEG-ceramides. Interestingly, delivery resumed when lipoplexes had been externally coated with PEG-ceramides. In this case, the kinetics of delivery were dependent on the length of the ceramide acyl chain, consistent with a requirement for the PEG-lipid to dissociate from the complex. Moreover, although the chemical nature of the PEG-ceramides distinctly affected the net internalization of the complexes, impediment of delivery was largely related to an inhibitory effect of the PEG-lipid on the release of ODNs from the endosomal compartment. Cryo-electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the PEG-lipids stabilize the lamellar phase of the lipoplexes, while their acyl-chain-length-dependent transfer from the complex enables adaptation of the hexagonal phase. Within the endosomal compartment, this transition appears to be instrumental in causing the dissociation and cytosolic release of the ODNs for their nuclear homing."

                            "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) (Hattori et al., 2020). A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes (Francia et al., 2020)(Sent\u00ed et al., 2021)",
                            "Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes (Hattori et al., 2020). Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection."
