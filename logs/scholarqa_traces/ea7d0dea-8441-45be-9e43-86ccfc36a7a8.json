            "abstract": "Simple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.",

                    "text": "The crucial steps in the NGS-guided antibody discovery are the fragment generation and library preparation. In our experience, the excision of variable fragments of interest by restriction enzymes (if useful sites are available) has to be preferred over PCR to avoid the loss of relative representativeness of clones and the potential polymerase errors that could generate artefactual sequences [61]. Indeed, although increasing the coverage allows to easily identify co-sequencing errors, the recognition of pre-sequencing polymerase errors that occurred during library preparation is a challenging task [63]. In addition, identification of truncated clones (bearing only VH, or VH with part of VL) has been reported in many studies, presumably due to their biological advantage (discussed in the next sections). To exclude these 'contaminant' clones from analysis, the introduction of a double step of enzymatic restriction to pull out VHs of interest only from full-length scFvs for fragment library preparation, is actually a routinely adopted, suitable option (Figure 2) [33,47]. As an alternative to enzymatic excision, a few nested ultra-high-fidelity PCR cycles can be implemented [57]. \n\nIn recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65].",

                    "text": "Many studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

                    "text": "Simple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.",

Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.",

                    "text": "Beyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.",

Sasso\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.\n## Introduction\nBeyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.\n\n## Implementation of Next Generation Sequencing to Phage Display scFv Library Screening\nIn addition, clone enrichment can also reflect features not necessarily related to target affinity, including biological fitness and binding to non-target substrates (discussed in the next sections) reducing the isolation of true binders [52]. \n\nThe application of NGS to antibody display technologies (such as phage display, E. coli display, yeast display, ribosome display) allows us to deeply characterize the library composition, exploiting the physical linkage between phenotype (peptide or scFv protein) and genotype (coding sequence) of each phage genome present in the phage pool (Figure 2) [53,54]. Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.\n\n## Sequencing-Guided Antibody Discovery: State-of-the-Art and Beyond\nThe crucial steps in the NGS-guided antibody discovery are the fragment generation and library preparation. In our experience, the excision of variable fragments of interest by restriction enzymes (if useful sites are available) has to be preferred over PCR to avoid the loss of relative representativeness of clones and the potential polymerase errors that could generate artefactual sequences [61]. Indeed, although increasing the coverage allows to easily identify co-sequencing errors, the recognition of pre-sequencing polymerase errors that occurred during library preparation is a challenging task [63]. In addition, identification of truncated clones (bearing only VH, or VH with part of VL) has been reported in many studies, presumably due to their biological advantage (discussed in the next sections). To exclude these 'contaminant' clones from analysis, the introduction of a double step of enzymatic restriction to pull out VHs of interest only from full-length scFvs for fragment library preparation, is actually a routinely adopted, suitable option (Figure 2) [33,47]. As an alternative to enzymatic excision, a few nested ultra-high-fidelity PCR cycles can be implemented [57]. \n\nIn recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65].\n...\nThese technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65]. The implementation of long accurate reads and the recent introduction of sample multiplexing by barcoding renders the third-generation sequencing platforms very useful to obtain quantitative information of full-length antibody fragments (scFv, Fab) from library screenings. To date, these technologies are still very rarely applied to the screening of antibody libraries, but the recent improvements and a more widespread availability of instruments are paving the way to their more diffused application (Figure 2) [66][67][68].\n\n## Conclusions\nMany studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries  were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine. \n\nAs the yield of full-length paired antibody data continues to increase, it is crucial for computational tools to keep pace and provide solutions for large-scale comprehensive characterization of scFvs. Seq2scFv addresses the challenges of characterizing both V-domains in a single read, by combining existing tools for the analysis of single domains (IgBLAST and AntPack) with custom scripts specifically developed to delimit and validate scFvs. Seq2scFv identified, characterized and validated 17,479 scFvs (representing 14,764 unique scFvs). The results, compiled in a single table, encapsulate the extensive characterization of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a wide array of attributes across several categories. This includes identifiers (such as amino acid and nucleotide SEGUIDs), sequence information (paired VH-VL sequences, scFv and linker start and end positions, translation frames, linker annotations), linker sequence evaluation, quality flags (indicating the validity and productivity of the sequences), and specific annotations for heavy and light chains (covering gene loci, stop codons, frameshifts, and germline alignments).",

Although such data is not yet publicly available, future benchmarks may become possible as interest in the field grows, leading to more datasets and potentially demonstrating the broader applicability of Seq2scFv across diverse experimental setups. Lastly, the standalone functionality of Seq2scFv provides researchers with the reassurance of data security and privacy, eliminating the need to share sequences online and mitigating potential intellectual property issues. With its emphasis on rapid processing, robust analysis, and comprehensive annotation, we anticipate that Seq2scFv will accelerate the identification and characterization of lead antibody candidates with enhanced efficiency and accuracy.",

                    "text": "Seq2scFv's encoding of sequences also offers a useful solution for future inter-study comparisons. Input reads, nucleotide and amino acid scFvs, are all encoded with a SEGUID, which enables the efficient comparison and identification of identical sequences across panning rounds within the same experiment, or even across different experiments, databases and platforms. Overall, it is a robust feature for tracking and managing antibody data processed with Seq2scFv. \n\nApart from evaluating annotated scFvs, it is also of great interest to evaluate preprocessing statistics to consider the overall experiment quality. The preprocessing statistics acquired prior to Seq2scFv analyses highlight the number of reads discarded at various filtering stages, including quality, adapter removal, and size filtering, enabling researchers to assess the accurate construction of the libraries. Additionally, by examining read length distributions, researchers can identify sequences at unexpected lengths, uncovering potential issues during library preparation, amplification, or the presence of adapter sequences. Moreover, detecting an increase in the frequency of specific length intervals in later panning rounds implies an effective reduction in antibody diversity and a potential enhancement in specificity as selection progresses, validating the panning process. Sharing feedback with the laboratory based on these observations can enhance experimental practices and improve data quality in subsequent experiments. \n\nIn conclusion, Seq2scFv stands as a versatile and accessible toolkit for the analysis of full-length scFvs sequences obtained through long-read sequencing methods. Its open-source nature, free for academic use but subject to a commercial license for commercial purposes, ensures widespread accessibility while addressing proprietary concerns. Notably, the flexibility inherent in Seq2scFv tools enables researchers to customize key parameters such as germline gene databases, numbering schemes, and quality thresholds, thereby tailoring the analytical process to suit specific research objectives. In theory, Seq2scFv should be able to handle scFv sequences generated by any long-read sequencing platform, including newer generations of PacBio sequencers and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as the framework is independent of pre-processing and only requires paired VH-VL sequences in FASTA format.",

R. Lykoskoufis, Ioannis Xenarios, Bulak Arpat\n## Abstract\nAntibodies have emerged as the leading class of biotherapeutics, yet traditional screening methods face significant time and resource challenges in identifying lead candidates. Integrating highthroughput sequencing with computational approaches marks a pivotal advancement in antibody discovery, expanding the antibody space to explore. In this context, a major breakthrough has been the full-length sequencing of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) used in in vitro display libraries. However, few tools address the task of annotating the paired heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL), which is the primary advantage of full-scFv sequencing. To address this methodological gap, we introduce Seq2scFv, a novel open-source toolkit designed for analyzing in vitro display libraries from long-read sequencing platforms. Seq2scFv facilitates the identification and thorough characterization of V(D)J recombination in both VH and VL regions. In addition to providing annotated scFvs, translated sequences and numbered chains, Seq2scFv enables linker inference and characterization, sequence encoding with unique identifiers and quantification of identical sequences across selection rounds, thereby simplifying enrichment identification. With its versatile and standalone functionality, we anticipate that the implementation of Seq2scFv tools in antibody discovery pipelines will efficiently expedite the full characterization of display libraries and potentially facilitate the identification of high-affinity antibody candidates.\n## Introduction\nThis contextualizes each position within the antibody structure according to established schemes such as Chothia, 15 Kabat, 16 IMGT 17 and several others reviewed in Dondelinger et al. 18 Tools such as ANARCI, 19 AbRSA, 20 AbNum 21 or AntPack 22 have been developed for antibody numbering. \n\nIn parallel to advancements in bioinformatics methods, the innovative application of Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) longread HiFi sequencing to in vitro display libraries has enabled the high-throughput full-length sequencing of recombinant antibodies. 23 Previously, reading both the heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable domains that constitute single chain variable fragments (scFvs) was a challenge due to the limitation of most NGS platforms to fragments of 500 bp, while scFvs typically span around 850 base pairs (bp). 24 Fully sequencing both chains is particularly valuable. Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, 25 with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, 26 evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding. 27 Furthermore, the light chain plays a role in specificity, 28 with specific regions influencing the structure of the HCDR3 loop. 29 Therefore, sequencing the entire scFv provides crucial information for identifying better binders. 30 he advent of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing on PacBio platforms has already enabled the identification of antibodies with a diverse range of affinities, epitopes and biophysical characteristics, by leveraging full-length scFvs information in in vitro display libraries. 3,31 urrently, there is a gap in the landscape of antibody annotation methods as not many tools address the annotation of VH and VL in a single read, a requisite for the analysis of full length scFvs. 32 Though IMGT/HighV-Quest 13 does provide a scFv analysis option, it is only provided as a web server and is not open source. Additionally, it limits the V(D)J alignment to IMGT sequences, as it does not provide the option of using custom germline gene databases.\n\n## Discussion\n6][7] Moreover, with the progress in high-throughput long-read sequencing, it is now possible to interrogate display libraries at an unparalleled depth coupled with unprecedented levels of detail. Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries  were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine. \n\nAs the yield of full-length paired antibody data continues to increase, it is crucial for computational tools to keep pace and provide solutions for large-scale comprehensive characterization of scFvs. Seq2scFv addresses the challenges of characterizing both V-domains in a single read, by combining existing tools for the analysis of single domains (IgBLAST and AntPack) with custom scripts specifically developed to delimit and validate scFvs. Seq2scFv identified, characterized and validated 17,479 scFvs (representing 14,764 unique scFvs). The results, compiled in a single table, encapsulate the extensive characterization of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a wide array of attributes across several categories. This includes identifiers (such as amino acid and nucleotide SEGUIDs), sequence information (paired VH-VL sequences, scFv and linker start and end positions, translation frames, linker annotations), linker sequence evaluation, quality flags (indicating the validity and productivity of the sequences), and specific annotations for heavy and light chains (covering gene loci, stop codons, frameshifts, and germline alignments).\n...\nSeq2scFv's encoding of sequences also offers a useful solution for future inter-study comparisons. Input reads, nucleotide and amino acid scFvs, are all encoded with a SEGUID, which enables the efficient comparison and identification of identical sequences across panning rounds within the same experiment, or even across different experiments, databases and platforms. Overall, it is a robust feature for tracking and managing antibody data processed with Seq2scFv. \n\nApart from evaluating annotated scFvs, it is also of great interest to evaluate preprocessing statistics to consider the overall experiment quality. The preprocessing statistics acquired prior to Seq2scFv analyses highlight the number of reads discarded at various filtering stages, including quality, adapter removal, and size filtering, enabling researchers to assess the accurate construction of the libraries. Additionally, by examining read length distributions, researchers can identify sequences at unexpected lengths, uncovering potential issues during library preparation, amplification, or the presence of adapter sequences. Moreover, detecting an increase in the frequency of specific length intervals in later panning rounds implies an effective reduction in antibody diversity and a potential enhancement in specificity as selection progresses, validating the panning process. Sharing feedback with the laboratory based on these observations can enhance experimental practices and improve data quality in subsequent experiments. \n\nIn conclusion, Seq2scFv stands as a versatile and accessible toolkit for the analysis of full-length scFvs sequences obtained through long-read sequencing methods. Its open-source nature, free for academic use but subject to a commercial license for commercial purposes, ensures widespread accessibility while addressing proprietary concerns. Notably, the flexibility inherent in Seq2scFv tools enables researchers to customize key parameters such as germline gene databases, numbering schemes, and quality thresholds, thereby tailoring the analytical process to suit specific research objectives. In theory, Seq2scFv should be able to handle scFv sequences generated by any long-read sequencing platform, including newer generations of PacBio sequencers and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as the framework is independent of pre-processing and only requires paired VH-VL sequences in FASTA format.\n...\nIn theory, Seq2scFv should be able to handle scFv sequences generated by any long-read sequencing platform, including newer generations of PacBio sequencers and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as the framework is independent of pre-processing and only requires paired VH-VL sequences in FASTA format. Although such data is not yet publicly available, future benchmarks may become possible as interest in the field grows, leading to more datasets and potentially demonstrating the broader applicability of Seq2scFv across diverse experimental setups. Lastly, the standalone functionality of Seq2scFv provides researchers with the reassurance of data security and privacy, eliminating the need to share sequences online and mitigating potential intellectual property issues. With its emphasis on rapid processing, robust analysis, and comprehensive annotation, we anticipate that Seq2scFv will accelerate the identification and characterization of lead antibody candidates with enhanced efficiency and accuracy.",

These technologies bypass the use of animals and allow for the enrichment of binders within days to weeks. The power of in vitro selection technologies relies on a direct physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody variable domain genes), allowing for the identification of binders through sequencing of their encoding genes. Multiple rounds of selection are generally required to identify antigen-specific binders, either by binding to a solid support or through cellular sorting (5). In many cases, later rounds of selections tend to be dominated by a handful of clones, which are then further characterized for affinity. Such clonal dominance can reflect genuine selection for high antigen affinity but might also reflect other properties such as superior expression or display. Consequently, clones with superior affinity may be present at low frequency and may not be readily detectable using traditional screening methods such as ELISA (6). \n\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and computing power over the last decade has led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing and has simplified data analyses (7). Although initially developed for genomics applications, such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is now increasingly being applied other fields, including to basic and applied immunology. This includes the sequencing of the paired human heavy and light chain repertoire from isolated na\u00efve (8,9) and antigen-specific B-cells (10,11), as well as T-cell receptor (12) and antibody display repertoires (13). While most NGS platforms were originally designed for short reads, technology is evolving rapidly, extending both read length and depth. Here, we review recent advances in NGS technology and key applications to phage display and other in vitro selection technologies.",

Langley, D. Christ\n## Abstract\nIn vitro selection technology has transformed the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Using methods such as phage, ribosome, and yeast display, high affinity binders can be selected from diverse repertoires. Here, we review strategies for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of phage- and other antibody-display libraries, as well as NGS platforms and analysis tools. Moreover, we discuss recent examples relating to the use of NGS to assess library diversity, clonal enrichment, and affinity maturation.\n## inTRODUCTiOn\nThe development of antibody display technology such as phage (1), ribosome (2), yeast (3), and mammalian display (4) has enabled the rapid selection of binders from diverse libraries. These technologies bypass the use of animals and allow for the enrichment of binders within days to weeks. The power of in vitro selection technologies relies on a direct physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody variable domain genes), allowing for the identification of binders through sequencing of their encoding genes. Multiple rounds of selection are generally required to identify antigen-specific binders, either by binding to a solid support or through cellular sorting (5). In many cases, later rounds of selections tend to be dominated by a handful of clones, which are then further characterized for affinity. Such clonal dominance can reflect genuine selection for high antigen affinity but might also reflect other properties such as superior expression or display. Consequently, clones with superior affinity may be present at low frequency and may not be readily detectable using traditional screening methods such as ELISA (6). \n\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and computing power over the last decade has led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing and has simplified data analyses (7). Although initially developed for genomics applications, such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is now increasingly being applied other fields, including to basic and applied immunology. This includes the sequencing of the paired human heavy and light chain repertoire from isolated na\u00efve (8,9) and antigen-specific B-cells (10,11), as well as T-cell receptor (12) and antibody display repertoires (13). While most NGS platforms were originally designed for short reads, technology is evolving rapidly, extending both read length and depth. Here, we review recent advances in NGS technology and key applications to phage display and other in vitro selection technologies.\n\n## COnCLUSiOn\nNext-generation sequencing holds great promise for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, by allowing unprecedented insights into library diversity and clonal enrichment. Although current NGS platforms were not designed with antibody libraries in mind, the technologies are now at a stage where unique sequence insights into all stages of the selection process can be obtained. Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads. We conclude that, with NGS technology evolving at a rapid pace, its importance in the sequence analyses of phage-and other antibody-display libraries is likely to continue to increase.",

            "abstract": "Background: There is an unmet medical need to develop a vaccine targeting endemic coronaviruses. Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for many assays to support vaccine development. Objective: In this study, we used the HuCal Fab phage display library with a diversity of 4.5 \u00d7 1010 to identify antibodies specific to the spike proteins of the four endemic coronaviruses: OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. Methods: As proof of concept, we established a newly designed platform using a long-read NGS workflow for antibody discovery and compared the results against the traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing consisting of lengthy and laborious benchwork. Results: The long-read NGS workflow identified most of the antibodies seen from the Sanger sequencing workflow, and many more additional antigen-specific antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses. Overall efficiency improved up to three times, comparing the traditional workflow with the NGS workflow. Of the 113 NGS-derived mAbs isolated to bind the four endemic coronavirus spike proteins, 107/113 (94.7%) had potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 < 150 ng/mL, or <1 nM), and 61/113 (54%) had extremely potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 of <15 ng/mL, or <0.1 nM). Conclusions: We successfully developed and incorporated the long-read NGS workflow to generate target-specific antibodies with many antibodies at sub-nanomolar affinities that are likely missed by a traditional workflow. We identified strong neutralizing antibodies, proving that our endemic spike proteins are capable of generating antibodies that could offer protection against the endemic HCoVs.",

The expression vectors transformed E. coli, and the cell lysate was assessed for specific antigen binding by ELISA. The positive binding colonies were cherry-picked for Sanger sequencing. Antibody sequences appearing three times or more in Sanger sequencing were expressed in larger-scale production as bivalent Fab in E. coli for further binding characterizations before their conversion into full-length human IgG1. \n\nsequencing were expressed in larger-scale production as bivalent Fab in E. coli for further binding characterizations before their conversion into full-length human IgG1. For the NGS workflow (Figure 1), the same antibody gene fragment digested from phagemid DNA was directly sent out for PacBio long-read NGS. The top 20 or more of the most frequent antibodies observed in the NGS data sets were directly expressed as full-length human IgG1 for testing. Due to the substantially less hands-on bench work time involved in the NGS workflow, we were able to focus on panning for the next set of target antigens, thus improving our throughput by three times per year for the number of target antigens screened for antibody generation.",

                    "text": "The newly developed NGS workflow is extremely beneficial in the rapid advancement of monoclonal antibody discovery. Direct costs for sequencing through Sanger or PacBio platforms are similar, but the indirect costs (bench scientist time, etc.) are much lower with the NGS platform. The incorporation of the NGS workflow bypassed weeks of hands-on bench work. We were able to start panning immediately for the next set of antigen targets when the first batch was in the NGS sequencing stage. The improved efficiency translated into a three-fold increase in the number of target antigens that we can process per year. Furthermore, the PacBio NGS platform's long-read capability provided us with tens of thousands of sequencing reads, which is impossible to achieve with a traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing. With the power of deep sequencing and deep mining of antibody sequences, we generated many antibodies that would have been likely to be missed by the traditional workflow. Furthermore, with a much larger data set sequence, the NGS approach provided a more accurate antibody frequency ranking, as can be seen in Table 1. \n\nFrom the initial 4.5 \u00d7 10 10 phage library diversity and over 1 \u00d7 10 12 phage particles input for panning, we obtained highly specific antibodies against each of the endemic coronaviruses' spike proteins with high affinity. The output phage at the end of four rounds of panning endured a total of over 60 stringent washes, which guarantees the efficient removal of non-specific binding phages. It is unsurprising that all the tested antibodies identified from the NGS workflow were specific and had high affinity even without the previous ELISA screening used in the traditional workflow. \n\nThe numbering in the antibody ID reflects its frequency ranking among NGS-identified antibodies. There is no correlation between antibody rank and binding strength. In fact, most antibodies with a lower frequency ranking had similar ELISA titration curves compared to higher-ranking antibodies. As seen in Table 3, none of the 229E-neutralizing antibodies contained a second ID from the traditional workflow, indicating that all these neutralizing antibodies were identified from the NGS workflow.",

                    "text": "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.",

Vora, Arthur Fridman, Zhifeng Chen\n## Abstract\nBackground: There is an unmet medical need to develop a vaccine targeting endemic coronaviruses. Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for many assays to support vaccine development. Objective: In this study, we used the HuCal Fab phage display library with a diversity of 4.5 \u00d7 1010 to identify antibodies specific to the spike proteins of the four endemic coronaviruses: OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. Methods: As proof of concept, we established a newly designed platform using a long-read NGS workflow for antibody discovery and compared the results against the traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing consisting of lengthy and laborious benchwork. Results: The long-read NGS workflow identified most of the antibodies seen from the Sanger sequencing workflow, and many more additional antigen-specific antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses. Overall efficiency improved up to three times, comparing the traditional workflow with the NGS workflow. Of the 113 NGS-derived mAbs isolated to bind the four endemic coronavirus spike proteins, 107/113 (94.7%) had potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 < 150 ng/mL, or <1 nM), and 61/113 (54%) had extremely potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 of <15 ng/mL, or <0.1 nM). Conclusions: We successfully developed and incorporated the long-read NGS workflow to generate target-specific antibodies with many antibodies at sub-nanomolar affinities that are likely missed by a traditional workflow. We identified strong neutralizing antibodies, proving that our endemic spike proteins are capable of generating antibodies that could offer protection against the endemic HCoVs.\n## Introduction\nGeorge P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.\n...\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion. The HuCAL PLATINUM library is a second-generation, synthetic Human Fab library optimized from the previous HuCAL Gold library. The HuCAL PLATINUM library has been improved to contain less undesirable glycosylation while improving expression levels. The strategy for the design of its CDRs incorporated the length and distribution of natural amino acids in the human repertoire. Overall, the HuCAL PLATINUM library generates more unique sequences containing more highaffinity antibodies against targets when compared to the previous HuCAL Gold library [27]. \n\nTaking advantage of the deep sequencing power of the PacBio NGS platform, we developed a deep panning strategy using the HuCAL Platinum library to discover spike protein-specific antibodies for the endemic HCoV. We compared our NGS data set with the results from the traditional platform using Sanger sequencing. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report applying PacBio long-read NGS in combination with the phage display panning of large-size Human Fab libraries.\n\n## Traditional Phage-Panning Workflow vs. Long-Read NGS Workflow\nIn the traditional workflow (Figure 1) using Sanger sequencing, the antibody gene fragments digested from phagemid DNA were cloned into expression vectors for bivalent Fab. The expression vectors transformed E. coli, and the cell lysate was assessed for specific antigen binding by ELISA. The positive binding colonies were cherry-picked for Sanger sequencing. Antibody sequences appearing three times or more in Sanger sequencing were expressed in larger-scale production as bivalent Fab in E. coli for further binding characterizations before their conversion into full-length human IgG1. \n\nsequencing were expressed in larger-scale production as bivalent Fab in E. coli for further binding characterizations before their conversion into full-length human IgG1. For the NGS workflow (Figure 1), the same antibody gene fragment digested from phagemid DNA was directly sent out for PacBio long-read NGS. The top 20 or more of the most frequent antibodies observed in the NGS data sets were directly expressed as full-length human IgG1 for testing. Due to the substantially less hands-on bench work time involved in the NGS workflow, we were able to focus on panning for the next set of target antigens, thus improving our throughput by three times per year for the number of target antigens screened for antibody generation.\n\n## Discussion\nThe newly developed NGS workflow is extremely beneficial in the rapid advancement of monoclonal antibody discovery. Direct costs for sequencing through Sanger or PacBio platforms are similar, but the indirect costs (bench scientist time, etc.) are much lower with the NGS platform. The incorporation of the NGS workflow bypassed weeks of hands-on bench work. We were able to start panning immediately for the next set of antigen targets when the first batch was in the NGS sequencing stage. The improved efficiency translated into a three-fold increase in the number of target antigens that we can process per year. Furthermore, the PacBio NGS platform's long-read capability provided us with tens of thousands of sequencing reads, which is impossible to achieve with a traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing. With the power of deep sequencing and deep mining of antibody sequences, we generated many antibodies that would have been likely to be missed by the traditional workflow. Furthermore, with a much larger data set sequence, the NGS approach provided a more accurate antibody frequency ranking, as can be seen in Table 1. \n\nFrom the initial 4.5 \u00d7 10 10 phage library diversity and over 1 \u00d7 10 12 phage particles input for panning, we obtained highly specific antibodies against each of the endemic coronaviruses' spike proteins with high affinity. The output phage at the end of four rounds of panning endured a total of over 60 stringent washes, which guarantees the efficient removal of non-specific binding phages. It is unsurprising that all the tested antibodies identified from the NGS workflow were specific and had high affinity even without the previous ELISA screening used in the traditional workflow. \n\nThe numbering in the antibody ID reflects its frequency ranking among NGS-identified antibodies. There is no correlation between antibody rank and binding strength. In fact, most antibodies with a lower frequency ranking had similar ELISA titration curves compared to higher-ranking antibodies. As seen in Table 3, none of the 229E-neutralizing antibodies contained a second ID from the traditional workflow, indicating that all these neutralizing antibodies were identified from the NGS workflow.",

                    "text": "The paradigm-shifting development of hybridoma technology revolutionized the field of antibody production with the discovery of monoclonal antibodies [1].In 2022, six out of the fifteen best-selling pharmaceuticals were monoclonal antibodies (even more if COVID-19 vaccines are not considered); these figures illustrate the magnitude of the impact that these molecules have had in research and medicine [2].Subsequently, the advent of recombinant protein production techniques and the application of directed evolution methodologies have further transformed the antibody discovery landscape [3].\n\nPhage display technology stands as the most prominent methodology for the development of recombinant antibodies in the context of the directed evolution of proteins.This method is based on the construction of antibody libraries derived from diverse sources with high variability [4].A characteristic feature of these libraries is that the antibodies are expressed fused to the coat proteins of bacteriophages, which facilitates their affinity selection through successive rounds against the target antigen (biopanning) [5].\n\nTraditionally, monitoring of the panning procedure has been performed by colony picking and Sanger sequencing since the 1990s.However, while these methods can be automated for the screening of thousands of different colonies, they only cover a small amount of the clones implied in the process.This problem may be solved by using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) techniques [6].The in-depth analysis of phage libraries by NGS has proven to be an exceptionally effective approach for clone identification, including rare low-frequency variants that may not amplify adequately within the phage population [7].Moreover, NGS has facilitated the identification and reconstruction of complementarity-determining region (CDR) combinations of antibody fragments from phage selection outputs [8].Beyond antibody libraries, this transformative technique extends its applicability to the study of peptide libraries, essential for epitope mapping of antibodies [9].\n\nOxford Nanopore Technology offers many advantages that have revolutionized the field of DNA sequencing and genomic analysis.Firstly, the portable and compact sequencing devices provide unprecedented flexibility, enabling real-time, in situ, and rapid DNA sequencing in diverse environments, including field research and clinical settings.Secondly, the sequencing technology can read exceptionally long DNA fragments, allowing for improved genome assembly and structural variant detection.",

Garcia-Calvo, Aina Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda, Santiago Rodr\u00edguez, Rosario Mart\u00edn, T. Garc\u00eda\n## Abstract\nDirected evolution is a pivotal strategy for new antibody discovery, which allowed the generation of high-affinity Fabs against gliadin from two antibody libraries in our previous studies. One of the libraries was exclusively derived from celiac patients\u2019 mRNA (immune library) while the other was obtained through a protein engineering approach (semi-immune library). Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques are revolutionizing research across genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. In the present work, an Oxford Nanopore in-lab sequencing device was used to comprehensively characterize the composition of the constructed libraries, both at the beginning and throughout the phage-mediated selection processes against gliadin. A customized analysis pipeline was used to select high-quality reads, annotate chain distribution, perform sequence analysis, and conduct statistical comparisons between the different selection rounds. Some immunological attributes of the most representative phage variants after the selection process were also determined. Sequencing results revealed the successful transfer of the celiac immune response features to the immune library and the antibodies derived from it, suggesting the crucial role of these features in guiding the selection of high-affinity recombinant Fabs against gliadin. In summary, high-throughput DNA sequencing has improved our understanding of the selection processes aimed at generating molecular binders against gliadin.\n## Introduction\nThe paradigm-shifting development of hybridoma technology revolutionized the field of antibody production with the discovery of monoclonal antibodies [1].In 2022, six out of the fifteen best-selling pharmaceuticals were monoclonal antibodies (even more if COVID-19 vaccines are not considered); these figures illustrate the magnitude of the impact that these molecules have had in research and medicine [2].Subsequently, the advent of recombinant protein production techniques and the application of directed evolution methodologies have further transformed the antibody discovery landscape [3].\n\nPhage display technology stands as the most prominent methodology for the development of recombinant antibodies in the context of the directed evolution of proteins.This method is based on the construction of antibody libraries derived from diverse sources with high variability [4].A characteristic feature of these libraries is that the antibodies are expressed fused to the coat proteins of bacteriophages, which facilitates their affinity selection through successive rounds against the target antigen (biopanning) [5].\n\nTraditionally, monitoring of the panning procedure has been performed by colony picking and Sanger sequencing since the 1990s.However, while these methods can be automated for the screening of thousands of different colonies, they only cover a small amount of the clones implied in the process.This problem may be solved by using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) techniques [6].The in-depth analysis of phage libraries by NGS has proven to be an exceptionally effective approach for clone identification, including rare low-frequency variants that may not amplify adequately within the phage population [7].Moreover, NGS has facilitated the identification and reconstruction of complementarity-determining region (CDR) combinations of antibody fragments from phage selection outputs [8].Beyond antibody libraries, this transformative technique extends its applicability to the study of peptide libraries, essential for epitope mapping of antibodies [9].\n\nOxford Nanopore Technology offers many advantages that have revolutionized the field of DNA sequencing and genomic analysis.Firstly, the portable and compact sequencing devices provide unprecedented flexibility, enabling real-time, in situ, and rapid DNA sequencing in diverse environments, including field research and clinical settings.Secondly, the sequencing technology can read exceptionally long DNA fragments, allowing for improved genome assembly and structural variant detection.\n\n## Conclusions\nThis study presents an illustrative demonstration of a rapid and precise methodology for sequencing and analyzing antibody repertoires (and their usage) generated through phage-mediated affinity-selection processes.The utilization of Oxford Nanopore technology facilitated a user-friendly and expeditious sequencing approach using portable equipment.This compact device enables the acquisition of significantly longer reads, thereby allowing simultaneous sequencing of the entire Fab, obviating the need for assembly from fragmented reads.The proposed workflow analysis enabled the generation of valuable data for a comprehensive characterization of the selection process, revealing features that may be overlooked by other analytical methods, such as traditional Sanger sequencing of individual colonies.This approach provides a deeper insight into the selection process, capturing additional information that would otherwise be inaccessible due to the size of the data generated.\n\nThe primary analysis approach facilitated a rapid and seamless handling of the raw data produced by the sequencing device.This encompassed key steps such as basecalling utilizing neural networks, demultiplexing, quality analysis, trimming low-quality sequences, and alignment against the reference genome.These steps effectively prepared the data for secondary analysis focused on antibody data generation, utilizing only highquality sequences.\n\nThe secondary analysis involved the utilization of bioinformatics tools, specifically IMGT/HighV-Quest, for the classification of reads based on VDJ genes, CDR features, and clonotype organization.Additionally, IMGT/StatClonotype was employed for statistical analysis, and alignment-dependent analysis was conducted for isotyping and mutation analysis.These bioinformatics tools provided essential functionalities to enable comprehensive exploration and interpretation of the obtained data in an immunological context.\n\nThe progression of the panning process of the immune library against gliadin revealed a discernible selection pattern, as evidenced by the substantial expansion of VH3-15 variants within the Fab population starting from round 2, despite the initial presence of over 30 heavy chain families.While there were notable alterations observed in the composition of light chains, the data suggest that these chains did not play a significant role in the depicted selection process.\n\nThe analysis specifically targeting the merged chain library revealed that the conservation and expansion of features observed in the transformation of a pre-existing dAb into a Fab were not dependent on molecular selection.",

Most current studies predominantly use short-read sequencing, gene panels, or microarrays to explore these alterations; however, these technologies can systematically miss or misrepresent certain types of alterations, especially structural variants, complex rearrangements, and alterations within repetitive regions. Long-read sequencing is rapidly emerging as a transformative technology for cancer research by providing a comprehensive view across the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, including the ability to detect alterations that previous technologies have overlooked. In this Perspective, we explore the current applications of long-read sequencing for both germline and somatic cancer analysis. We provide an overview of the computational methodologies tailored to long-read data and highlight key discoveries and resources within cancer genomics that were previously inaccessible with prior technologies. We also address future opportunities and persistent challenges, including the experimental and computational requirements needed to scale to larger sample sizes, the hurdles in sequencing and analyzing complex cancer genomes, and opportunities for leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies for cancer informatics. We further discuss how the telomere-to-telomere genome and the emerging human pangenome could enhance the resolution of cancer genome analysis, potentially revolutionizing early detection and disease monitoring in patients.

Most current studies predominantly use short-read sequencing, gene panels, or microarrays to explore these alterations; however, these technologies can systematically miss or misrepresent certain types of alterations, especially structural variants, complex rearrangements, and alterations within repetitive regions. Long-read sequencing is rapidly emerging as a transformative technology for cancer research by providing a comprehensive view across the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, including the ability to detect alterations that previous technologies have overlooked. In this Perspective, we explore the current applications of long-read sequencing for both germline and somatic cancer analysis. We provide an overview of the computational methodologies tailored to long-read data and highlight key discoveries and resources within cancer genomics that were previously inaccessible with prior technologies. We also address future opportunities and persistent challenges, including the experimental and computational requirements needed to scale to larger sample sizes, the hurdles in sequencing and analyzing complex cancer genomes, and opportunities for leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies for cancer informatics. We further discuss how the telomere-to-telomere genome and the emerging human pangenome could enhance the resolution of cancer genome analysis, potentially revolutionizing early detection and disease monitoring in patients. Finally, we outline strategies for transitioning long-read sequencing from research applications to routine clinical practice.\n## body\nAddressing these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Single Molecule Real Time sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, have emerged as powerful alternatives to short-read sequencing (Fig. 1; van Dijk et al. 2023).

However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. 28,29 Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. 30 Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123. Mining these two independent libraries enabled the identification of a large and diverse panel of high-quality antibodies.\n\nHemadou et al. demonstrated that the combination of SMRT sequencing with circular consensus adapter ligation allowed the identification of full-length scFvs from an enriched phage display library. By tracking a manually selected clone, they identified its presence in the top 100 of the pool of reads and they were able to determine an accuracy of >99.9% for complete sequences of inserts approaching 1,000 bp. Although this supports the robustness of the combinatorial method, it does not give insights on the functionality and diversity of the scFvs contained in the phage library. 13 Similarly, Han and colleagues used this approach to investigate phage display libraries that had shown high clonality using traditional screening methods and, although they identified several new clones, they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of",

Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies.

This method enables the rapid isolation of functional and specific antibodies from selected phage display libraries, allowing the identification of diverse antibody clones with a broad range of affinities, epitopes and biophysical characteristics.\n\n## Discussion\nNGS technologies have been used in combination with phage display in a number of applications. 24,25 While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length 26,27 and signal integrity 16 of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. 28,29 Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. 30 Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123. Mining these two independent libraries enabled the identification of a large and diverse panel of high-quality antibodies.\n\nHemadou et al. demonstrated that the combination of SMRT sequencing with circular consensus adapter ligation allowed the identification of full-length scFvs from an enriched phage display library. By tracking a manually selected clone, they identified its presence in the top 100 of the pool of reads and they were able to determine an accuracy of >99.9% for complete sequences of inserts approaching 1,000 bp. Although this supports the robustness of the combinatorial method, it does not give insights on the functionality and diversity of the scFvs contained in the phage library. 13 Similarly, Han and colleagues used this approach to investigate phage display libraries that had shown high clonality using traditional screening methods and, although they identified several new clones, they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Antibody discovery using invitro display technologies such as phage and/or yeast display has become acornerstone in many research and development projects, including the creation of new drugs for clinical use. Traditionally, after the selection phase, random clones are isolated for binding validation and Sanger sequencing. More recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has allowed deeper insight into the antibody population after aselection campaign, enabling the identification of many more specific binders. However, this approach only provides the DNA sequences of potential binders, the properties of which need to be fully elucidated by obtaining corresponding clones and expressing them for further validation. Here we present arapid novel method to harvest potential clones identified by NGS that uses asimple PCR and yeast recombination approach. The protocol was tested in selections against three different targets and was able to recover clones at an abundance level that would be impractical to identify using traditional methods.",

The importance of this platform was recognized by the award of the 2018 Noble Prize to scientists that developed the technology. 21 One of the main limitations of the standard screening method is that, during the biopanning process, some binding clones become dominant (as was observed for the OX40 selection), resulting in identification of alimited number of different candidates after screening. For example, in our study only 40 of 384 clones would not have been derived from the dominant clone in the OX40 selection. The advent of NGS has dramatically increased the depth and breadth of the analysis of display library selection outputs, making it possible to obtain information not only on the clones identified using aconventional colony screening method, but also additional, less abundant, candidates.- 14,15,20,22 Among the most commonly used NGS platforms, there has been asteady increase in the number and length of reads that can be obtained, but only PacBio has invested in increasing read length to alevel commensurate with obtaining full-length sequences of displayed antibody-like molecules, i. e., scFvs and Fabs. For this reason, isolating clones identified by NGS from aselection campaign, to test their functional properties, continues to be achallenge. With PacBio now able to provide full-length clone sequences, gene synthesis is avaluable option, but remains prohibitive on alarge scale, even if the cost of gene synthesis is becoming significantly cheaper. Furthermore, gene synthesis usually takes weeks. We previously described an approach allowing the direct isolation of NGS identified clones of interest from aselected library using an inverse PCR 23 and ligation-based strategy that exploits the unique barcode nature of the HCDR3 sequence  to synthesize pairs of outward-facing primers that used to amplify plasmids containing the HCDR3. 15 However, that approach was not very effective for short HCDR3s or clones with abundances less than 1%. \n\nHere, we explored afaster, cheaper method, requiring the design of asingle specific primer for each HCDR3 of interest, to quickly translate an NGS analysis into actual clones.",

Ferrara, Andre A R Teixeira, L. Naranjo, M. F. Erasmus, S. D\u2019Angelo, A. R. Bradbury\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Antibody discovery using invitro display technologies such as phage and/or yeast display has become acornerstone in many research and development projects, including the creation of new drugs for clinical use. Traditionally, after the selection phase, random clones are isolated for binding validation and Sanger sequencing. More recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has allowed deeper insight into the antibody population after aselection campaign, enabling the identification of many more specific binders. However, this approach only provides the DNA sequences of potential binders, the properties of which need to be fully elucidated by obtaining corresponding clones and expressing them for further validation. Here we present arapid novel method to harvest potential clones identified by NGS that uses asimple PCR and yeast recombination approach. The protocol was tested in selections against three different targets and was able to recover clones at an abundance level that would be impractical to identify using traditional methods.\n## Discussion\nDisplay-based technologies, in particular phage display, have been successfully applied to the discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies. The importance of this platform was recognized by the award of the 2018 Noble Prize to scientists that developed the technology. 21 One of the main limitations of the standard screening method is that, during the biopanning process, some binding clones become dominant (as was observed for the OX40 selection), resulting in identification of alimited number of different candidates after screening. For example, in our study only 40 of 384 clones would not have been derived from the dominant clone in the OX40 selection. The advent of NGS has dramatically increased the depth and breadth of the analysis of display library selection outputs, making it possible to obtain information not only on the clones identified using aconventional colony screening method, but also additional, less abundant, candidates.- 14,15,20,22 Among the most commonly used NGS platforms, there has been asteady increase in the number and length of reads that can be obtained, but only PacBio has invested in increasing read length to alevel commensurate with obtaining full-length sequences of displayed antibody-like molecules, i. e., scFvs and Fabs. For this reason, isolating clones identified by NGS from aselection campaign, to test their functional properties, continues to be achallenge. With PacBio now able to provide full-length clone sequences, gene synthesis is avaluable option, but remains prohibitive on alarge scale, even if the cost of gene synthesis is becoming significantly cheaper. Furthermore, gene synthesis usually takes weeks. We previously described an approach allowing the direct isolation of NGS identified clones of interest from aselected library using an inverse PCR 23 and ligation-based strategy that exploits the unique barcode nature of the HCDR3 sequence  to synthesize pairs of outward-facing primers that used to amplify plasmids containing the HCDR3. 15 However, that approach was not very effective for short HCDR3s or clones with abundances less than 1%. \n\nHere, we explored afaster, cheaper method, requiring the design of asingle specific primer for each HCDR3 of interest, to quickly translate an NGS analysis into actual clones.",

Even when performing Sanger sequencing in-house, there is still an estimated turnaround time of 5 days and cost of US$70-120 per antibody. 10 Sanger sequencing is further complicated by the potential presence of multiple heavy-and light-chain transcripts in the same cell. An estimated 30% of all hybridomas express more than one productive heavy or light chain. 13 5][16][17] However, these protocols also rely on species-specific primers and generate partial-length reads (up to 600 bp) which require assembly, while the high throughput is not well-suited to monoclonal antibody sequencing for a limited number of cell lines. \n\nLong-read sequencing allows for the full-length sequencing of antibodies, but a relatively high error rate compared with the above short-read sequencing approaches has limited its application in antibody sequencing thus far. 18 PacBio long-read sequencing has been applied to the sequencing of single B cells, 19 phage display libraries, 20,21 and repertoire sequencing, 22 but its high cost makes it difficult to implement routinely. By contrast, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has a much lower capital cost and flexible throughput, with raw-read accuracy having improved in recent years to >95%, enabling its use for the sequencing of phage display outputs. 23 However, the remaining errors in ONT, notably systematic homopolymer errors (insertions/deletions in tracts of >5 identical bases) can lead to frameshifts, complicating translation of nanopore-derived sequences into accurate antibody protein sequences. 24",

Uren, S. Nutt, Matthew E. Ritchie, Quentin Gouil, R. Kluck\n## Abstract\nDespite their common use in research, monoclonal antibodies are currently not systematically sequenced. This can lead to issues with reproducibility and the occasional loss of antibodies with loss of cell lines. Hybridoma cell lines have been the primary means of generating monoclonal antibodies from immunized animals including mice, rats, rabbits and alpacas. Excluding therapeutic antibodies, few hybridoma-derived antibody sequences are known. Sanger sequencing has been \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for antibody gene sequencing but relies on the availability of species-specific degenerate primer sets for amplification of light and heavy antibody genes, in addition to lengthy and expensive cDNA preparation. Here we leveraged recent improvements in long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to develop NAb-seq: a three-day, species-independent, and cost-effective workflow to characterize paired full-length immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes from hybridoma cell lines. When compared to Sanger sequencing of two hybridoma cell lines, long-read ONT sequencing was highly accurate, reliable, and amenable to high throughput. We further show that the method is applicable to single cells, allowing efficient antibody discovery in rare populations such as memory B cells. In summary, NAb-seq promises to accelerate identification and validation of hybridoma antibodies as well as antibodies from single B cells used in research, diagnostics and therapeutics.\n## Introduction\nThis technique has been successfully applied to sequence rat, mouse, and human antibody transcripts, [9][10][11] including from single B cells. 12 In addition to these complexities of variable region PCR, Sanger sequencing by commercial providers is costly and slow: around US$800 (2 weeks) for the variable regions (V H and V L ) and US$2,000 (4 weeks) for the full-length antibody (variable and constant regions). Even when performing Sanger sequencing in-house, there is still an estimated turnaround time of 5 days and cost of US$70-120 per antibody. 10 Sanger sequencing is further complicated by the potential presence of multiple heavy-and light-chain transcripts in the same cell. An estimated 30% of all hybridomas express more than one productive heavy or light chain. 13 5][16][17] However, these protocols also rely on species-specific primers and generate partial-length reads (up to 600 bp) which require assembly, while the high throughput is not well-suited to monoclonal antibody sequencing for a limited number of cell lines. \n\nLong-read sequencing allows for the full-length sequencing of antibodies, but a relatively high error rate compared with the above short-read sequencing approaches has limited its application in antibody sequencing thus far. 18 PacBio long-read sequencing has been applied to the sequencing of single B cells, 19 phage display libraries, 20,21 and repertoire sequencing, 22 but its high cost makes it difficult to implement routinely. By contrast, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has a much lower capital cost and flexible throughput, with raw-read accuracy having improved in recent years to >95%, enabling its use for the sequencing of phage display outputs. 23 However, the remaining errors in ONT, notably systematic homopolymer errors (insertions/deletions in tracts of >5 identical bases) can lead to frameshifts, complicating translation of nanopore-derived sequences into accurate antibody protein sequences. 24",

                    "text": "We show here that massively parallel sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries during selection with serum antibodies. From a technical standpoint, our data confirm previous studies showing that next generation sequencing can improve the resolution of methods using phage or ribosome display libraries [19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, while most of these studies focused on the discovery of peptide [19,20,21,24] and antibody [22] ligands for various targets, the present report deals with the identification of the antigen regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal responses. Moreover, our library, as well as the one used by Larman et al. [23], contained sequences obtained from natural repertories, while most of the studies cited above used random peptides libraries, whose results are sometimes difficult to interpret particularly when used in conjunction with polyclonal sera. We believe that, particularly for our application and the one described by Larman et al. [23], the use of next generation sequencing may be instrumental not only in increasing the resolution of the assay, but also in moving it from research to clinical laboratories. In this respect, the PROFILER technology, seems amenable to applications in all fields of serology, including the diagnosis of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Serology has been traditionally concerned with determining the amount of antibodies directed against a chosen antigen. We show here that -by combining the versatility of phage display with the power of next generation sequencing -it is also possible to obtain, in a time frame close to that of traditional serological techniques (i.e. within two days), precise qualitative and quantitative information about the regions of the antigen molecule that are targeted by a serum antibody response. Clearly, future studies will be needed to ascertain whether PROFILER will be useful in diagnostic testing and whether specific immunodominance patterns can be linked to well-defined pathologic features or to vaccine efficacy. \n\nThere is a great need, in vaccine research and diagnostic medicine, for rapid and simple methods to identify B cell epitopes [25]. Moreover, epitope characterization is important in the context of drug design [26].",

Beninati\n## Abstract\nThere is a need for techniques capable of identifying the antigenic epitopes targeted by polyclonal antibody responses during deliberate or natural immunization. Although successful, traditional phage library screening is laborious and can map only some of the epitopes. To accelerate and improve epitope identification, we have employed massive sequencing of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This enabled us to precisely identify the regions of a model antigen, the meningococcal NadA virulence factor, targeted by serum antibodies in vaccinated individuals and to rank hundreds of antigenic fragments according to their immunoreactivity. We found that next generation sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of antigen-specific libraries by allowing simultaneous processing of dozens of library/serum combinations in less than two days, including the time required for antibody-mediated library selection. Moreover, compared with traditional plaque picking, the new technology (named Phage-based Representation OF Immuno-Ligand Epitope Repertoire or PROFILER) provides superior resolution in epitope identification. PROFILER seems ideally suited to streamline and guide rational antigen design, adjuvant selection, and quality control of newly produced vaccines. Furthermore, this method is also susceptible to find important applications in other fields covered by traditional quantitative serology.\n## Discussion\nWe show here that massively parallel sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries during selection with serum antibodies. From a technical standpoint, our data confirm previous studies showing that next generation sequencing can improve the resolution of methods using phage or ribosome display libraries [19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, while most of these studies focused on the discovery of peptide [19,20,21,24] and antibody [22] ligands for various targets, the present report deals with the identification of the antigen regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal responses. Moreover, our library, as well as the one used by Larman et al. [23], contained sequences obtained from natural repertories, while most of the studies cited above used random peptides libraries, whose results are sometimes difficult to interpret particularly when used in conjunction with polyclonal sera. We believe that, particularly for our application and the one described by Larman et al. [23], the use of next generation sequencing may be instrumental not only in increasing the resolution of the assay, but also in moving it from research to clinical laboratories. In this respect, the PROFILER technology, seems amenable to applications in all fields of serology, including the diagnosis of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Serology has been traditionally concerned with determining the amount of antibodies directed against a chosen antigen. We show here that -by combining the versatility of phage display with the power of next generation sequencing -it is also possible to obtain, in a time frame close to that of traditional serological techniques (i.e. within two days), precise qualitative and quantitative information about the regions of the antigen molecule that are targeted by a serum antibody response. Clearly, future studies will be needed to ascertain whether PROFILER will be useful in diagnostic testing and whether specific immunodominance patterns can be linked to well-defined pathologic features or to vaccine efficacy. \n\nThere is a great need, in vaccine research and diagnostic medicine, for rapid and simple methods to identify B cell epitopes [25]. Moreover, epitope characterization is important in the context of drug design [26].",

In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",

Lowden, Kevin A. Henry\n## Abstract\nAntibody (Ab) repertoire sequencing using high-throughput massively parallel technologies has contributed substantially to the understanding of Ab responses following infection, vaccination and autoimmunity. Because individual B-cell receptors are recombined and diversified somatically, genomic comparisons are limited, and distinguishing rare variants from sequencing errors is a major challenge. Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION is a highly portable and cost-effective third-generation sequencing instrument, but has not been used for Ab repertoire sequencing due to its high error rate (approximately 1/10 bases). Here, we applied nanopore sequencing to single-domain Ab (sdAb) repertoires and phage-displayed sdAb libraries. We show that despite low overall data fidelity, sdAb sequences could be reconstructed above a frequency threshold (\u223c100 copies); however, distinguishing clonal sdAb variants was not always possible. The data quality was sufficient to enable rapid identification of antigen-specific sdAb sequences enriched during panning of phage display libraries, obviating the need for screening single clones.\n",

The application of genomics within the last 27 years has radically changed the way we understand the biology and evolution of these pathogens. In this review, we discuss how the short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) sequencing technologies have shaped the discipline of bacterial pathogen genomics, in terms of fundamental research (i.e., evolution of pathogenicity), forensics, food safety, and routine clinical microbiology. We have mined and discuss some of the most prominent data/bioinformatics resources such as NCBI pathogens, PATRIC, and Pathogenwatch. Based on this mining, we present some of the most popular sequencing technologies, hybrid approaches, assemblers, and annotation pipelines. A small number of bacterial pathogens are of very high importance, and we also present the wealth of the genomic data for these species (i.e., which ones they are, the number of antimicrobial resistance genes per genome, the number of virulence factors). Finally, we discuss how this discipline will probably be transformed in the near future, especially by transitioning into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), thanks to long-read sequencing.",

These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) [20]. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running [20]. The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% [21]. As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running [20]. The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) [22]. Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity. \n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.",

Nikolaidis, A. Hesketh\n## Abstract\nThroughout the entirety of human history, bacterial pathogens have played an important role and even shaped the fate of civilizations. The application of genomics within the last 27 years has radically changed the way we understand the biology and evolution of these pathogens. In this review, we discuss how the short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) sequencing technologies have shaped the discipline of bacterial pathogen genomics, in terms of fundamental research (i.e., evolution of pathogenicity), forensics, food safety, and routine clinical microbiology. We have mined and discuss some of the most prominent data/bioinformatics resources such as NCBI pathogens, PATRIC, and Pathogenwatch. Based on this mining, we present some of the most popular sequencing technologies, hybrid approaches, assemblers, and annotation pipelines. A small number of bacterial pathogens are of very high importance, and we also present the wealth of the genomic data for these species (i.e., which ones they are, the number of antimicrobial resistance genes per genome, the number of virulence factors). Finally, we discuss how this discipline will probably be transformed in the near future, especially by transitioning into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), thanks to long-read sequencing.\n## The Promise of Long-Read Sequencing Technologies and Hybrid Approaches\nOver the last decade, third-generation long-read sequencing technologies have emerged to address the limitations referred to above, most notably from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [18] and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [19]. These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) [20]. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running [20]. The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% [21]. As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running [20]. The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) [22]. Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity. \n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.",

                    "text": "The subsequent, or third, generation of sequencing technologies tackled long DNA fragments (> 1 kb) by PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) cell technology [18] and Oxford Nanopore MinION [19]. Where short reads use clonal amplification to overcome sequencing error and increase signal, these methods sequence a single molecule at a time. Skipping amplification allows sequencing to continue far longer along the molecule than short-read methods, but leads to a reduction in accuracy. Thus, long reads often require either higher coverage [20] or accurate short reads to correct the long reads [21] to create a highly contiguous assembly. Read length and accuracy improvements have continued from these initial platforms to generate reads of 10-25 kb through PacBio High Fidelity (HiFi -circular consensus sequencing) [22\u2022] and > 300-kb reads for Oxford Nanopore sequencing [23]. Continued improvement of HiFi sequencing has pushed read accuracy above 99% [22,24], and newer plant-specific base calling models have pushed nanopore accuracy > 95%, further strengthening genome accuracy. Long-read incorporation has resolved significant issues plaguing larger, complex genomes, namely generating nonambiguous reads and contigs that are long enough to span structural variants, repetitive regions, and TEs (Figure 2). For example, a gapless watermelon assembly discovered an additional 173 genes located in gap regions of the prior assembly, including two LRR-RLK genes, which play crucial roles in plant development [25\u2022\u2022]. Long-read platforms also have the ability to partially sequence the epigenome and epitranscriptome [10,26].",

Ware\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Long-read sequencing\nThe subsequent, or third, generation of sequencing technologies tackled long DNA fragments (> 1 kb) by PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) cell technology [18] and Oxford Nanopore MinION [19]. Where short reads use clonal amplification to overcome sequencing error and increase signal, these methods sequence a single molecule at a time. Skipping amplification allows sequencing to continue far longer along the molecule than short-read methods, but leads to a reduction in accuracy. Thus, long reads often require either higher coverage [20] or accurate short reads to correct the long reads [21] to create a highly contiguous assembly. Read length and accuracy improvements have continued from these initial platforms to generate reads of 10-25 kb through PacBio High Fidelity (HiFi -circular consensus sequencing) [22\u2022] and > 300-kb reads for Oxford Nanopore sequencing [23]. Continued improvement of HiFi sequencing has pushed read accuracy above 99% [22,24], and newer plant-specific base calling models have pushed nanopore accuracy > 95%, further strengthening genome accuracy. Long-read incorporation has resolved significant issues plaguing larger, complex genomes, namely generating nonambiguous reads and contigs that are long enough to span structural variants, repetitive regions, and TEs (Figure 2). For example, a gapless watermelon assembly discovered an additional 173 genes located in gap regions of the prior assembly, including two LRR-RLK genes, which play crucial roles in plant development [25\u2022\u2022]. Long-read platforms also have the ability to partially sequence the epigenome and epitranscriptome [10,26].",

Evaluation on 8 human genomes demonstrates that NanoCaller generally achieves better performance than competing approaches.

Long-read sequencing techniques can overcome several challenging issues that cannot be solved using shortread sequencing, such as calling long-range haplotypes, identifying variants in complex genomic regions, identifying variants in coding regions for genes with many pseudogenes, sequencing across repetitive regions, phasing distant alleles, and distinguishing highly homologous regions [8]. To date, long-read sequencing techniques have been successfully used to sequence genomes for many species to powerfully resolve various challenging biological problems such as de novo genome assembly [9][10][11][12][13] and SV detection [14][15][16][17][18][19]. However, the per-base accuracy of long reads is much lower with raw basecalling errors of 3-15% [20] compared with short-read data (although HiFi/CCS PacBio reads and Nanopore reads generated by the latest flowcells R10.3 have lower error rates, their error rates can still be much higher than that of short-read data.). The high error rate challenges widely used variant calling methods (such as GATK [1] and FreeBayes [2]), which were previously designed for Illumina short reads and cannot handle reads with higher error rates. It is also worth noting that HiFi reads after circular consensus sequencing (CCS) on PacBio long-read sequencing [21] or similar methods on the Nanopore platform can potentially improve the detection of SNPs/ indels by adapting existing short-read variant callers, due to its much lower per-base error rates. However, HiFi reads would substantially increase sequencing cost given the same base output, so it may be more suitable now for specific application scenarios such as capture-based sequencing or amplicon sequencing.",

To fully exploit the benefits of longer reads, here we present a deep learning method NanoCaller, which detects SNPs using long-range haplotype information, then phases long reads with called SNPs and calls indels with local realignment. Evaluation on 8 human genomes demonstrates that NanoCaller generally achieves better performance than competing approaches. We experimentally validate 41 novel variants in a widely used benchmarking genome, which could not be reliably detected previously. In summary, NanoCaller facilitates the discovery of novel variants in complex genomic regions from long-read sequencing.\n## Background\nOxford Nanopore (ONT) [6] and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [7] technologies are two leading long-read sequencing platforms, which have been rapidly developed in recent years with continuously decreased costs and continuously improved read length, in comparison to Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. Long-read sequencing techniques can overcome several challenging issues that cannot be solved using shortread sequencing, such as calling long-range haplotypes, identifying variants in complex genomic regions, identifying variants in coding regions for genes with many pseudogenes, sequencing across repetitive regions, phasing distant alleles, and distinguishing highly homologous regions [8]. To date, long-read sequencing techniques have been successfully used to sequence genomes for many species to powerfully resolve various challenging biological problems such as de novo genome assembly [9][10][11][12][13] and SV detection [14][15][16][17][18][19]. However, the per-base accuracy of long reads is much lower with raw basecalling errors of 3-15% [20] compared with short-read data (although HiFi/CCS PacBio reads and Nanopore reads generated by the latest flowcells R10.3 have lower error rates, their error rates can still be much higher than that of short-read data.). The high error rate challenges widely used variant calling methods (such as GATK [1] and FreeBayes [2]), which were previously designed for Illumina short reads and cannot handle reads with higher error rates. It is also worth noting that HiFi reads after circular consensus sequencing (CCS) on PacBio long-read sequencing [21] or similar methods on the Nanopore platform can potentially improve the detection of SNPs/ indels by adapting existing short-read variant callers, due to its much lower per-base error rates. However, HiFi reads would substantially increase sequencing cost given the same base output, so it may be more suitable now for specific application scenarios such as capture-based sequencing or amplicon sequencing.",

Although short-read platforms have traditionally been used for sequencing most phages, there is a growing adoption of long-read sequencing methods such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio sequencing. An advantage of long-read sequencing is its ability to detect phage DNA modifications, like methylation [76,77], which may play a role in phage resistance and adaptability to microbial communities. While there are over 2,000 phage sequences available in the SRA from Illumina platforms, fewer than 300 phages have been sequenced using longread technologies such as PacBio and Nanopore platforms (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

                    "text": "Long-read sequencing, or third-generation sequencing, offers a number of advantages over short-read sequencing [1,2]. While short-read sequencers such as Illumina's NovaSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq, and MiSeq instruments [3][4][5]; BGI's MGISEQ and BGISEQ models [6]; or Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent sequencers [7,8] produce reads of up to 600 bases, long-read sequencing technologies routinely generate reads in excess of 10 kb [1]. \n\nShort-read sequencing is cost-effective, accurate, and supported by a wide range of analysis tools and pipelines [9]. However, natural nucleic acid polymers span eight orders of magnitude in length, and sequencing them in short amplified fragments complicates the task of reconstructing and counting the original molecules. Long reads can thus improve de novo assembly, mapping certainty, transcript isoform identification, and detection of structural variants. Furthermore, long-read sequencing of native molecules, both DNA and RNA, eliminates amplification bias while preserving base modifications [10]. These capabilities, together with continuing progress in accuracy, throughput, and cost reduction, have begun to make long-read sequencing an option for a broad range of applications in genomics for model and non-model organisms [2,11]. \n\nTwo technologies currently dominate the long-read sequencing space: Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) singlemolecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing. We henceforth refer to these simply as SMRT and nanopore sequencing. SMRT and nanopore sequencing technologies were commercially released in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and since then have become suitable for an increasing number of applications. The data that these platforms produce differ qualitatively from secondgeneration sequencing, thus necessitating tailored analysis tools. \n\nGiven the broadening interest in long-read sequencing and the fast-paced development of applications and tools, the current review aims to provide a description of the guiding principles of long-read data analysis, a survey of the available tools for different tasks as well as a discussion of the areas in long-read analysis that require improvements.",

Amarasinghe, Shian Su, Xueyi Dong, L. Zappia, Matthew E. Ritchie, Quentin Gouil\n## Abstract\nLong-read technologies are overcoming early limitations in accuracy and throughput, broadening their application domains in genomics. Dedicated analysis tools that take into account the characteristics of long-read data are thus required, but the fast pace of development of such tools can be overwhelming. To assist in the design and analysis of long-read sequencing projects, we review the current landscape of available tools and present an online interactive database, long-read-tools.org, to facilitate their browsing. We further focus on the principles of error correction, base modification detection, and long-read transcriptomics analysis and highlight the challenges that remain.\n## Introduction\nLong-read sequencing, or third-generation sequencing, offers a number of advantages over short-read sequencing [1,2]. While short-read sequencers such as Illumina's NovaSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq, and MiSeq instruments [3][4][5]; BGI's MGISEQ and BGISEQ models [6]; or Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent sequencers [7,8] produce reads of up to 600 bases, long-read sequencing technologies routinely generate reads in excess of 10 kb [1]. \n\nShort-read sequencing is cost-effective, accurate, and supported by a wide range of analysis tools and pipelines [9]. However, natural nucleic acid polymers span eight orders of magnitude in length, and sequencing them in short amplified fragments complicates the task of reconstructing and counting the original molecules. Long reads can thus improve de novo assembly, mapping certainty, transcript isoform identification, and detection of structural variants. Furthermore, long-read sequencing of native molecules, both DNA and RNA, eliminates amplification bias while preserving base modifications [10]. These capabilities, together with continuing progress in accuracy, throughput, and cost reduction, have begun to make long-read sequencing an option for a broad range of applications in genomics for model and non-model organisms [2,11]. \n\nTwo technologies currently dominate the long-read sequencing space: Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) singlemolecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing. We henceforth refer to these simply as SMRT and nanopore sequencing. SMRT and nanopore sequencing technologies were commercially released in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and since then have become suitable for an increasing number of applications. The data that these platforms produce differ qualitatively from secondgeneration sequencing, thus necessitating tailored analysis tools. \n\nGiven the broadening interest in long-read sequencing and the fast-paced development of applications and tools, the current review aims to provide a description of the guiding principles of long-read data analysis, a survey of the available tools for different tasks as well as a discussion of the areas in long-read analysis that require improvements.",

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses.",

Han, Alesia Antoine, D. Howard, Bryant Chang, Woo\u2010Sung Chang, Matthew D. Slein, G. Deikus, Sofia Kossida, P. Duroux, M. Lefranc, R. Sebra, M. Smith, I. Fofana\n## Abstract\nThe simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis is critical for furthering our understanding of the role of antibody responses in the prevention of HIV infection, and will only increase in importance as macaque immunoglobulin (IG) gene databases are expanded. We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses.\n## body\nThe screening of this library would be greatly improved with the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as Illumina, however often NGS platforms are limited in the length of the reads (\u2264400 bp), covering at most one VH or VL domain per read. This limitation has been addressed through the use of alternate high throughput NGS platforms such as the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) S5 and the Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) RSII and Sequel systems (40,41).

Oxford Nanopore Sequencing is another well-known technology that analyzes DNA using nanopore technology. To ascertain the DNA sequence, a single-stranded DNA molecule translocates via a nanopore and changes in electrical current are detected.

Methods: A comprehensive review of existing literature on NGS technologies, including first, second, and third-generation sequencing methods, as well as their applications in genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, was conducted alongside radiological imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans. Results: NGS has revolutionized rare disease diagnosis by enabling high-throughput, cost-effective sequencing, facilitating the identification of pathogenic mutations, and advancing personalized medicine. Radiological techniques provide complementary insights into anatomical abnormalities and disease progression. Despite significant advantages, challenges such as data interpretation, cost, and ethical considerations persist. Conclusion: NGS and radiological imaging offer transformative potential in rare disease diagnosis, enhancing our understanding of genetic and anatomical aspects of disorders and enabling targeted therapeutic approaches. Continued technological advancements and integrative analyses with other omics data and imaging findings will further enhance their diagnostic utility.\n## Sequencing in the Third Generation:\nThird-generation sequencing methods represent the cutting edge of advances in DNA sequencing, providing creative fixes to inadequacies in previous generations. Compared to earlier techniques, these technologies enable the examination of substantially bigger DNA fragments by facilitating long-read sequencing. One notable example is PacBio Sequencing, which uses fluorescently tagged nucleotides in a single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) technique to perform long-read sequencing of DNA segments up to many tens of kilobases in length. Oxford Nanopore Sequencing is another well-known technology that analyzes DNA using nanopore technology. To ascertain the DNA sequence, a single-stranded DNA molecule translocates via a nanopore and changes in electrical current are detected. The long-read capabilities, mobility, and real-time analysis capabilities of Oxford Nanopore sequencing set it apart.",

However, some genomic regions that are of high biological interest remain problematic for assembly and data\u2010handling. Three such regions are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), sex\u2010determining regions (SDRs) and the plant self\u2010incompatibility locus (S\u2010locus). Using these as examples, we illustrate the challenges of both assembling and resequencing these highly polymorphic regions and how bioinformatic and technological developments are enabling new approaches to their study. Mapping short\u2010read sequences against multiple alternative references improves genotyping comprehensiveness at the S\u2010locus thereby contributing to more accurate assessments of allelic frequencies. Long\u2010read sequencing, producing reads of several tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in length, facilitates the assembly of such regions as single sequences can span the multiple duplicated gene copies of the MHC region, and sequence through repetitive stretches and translocations in SDRs and S\u2010locus haplotypes. These advances are adding value to short\u2010read genome resequencing approaches by allowing, for example, more accurate haplotype phasing across longer regions. Finally, we assessed further technical improvements, such as nanopore adaptive sequencing and bioinformatic tools using pangenomes, which have the potential to further expand our knowledge of a number of genomic regions that remain challenging to study with classical resequencing approaches.",

                    "text": "Long-read sequencing, also called third generation sequencing, became widely available in 2011, when Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) commercialized the \"single-molecule real-time\" (SMRT) methodology (Amarasinghe et al., 2020;Eid et al., 2009). In 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) followed this by releasing the MinION device, enabling Nanopore sequencing in almost any laboratory. \n\nCurrently, both technologies generate long reads with N50 values of approximately 30 kb (that is: half of the sequencing data consists of reads \u226530 kb). In addition, the ONT platform allows for ultra-long read sequencing with N50s exceeding 100 kb. However, the DNA preparation for generating ultra-long reads can be challenging, especially when working with difficult organisms, with tough cell walls and problematic secondary chemistry, such as xerophytic plants (Schalamun et al., 2019). (Nurk et al., 2020). \n\nFor the assembly of complex genomic regions, PacBio HiFi and ONT ultra-long read sequencing are at present complementary approaches and the optimum technology to use depends on the specific characteristic of the genome of interest. In the case of near-identical large repeats, the longer read length of the ONT platform provides an advantage, while highly repetitive segmental duplications can be better resolved using HiFi data (Nurk et al., 2020). The two methods, taken together, enable genome assemblies of impressive quality, and can generate single contigs representing chromosomes from telomere to telomere, even spanning complex centromeres (Belser et al., 2021;Jain et al., 2018;Miga et al., 2020;Phillippy, 2020). Special interest genomic regions like the MHC-locus (Box 1) and the plant S-locus (Box 3) may be used as a benchmark of the quality of an assembly. Indeed, previous attempts using short-read technology have proven to be ineffective for proper assembly of the S-locus region that is strongly enriched in transposable elements (TEs), even when sequenced from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic libraries (Figure 2a) (Goubet et al., 2012).",

Vekemans, V. Castric, H. Hipperson, Niels A. M\u00fcller, H. Westerdahl, Q. Cronk\n## Abstract\nWhole\u2010genome sequencing of non\u2010model organisms is now widely accessible and has allowed a range of questions in the field of molecular ecology to be investigated with greater power. However, some genomic regions that are of high biological interest remain problematic for assembly and data\u2010handling. Three such regions are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), sex\u2010determining regions (SDRs) and the plant self\u2010incompatibility locus (S\u2010locus). Using these as examples, we illustrate the challenges of both assembling and resequencing these highly polymorphic regions and how bioinformatic and technological developments are enabling new approaches to their study. Mapping short\u2010read sequences against multiple alternative references improves genotyping comprehensiveness at the S\u2010locus thereby contributing to more accurate assessments of allelic frequencies. Long\u2010read sequencing, producing reads of several tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in length, facilitates the assembly of such regions as single sequences can span the multiple duplicated gene copies of the MHC region, and sequence through repetitive stretches and translocations in SDRs and S\u2010locus haplotypes. These advances are adding value to short\u2010read genome resequencing approaches by allowing, for example, more accurate haplotype phasing across longer regions. Finally, we assessed further technical improvements, such as nanopore adaptive sequencing and bioinformatic tools using pangenomes, which have the potential to further expand our knowledge of a number of genomic regions that remain challenging to study with classical resequencing approaches.\n## | Third generation sequencing: long reads, single molecules\nLong-read sequencing, also called third generation sequencing, became widely available in 2011, when Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) commercialized the \"single-molecule real-time\" (SMRT) methodology (Amarasinghe et al., 2020;Eid et al., 2009). In 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) followed this by releasing the MinION device, enabling Nanopore sequencing in almost any laboratory. \n\nCurrently, both technologies generate long reads with N50 values of approximately 30 kb (that is: half of the sequencing data consists of reads \u226530 kb). In addition, the ONT platform allows for ultra-long read sequencing with N50s exceeding 100 kb. However, the DNA preparation for generating ultra-long reads can be challenging, especially when working with difficult organisms, with tough cell walls and problematic secondary chemistry, such as xerophytic plants (Schalamun et al., 2019). (Nurk et al., 2020). \n\nFor the assembly of complex genomic regions, PacBio HiFi and ONT ultra-long read sequencing are at present complementary approaches and the optimum technology to use depends on the specific characteristic of the genome of interest. In the case of near-identical large repeats, the longer read length of the ONT platform provides an advantage, while highly repetitive segmental duplications can be better resolved using HiFi data (Nurk et al., 2020). The two methods, taken together, enable genome assemblies of impressive quality, and can generate single contigs representing chromosomes from telomere to telomere, even spanning complex centromeres (Belser et al., 2021;Jain et al., 2018;Miga et al., 2020;Phillippy, 2020). Special interest genomic regions like the MHC-locus (Box 1) and the plant S-locus (Box 3) may be used as a benchmark of the quality of an assembly. Indeed, previous attempts using short-read technology have proven to be ineffective for proper assembly of the S-locus region that is strongly enriched in transposable elements (TEs), even when sequenced from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic libraries (Figure 2a) (Goubet et al., 2012).",

Although current NGS platforms were not designed with antibody libraries in mind, the technologies are now at a stage where unique sequence insights into all stages of the selection process can be obtained. Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads. We conclude that, with NGS technology evolving at a rapid pace, its importance in the sequence analyses of phage-and other antibody-display libraries is likely to continue to increase.",

            "text": "NGS technologies have been used in combination with phage display in a number of applications. 24,25 While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length 26,27 and signal integrity 16 of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. 28,29 Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. 30 Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123. Mining these two independent libraries enabled the identification of a large and diverse panel of high-quality antibodies.\n\nHemadou et al. demonstrated that the combination of SMRT sequencing with circular consensus adapter ligation allowed the identification of full-length scFvs from an enriched phage display library. By tracking a manually selected clone, they identified its presence in the top 100 of the pool of reads and they were able to determine an accuracy of >99.9% for complete sequences of inserts approaching 1,000 bp. Although this supports the robustness of the combinatorial method, it does not give insights on the functionality and diversity of the scFvs contained in the phage library. 13 Similarly, Han and colleagues used this approach to investigate phage display libraries that had shown high clonality using traditional screening methods and, although they identified several new clones, they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of",

Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.",

            "text": "Display technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process. Phage library diversity can be derived from na\u00efve human B cells, 2 synthetic engineered antibody sequences 3 or from B cell-rich tissue of immunized animals; 4 libraries generated by the latter method are often referred to as immune phage display libraries. Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

            "text": "The crucial steps in the NGS-guided antibody discovery are the fragment generation and library preparation. In our experience, the excision of variable fragments of interest by restriction enzymes (if useful sites are available) has to be preferred over PCR to avoid the loss of relative representativeness of clones and the potential polymerase errors that could generate artefactual sequences [61]. Indeed, although increasing the coverage allows to easily identify co-sequencing errors, the recognition of pre-sequencing polymerase errors that occurred during library preparation is a challenging task [63]. In addition, identification of truncated clones (bearing only VH, or VH with part of VL) has been reported in many studies, presumably due to their biological advantage (discussed in the next sections). To exclude these 'contaminant' clones from analysis, the introduction of a double step of enzymatic restriction to pull out VHs of interest only from full-length scFvs for fragment library preparation, is actually a routinely adopted, suitable option (Figure 2) [33,47]. As an alternative to enzymatic excision, a few nested ultra-high-fidelity PCR cycles can be implemented [57]. \n\nIn recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65].",

            "text": "they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of immune phage display libraries for the identification of functional and diverse scFv fragments. As 5% of the immunoglobulin repertoire in rodents expresses the lambda light chain, we have considered the kappa chain locus only. 31 We analyzed data from two immune libraries against CD160 and CD123 based on HCDR3 abundance within the enriched libraries, and selected clones either based on frequency or phylogenetic distance to allow the isolation of more diverse binders. An interesting observation was that not all clones enriched by phage display panning bound to target antigen, but we observed a success rate of 75% and 81% when we analyzed the most frequent clones prevalent after CD160 and CD123 selection, respectively. This strategy consists of conventional phage display biopanning followed by SMRT sequencing and open source NGS analysis to identify an expansive repertoire of antigen-specific antibody clones, with virtually no screening required. A disadvantage of the system deployed here, relative to second-generation systems such as the Illumina platform, is the far lower sequencing depth obtained. Typically yields of 80,000 reads for a 1 Kb sequence fragment can be generated, as compared to over 5 \u00d7 10 6 reads for Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Clearly, the read depths obtained in our experiments were insufficient to cover the theoretical diversity of a typical phage display library. It is possible to modify the sequencing protocol by sequencing the same prepared library on multiple SMRT cells of the sequencer. As library preparation and instrument run time are a substantial proportion of the sequencing cost, this approach could enable sequencing depth to be increased 10-fold with a modest increase in sequencing costs. For the purpose of this study and using an approach in which libraries are first enriched against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Phage display technology in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) currently is a state-of-the-art method for the enrichment and isolation of monoclonal antibodies from diverse libraries. However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

            "text": "Phage display (88,89) has been widely used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for research and therapeutic purposes (90)(91)(92)(93)(94). While the first HIV-1 bNAbs were isolated from phage libraries (95), single-cell approaches have contributed most of the new bNAbs (96). Nonetheless, both scFvs and fragment antigen binding regions can be displayed on the phage surface and subjected to a selection process known as biopanning. Although NGS has been used to estimate the diversity of antibody phage libraries (97,98), its broader application has been restricted by the insufficient read length to cover both HC and LC in a scFv sequence (>800 bp). It was recently proposed that once this technical barrier is overcome, NGS can be used to directly select functional mAbs from a scFv library (99, 100), rendering a quantitative method for antibody discovery. \n\nHere, we addressed this technical challenge in a case study of the PGT121 lineage. We first characterized three types of antibody libraries constructed from PBMCs of donor-17 using gel electrophoresis (Figure 2A). Two antibody libraries were generated using different PCR methods-multiplex PCR (with gene-specific primers) and 5\u2032-RACE PCR (with single 3\u2032-reverse primers)-and showed bands around 500 and 600 bp, respectively (15). By contrast, the scFv library generated using H/L-overlapping PCR and a large primer set (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), as well as four post-panning libraries, yielded distinctive bands around 900 bp. This comparison highlights the difficulty in sequencing full-length scFv libraries. Previously, we demonstrated an extended read length of 600-700 bp in the unbiased NGS analysis of antibody repertoires using the Ion Torrent PGM and a modified protocol with 1,200 nucleotide flows (15,17,46,101). Can this NGS platform be adapted for sequencing scFvs? To test this possibility, we sequenced the donor-17 scFv libraries on the PGM using an Ion 314v2 chip and 1,500 nucleotide flows (Figure 2B).",

Although short-read platforms have traditionally been used for sequencing most phages, there is a growing adoption of long-read sequencing methods such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio sequencing. An advantage of long-read sequencing is its ability to detect phage DNA modifications, like methylation [76,77], which may play a role in phage resistance and adaptability to microbial communities. While there are over 2,000 phage sequences available in the SRA from Illumina platforms, fewer than 300 phages have been sequenced using longread technologies such as PacBio and Nanopore platforms (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). With the increasing availability of long-read sequencing data and the development of automated tools for identifying methylation in phage genomes with minimal manual intervention, we anticipate the integration of this feature into the workflow as a distinct module. Additionally, alternate codon reassignment, recently identified in phage genomes [39,57,58], is now included in Sphae offering users insights into unique coding adaptions, and insights into coding adaptations relevant to host specificity. Tools like Prfect that predict programmed ribosomal frameshifts producing longer proteins [78], also present an exciting future integration. These enhancements will enable end-users to explore these specialized genome feature, as our understanding of phage biology and evolution improves. The tools and modules within Sphae will be regularly updated to accommodate these advancements to include useful summary reports, ensuring users can easily access and interpret the latest advancements in a user-friendly manner.",

            "text": "Many studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions [57][58][59][60]. Most of the sequencing strategies adopted so far have focused on sequencing only heavy chain complementary determining regions 3 (HCDR3) which is usually the one mostly contributing to binding, thereby disregarding information about other CDRs of heavy (HCDR1, HCDR2) and light (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3) chain domains [57]. The paired-end reads, in part, compensate for the limited length of reads, allowing the Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing.

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing using 454 or Illumina technologies is powerful in covering the totality of the metasecretome library inserts. However, due to the short lengths of templates required for these sequencing technologies and a PCR amplification step that is necessary in order to produce the sequencing library, sequence information is disconnected from the physical recombinant clones from which it was derived (Ciric et al., 2014), making it impossible to form a clone library without the standard Sanger sequencing. This issue, however, can be overcome by using novel sequencing technologies, like PACBio, which use long templates (Fichot and Norman, 2013;Wang et al., 2015) and could, in principle, be used in an approach that would allow tracking of a sequence to the template. This approach for sequencing could be combined with subtractive or normalization methods to enrich the library for the rare recombinant sequences (Gagic et al., 2015), and to build a balanced metasecretome clone bank that can be used as a resource for expression and purification of large number of secretome proteins from a microbial community, by virtue of their display on PPs. \n\nA shot-gun metagenomic phage display libraries in Ff and T7 have potential to provide the widest possible coverage of SecYEG-dependent and -independent secretome proteins for affinity selection against complex or simple targets of interest to identify adhesins, secreted virulence factors or enzymes, whereas the metasecretome libraries provide a good source of data for large scale identification of immunogenic peptides. Amenability of phage display to large-scale, highthroughput screening using NGS and emerging phage display-based methods for enrichment of target genes in metagenomes, indicate that this is just a beginning of wider use of phage display to accelerate target gene discovery in metagenomics.",

Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION is a highly portable and cost-effective third-generation sequencing instrument, but has not been used for Ab repertoire sequencing due to its high error rate (approximately 1/10 bases). Here, we applied nanopore sequencing to single-domain Ab (sdAb) repertoires and phage-displayed sdAb libraries.

            "text": "Simple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.",

In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",

            "text": "NA fragments can be simultaneously determined in parallel using the Illumina platform, giving rise to higher sequencing throughput compared with other sequencing platforms (Morganti et al., 2019;Workflows for RNA Sequencing, 2023).\n\nNanopore sequencing, which serves as the basis for the MinION, GridIOn, and PromethION platforms, was first introduced in 2014 by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Nanopore sequencing can produce short or long reads from native DNA and RNA fragments of any length. Nanopores are very small holes in a membrane that can be created by pore-forming proteins or by non-biological means. The Nanopore sequencing method simultaneously sends an ionic current and a single strand of DNA or RNA through a nanopore. As the ionic current passes through each nucleotide that successively occupies the nanopore, it undergoes disruptions that are unique to the nitrogenous base. The patterns of disruption in the current can be interpreted to identify each base in the DNA or RNA strand that passes through the nanopore. Whereas short-read sequencing technologies such as Illumina require chemical modification or PCR amplification, Nanopore technology is capable of sequencing DNA or RNA without these additional steps, making it a third-generation sequencing technology (Bharagava et al., 2019).\n\nPacBio sequencing, also known as SMRT (single-molecule, realtime) sequencing, was introduced in 2010 and generates full-length cDNA sequences (i.e., long reads) that characterize transcripts of targeted genes or across entire transcriptomes. Long reads generated by PacBio are accurate at the scale of a single molecule because they are generated by a process of circular consensus sequencing, in which the same cDNA is effectively read many times (Eid et al., 2009;Vierra et al., 2021). The comparatively high sensitivity of PacBio can be limited by external factors. For example, PacBio can produce full-length cDNA during the library preparation step; however, it can only generate high-quality reads if the target cDNA is short enough to be sequenced in multiple passes.\n\nEach sequencing technology has inherent advantages and limitations, so no technology is best suited for all types of RNA-seq analysis (Box 1). Short-read technologies can generate data with a lower error rate and higher throughput than",

            "text": "The newly developed NGS workflow is extremely beneficial in the rapid advancement of monoclonal antibody discovery. Direct costs for sequencing through Sanger or PacBio platforms are similar, but the indirect costs (bench scientist time, etc.) are much lower with the NGS platform. The incorporation of the NGS workflow bypassed weeks of hands-on bench work. We were able to start panning immediately for the next set of antigen targets when the first batch was in the NGS sequencing stage. The improved efficiency translated into a three-fold increase in the number of target antigens that we can process per year. Furthermore, the PacBio NGS platform's long-read capability provided us with tens of thousands of sequencing reads, which is impossible to achieve with a traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing. With the power of deep sequencing and deep mining of antibody sequences, we generated many antibodies that would have been likely to be missed by the traditional workflow. Furthermore, with a much larger data set sequence, the NGS approach provided a more accurate antibody frequency ranking, as can be seen in Table 1. \n\nFrom the initial 4.5 \u00d7 10 10 phage library diversity and over 1 \u00d7 10 12 phage particles input for panning, we obtained highly specific antibodies against each of the endemic coronaviruses' spike proteins with high affinity. The output phage at the end of four rounds of panning endured a total of over 60 stringent washes, which guarantees the efficient removal of non-specific binding phages. It is unsurprising that all the tested antibodies identified from the NGS workflow were specific and had high affinity even without the previous ELISA screening used in the traditional workflow. \n\nThe numbering in the antibody ID reflects its frequency ranking among NGS-identified antibodies. There is no correlation between antibody rank and binding strength. In fact, most antibodies with a lower frequency ranking had similar ELISA titration curves compared to higher-ranking antibodies. As seen in Table 3, none of the 229E-neutralizing antibodies contained a second ID from the traditional workflow, indicating that all these neutralizing antibodies were identified from the NGS workflow.",

            "text": "against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have been performed or where a broader view of an immune repertoire is desired, the depth of sequencing may become limiting.\n\nIncreasingly, antibody discovery has become a high throughput empiric endeavor. Antibodies with desired properties, such as receptor agonism or the appropriate binding kinetics, within a population may be rare. Thus, it is often necessary to sample highly diverse populations in order to obtain the antibody of interest. Our library sequencing approach allows the isolation of large numbers of antibodies that have been affinity matured in-vivo and are thus likely to retain excellent specificity and biophysical properties. 32 Single cell screening technologies such as SLAM 33 and microfluidic-based 34 platforms similarly offer an excellent source of in-vivo matured antibodies, but themselves suffer limitations. In B cell binding strategies, screening of the antibody repertoire often requires live cells to be manipulated and sorted for antigen binding, limiting the antibody repertoire to memory B cells that express surface IgG. Microfluidic-based platforms allow the real-time interrogation of plasma cells that secrete IgG, but these technologies are technically complex and require specialized instrumentation. The strategy that we describe is relatively low cost, simple and easily adoptable by most labs while offering a depth and diversity of antigen specific antibodies similar to single cell methods. Single B cell methods have a clear advantage in the native pairing of heavy and light chains, but they are limited to a small numbers of antigen-specific B cell that can be efficiently sorted and recovered before the sequence identification. 15,35 Here we have described a simple method using SMRT sequencing to interrogate diversity from enriched phage display libraries to identify antigen-specific scFvs. The interrogation of the full-length sequences of each clone provides the advantageous information of functionally paired VH-VL selected during the phage display biopanning rounds. A logical next step for this technology will be to incorporate techniques such as single cell emulsion PCR 36 at the library generation stage. Combining these methods will enable the generation and full screening of natively paired heavy and light",

            "text": "Background The newest generation of DNA sequencing technology is highlighted by the ability to sequence reads hundreds of kilobases in length, and the increased availability of long read data has democratized the genome sequencing and assembly process. PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput and per-base accuracy. Released in 2019, the PacBio Sequel II platform advertises substantial enhancements over previous PacBio systems. Results We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by two PacBio platforms (Sequel II and RS II) and two ONT protocols (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. Sequel II assemblies had higher contiguity and consensus accuracy relative to other methods, even after accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT RAPID libraries had the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial genome assemblies or combined ONT and Sequel II libraries for eukaryotic genome assemblies. Genome-wide DNA methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs. Conclusions The ideal choice of long read technology may depend on several factors including the question or hypothesis under examination. No single technology outperformed others in all metrics examined.",

            "text": "We show here that massively parallel sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries during selection with serum antibodies. From a technical standpoint, our data confirm previous studies showing that next generation sequencing can improve the resolution of methods using phage or ribosome display libraries [19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, while most of these studies focused on the discovery of peptide [19,20,21,24] and antibody [22] ligands for various targets, the present report deals with the identification of the antigen regions preferentially targeted by polyclonal responses. Moreover, our library, as well as the one used by Larman et al. [23], contained sequences obtained from natural repertories, while most of the studies cited above used random peptides libraries, whose results are sometimes difficult to interpret particularly when used in conjunction with polyclonal sera. We believe that, particularly for our application and the one described by Larman et al. [23], the use of next generation sequencing may be instrumental not only in increasing the resolution of the assay, but also in moving it from research to clinical laboratories. In this respect, the PROFILER technology, seems amenable to applications in all fields of serology, including the diagnosis of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. Serology has been traditionally concerned with determining the amount of antibodies directed against a chosen antigen. We show here that -by combining the versatility of phage display with the power of next generation sequencing -it is also possible to obtain, in a time frame close to that of traditional serological techniques (i.e. within two days), precise qualitative and quantitative information about the regions of the antigen molecule that are targeted by a serum antibody response. Clearly, future studies will be needed to ascertain whether PROFILER will be useful in diagnostic testing and whether specific immunodominance patterns can be linked to well-defined pathologic features or to vaccine efficacy. \n\nThere is a great need, in vaccine research and diagnostic medicine, for rapid and simple methods to identify B cell epitopes [25]. Moreover, epitope characterization is important in the context of drug design [26].",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized antibody repertoire analysis by enabling massive parallel high-throughput sequencing, providing a detailed view of diverse antibody repertoires [18]. Different NGS platforms, such as Illumina [19], Ion Torrent [20], Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [21], and Oxford Nanopore [22], offer unique advantages in terms of read length, accuracy, and throughput. These technologies have facilitated the identification of rare clones within antibody repertoires and enabled the study of antibody lineage evolution during affinity maturation [23][24][25][26]. Long-read sequencing is particularly important for capturing complete variable regions and characterizing complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with high precision [23]. Furthermore, optimized library preparation protocols, incorporating antibodyspecific amplification, target enrichment, and unique molecular identifiers, have significantly enhanced the efficiency of NGS for antibody analysis [24,26]. Coupled with the development of tailored bioinformatics methods [25], these advancements provide unprecedented depth of analysis, opening new avenues for understanding the complexities of antibody repertoires [27]. Specifically, BCR sequencing, a specialized application of NGS, allows for the detailed analysis of B-cell receptor diversity, including the identification of paired heavy and light chain sequences from individual B cells [23][24][25]. This information is crucial for understanding the antibody repertoire and identifying antibodies with specific binding properties, which can be further developed into therapeutics.",

            "text": "This technique has been successfully applied to sequence rat, mouse, and human antibody transcripts, [9][10][11] including from single B cells. 12 In addition to these complexities of variable region PCR, Sanger sequencing by commercial providers is costly and slow: around US$800 (2 weeks) for the variable regions (V H and V L ) and US$2,000 (4 weeks) for the full-length antibody (variable and constant regions). Even when performing Sanger sequencing in-house, there is still an estimated turnaround time of 5 days and cost of US$70-120 per antibody. 10 Sanger sequencing is further complicated by the potential presence of multiple heavy-and light-chain transcripts in the same cell. An estimated 30% of all hybridomas express more than one productive heavy or light chain. 13 5][16][17] However, these protocols also rely on species-specific primers and generate partial-length reads (up to 600 bp) which require assembly, while the high throughput is not well-suited to monoclonal antibody sequencing for a limited number of cell lines. \n\nLong-read sequencing allows for the full-length sequencing of antibodies, but a relatively high error rate compared with the above short-read sequencing approaches has limited its application in antibody sequencing thus far. 18 PacBio long-read sequencing has been applied to the sequencing of single B cells, 19 phage display libraries, 20,21 and repertoire sequencing, 22 but its high cost makes it difficult to implement routinely. By contrast, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has a much lower capital cost and flexible throughput, with raw-read accuracy having improved in recent years to >95%, enabling its use for the sequencing of phage display outputs. 23 However, the remaining errors in ONT, notably systematic homopolymer errors (insertions/deletions in tracts of >5 identical bases) can lead to frameshifts, complicating translation of nanopore-derived sequences into accurate antibody protein sequences. 24",

            "text": "Antibodies have emerged as the leading class of biotherapeutics, yet traditional screening methods face significant time and resource challenges in identifying lead candidates. Integrating highthroughput sequencing with computational approaches marks a pivotal advancement in antibody discovery, expanding the antibody space to explore. In this context, a major breakthrough has been the full-length sequencing of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) used in in vitro display libraries. However, few tools address the task of annotating the paired heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL), which is the primary advantage of full-scFv sequencing. To address this methodological gap, we introduce Seq2scFv, a novel open-source toolkit designed for analyzing in vitro display libraries from long-read sequencing platforms. Seq2scFv facilitates the identification and thorough characterization of V(D)J recombination in both VH and VL regions. In addition to providing annotated scFvs, translated sequences and numbered chains, Seq2scFv enables linker inference and characterization, sequence encoding with unique identifiers and quantification of identical sequences across selection rounds, thereby simplifying enrichment identification. With its versatile and standalone functionality, we anticipate that the implementation of Seq2scFv tools in antibody discovery pipelines will efficiently expedite the full characterization of display libraries and potentially facilitate the identification of high-affinity antibody candidates.",

While the widespread use of single-cell technologies has allowed V L :V H pairings to be retrieved from in vivo campaigns, 16,17 the issue has only been partially tackled for the commonly-used phage-display technique. Here, researchers are required to chose between read length and sequencing depth.

Both these drawbacks are exacerbated when working in antibody library and phage-display settings, where diversity, throughput and quality-control are adamant. 20,21 It is also likely that this strategy works best in defined-single frameworks, and that more complex samples with multiple V-families may difficult the site-directed mutagenesis process even more.\n\nInversely, our approach leverages existing data related to cluster mapping from Illumina's sequencing files to match forward and reverse reads and concatenate V L and V H in",

Many successful assembly applications of the Pacific Biosciences technology have been reported ranging from small bacterial genomes to large plant and animal genomes. Recently, genome assemblies using Oxford Nanopore MinION data have attracted much attention due to the portability and low cost of this novel sequencing instrument. In this paper, we re-sequenced a well characterized genome, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain using three different platforms: MinION, PacBio and MiSeq. We present a comprehensive metric comparison of assemblies generated by various pipelines and discuss how the platform associated data characteristics affect the assembly quality. With a given read depth of 31X, the assemblies from both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore MinION show excellent continuity and completeness for the 16 nuclear chromosomes, but not for the mitochondrial genome, whose reconstruction still represents a significant challenge.",

In the early 2010s, the introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT), gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications.",

Phages are well suited to form an important part of this solution, particularly with regard to biofilm-associated infections, and approaches to help identify the most promising phages for pharmaceutical or biotechnological exploitation will be vital to the realization of more effective phage-based products.\n\nCurrently, the selection of phages to be used for the development of therapeutic applications is understandably driven by phenotypic characterization and activity against target pathogens, with genetic characterization often a secondary activity primarily used to screen for undesirable genes such as toxins. However, the generation of phage genome sequences is now accessible and affordable, and the increasing range of tools available for analyzing these data mean this aspect of phage characterization should now be viewed as a primary process in the selection of candidate phage for the development of therapeutic products, or other biotechnological applications. Although next generation sequencing technologies generating short reads (such as Illumina platform sequencing) can pose challenges in the correct assembly of some phage genomes, such approaches can still provide useful information regarding phage gene content and broader evolutionary relationships. However, technologies such as single molecule nanopore sequencing can potentially generate genome length reads, and we demonstrate here some of their potential to address many of the current limitations of next generation sequencing for phage genome analysis, related to read length. Furthermore, platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION require no specialist genomics facilities or support to operate, offering the possibility for genome characterization of newly isolated phages to become a much more routine aspect of phage characterization.",

            "text": "Traditionally, antibody display libraries are analyzed by isolation of 10 2 -10 3 clones in combination with Sanger sequencing (5). Although this approach is sufficient to identify dominant clones after selection, or to broadly validate design objectives, the data obtained represent only a limited snapshot of actual library diversity. By contrast, NGS approaches allow for far-greater insights into library diversity by providing up to 10 7 sequences (approximately 10,000-fold more sequences than Sanger sequencing). One of the main challenges in the use of NGS for the analysis of antibody selection systems relates to the size of the encoded genes: the smallest antibody fragments (variable domains) range between 300 and 400 bp in length, while the commonly used scFv and Fab antibody fragment formats range from 700 to 800 bp to over 1,500 bp, respectively. While NGS technologies are particularly well suited for high throughput sequencing of short reads (less than 100 bp), many platforms can nevertheless sequence up to 300-400 bp with reasonable throughput. In particular, Illumina Miseq and Hiseq, 454 GS FLX (instrument discontinued), and Ion Torrent PMG are suited for this task (8,14,15); in addition, PacBio sequencing generates particularly long reads at the cost of reduced read numbers (Table 1) (16). Long sequences can also be generated by using paired-end reads: this method is particularly useful for scFv formats, enabling the sequencing of multiple CDR regions of VH and VL domains. In addition to analysis of longer antibody fragment sequences, some studies have focused on sequencing the relatively short VH CDR3 repertoire only (23) [which forms the center of the antigen binding site and is a major determinant of antigen binding (24)]. \n\nThe use of NGS requires particular attention be paid to sequencing errors (25). DNA amplification inevitably results in polymerase errors, which can be context dependent. Although the error rates of polymerases are generally low (10 \u22125 -10 \u22126 per base), errors will inevitably be present in large NGS datasets that encompass billions of bases.",

            "text": "Phage-display selection of immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from combinatorial libraries is widely used for identifying new antibodies for novel targets. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SM",

The PacBio platform allows for obtaining longer reads, such as the 658-bp COI Folmer fragment and beyond (Hebert et al., 2018). Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform. In contrast to the widely used Illumina sequencing platforms, nanopore sequencing is able to sequence DNA molecules of any length, and as such it can provide a better resolution as longer fragments can be analysed (Johnson et al., 2019). This would allow for the use of a complete 18S marker, or an amplicon combining both 12S and 16S as a single marker. \n\nObviously, for this to be efficient, primer pairs need to be developed that can cover such longer fragments. Compared to Illumina sequencing, the PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms both have a lower raw read accuracy. However, this lower read accuracy can be overcome by the longer fragment length, or by using bioinformatics approaches that generate a consensus sequence from multiple raw reads (Nijland et al, in prep).",

Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput and per-base accuracy. We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by three PacBio protocols (Sequel II CLR, Sequel II HiFi, RS II) and two ONT protocols (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. In both organisms tested, Sequel II assemblies had the highest consensus accuracy, even after accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT and PacBio CLR had the longest reads sequenced compared to PacBio RS II and HiFi, and genome contiguity was highest when assembling these datasets. ONT Rapid Sequencing libraries had the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial genome assembly or polishing eukaryotic genome assemblies, and an ONT-Illumina hybrid approach would be more cost-effective for many users. Genome-wide DNA methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs. The ideal choice of long read technology may depend on several factors including the question or hypothesis under examination. No single technology outperformed others in all metrics examined.",

Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries  were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine. \n\nAs the yield of full-length paired antibody data continues to increase, it is crucial for computational tools to keep pace and provide solutions for large-scale comprehensive characterization of scFvs. Seq2scFv addresses the challenges of characterizing both V-domains in a single read, by combining existing tools for the analysis of single domains (IgBLAST and AntPack) with custom scripts specifically developed to delimit and validate scFvs. Seq2scFv identified, characterized and validated 17,479 scFvs (representing 14,764 unique scFvs). The results, compiled in a single table, encapsulate the extensive characterization of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a wide array of attributes across several categories. This includes identifiers (such as amino acid and nucleotide SEGUIDs), sequence information (paired VH-VL sequences, scFv and linker start and end positions, translation frames, linker annotations), linker sequence evaluation, quality flags (indicating the validity and productivity of the sequences), and specific annotations for heavy and light chains (covering gene loci, stop codons, frameshifts, and germline alignments).",

Being able to sequence millions of DNA molecules at a time in practically only a few days has a major impact on the way selections and their evaluation can be performed. For instance, the diversity of initial libraries can be analyzed, as demonstrated by Pons and co-workers [73]. They have obtained more than one million sequences for their na\u00efve scFv phage display library using Roche/454-pyrosequencing, which has allowed the analysis of immunoglobulin V-gene usage in their library. Furthermore, NGS made it possible to follow the enrichment process of displayed molecules during all rounds of selection. Dias-Neto et al. recently used the Roche/454-pyrosequencing platform to analyze the outcome of in vivo peptide library selections in cancer patients [74]. They additionally evaluated the outcome of the selection by sequencing large numbers of clones by the Sanger method and a comparison of these results with NGS revealed that ~80-95% of all sequences generated by traditional sequencing have also been recovered by NGS. In another recent report, Ravn et al. monitored the enrichment process over multiple rounds of selection with an antibody library in scFv format using the Illumina/Solexa Genome analyzer platform [75]. They could demonstrate that all positive clones identified by classical ELISA conducted at the end of a selection were also recovered by NGS. Yet some highly enriched clones were missed by conventional ELISA-screening but successfully identified by NGS. These clones were subsequently analyzed and found to be badly expressed in E. coli as soluble antibody fragments and hence escaped the ELISA screening. \n\nApplying a phage display library of fragmented human cDNA, Di Niro et al. conducted a proteinprotein interaction screen for the identification of interaction partners of human transglutaminase 2 (TG2) [30].",

            "text": "Identifying antibodies with high affinity and target specificity is crucial for drug discovery and development; however, filtering out antibody candidates with nonspecific or polyspecific binding profiles is also important. In this issue of Cell Reports Methods, Saksena et al. report a computational counterselection method combining deep sequencing and machine learning for identifying nonspecific antibody candidates and demonstrate that it has advantages over more established molecular counterselection methods. \n\nTraditional antibody discovery processes make heavy use of screening platforms, such as phage, yeast, and mammalian display technologies (Parola et al., 2018). These methods link the phenotype and genotype of proteins displayed and allow for rapid selection of large libraries of proteins including antibodies and antibody fragments. For phage display, the platform used in Saksena et al. (2022), the most common type of antibody fragments displayed are single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). Till now, phage display libraries with diversities up to 10 11 sequences have been constructed and used extensively for antibody drug discovery. Traditional discovery by display platforms consist of performing several rounds of selection against target antigens, resulting in a pool of antigenspecific clones that then undergo additional experimental characterization and possibly follow-up engineering (e.g., affinity maturation) to select for therapeutic lead candidates. \n\nIn addition to high affinity to the target, a critical property for any antibody drug candidate is having minimal off-target binding. However, antibodies with offtarget binding may also become enriched and selected through a screening process such as phage display. These polyspecific or nonspecific antibodies have the capacity to bind unrelated antigens and are often linked to non-ideal pharmacokinetic profiles (Ho \u00a8tzel et al., 2012). There has been evidence that suggests nonspecific antibody sequences can be identified through shared features. For example, the VH6 germline family was identified as a source of nonspecific clones derived from a yeast-displayed naive human antibody library (Kelly et al., 2017). Additionally, certain physicochemical properties of amino acids in antibody variable regions have been found to be associated with nonspecific binding (Zhang et al., 2020).",

The power of viromics is exemplified by the study of crAssphage, which was first discovered in viromes in 2014 [45] and has subsequently been found to be the most abundant phage in the human gut and has recently been brought into culture [45][46][47]. However, the use of short-reads is not without limitations. Phages that contain genomic islands and/or have high micro-diversity, such as phages of the ubiquitous Pelagibacterales [48,49], can cause genome fragmentation during assembly [50][51][52][53]. The development of long-read sequencing technologies-most notably Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-offer a solution to such issues. The longer reads are potentially able to span the length of entire phage genomes, overcoming assembly issues resulting from repeat regions and low coverage [50][51][52]. The cost of longer reads is a higher error rate, which can lead to inaccurate CDS prediction [54,55]. \n\nRecently, a Long-Read Linker-Amplified Shotgun Library (LASL) approach was developed that combines LASL library preparation with ONT MinION sequencing [56]. This approach overcame both the requirement for high DNA input for MinION sequencing and associated assembly issues with short-read sequencing. The resulting assembly increased both the number and completeness of phage genomes compared to short-read assemblies [56]. An alternative approach that has utilised long-read sequencing used the ONT GridION platform to obtain entire phage genomes using an amplificationfree approach on high molecular weight DNA [57].

            "text": "One limitation to this approach is the use of short reads (typically 75-300 bp) which requires a complex genome assembly that works well to reconstruct common sequences (ideally a single sequence) but lacks the depth to capture mutations on pieces that fail to align.To address the limitations of NGS, the emergence of third-generation sequencing technologies, exemplified by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), has provided solutions for high-throughput and also long-read sequencing, with PacBio achieving up to 20 kilobase pairs (Kbp) and ONT reaching up to 1 mega base pair (Mbp) read-length limits.This feature facilitates error assessment at the individual molecule level, making them ideal sequencing methods for this research purpose [16].While PacBio offers higher read accuracy compared to ONT, the capital cost of the system required for PacBio sequencing poses challenges for typical biotech labs, limiting accessibility and necessitating the shipment of samples for sequencing.In contrast, the ONT MinION device is comparatively more affordable and remarkably compact.It is compatible with various sequencing techniques, including barcoded, rapid, and ultra-long DNA/RNA sequencing [17].A current limitation for ONT is the higher error rates of nucleotide identification compared to Illumina, however this is partially mitigated by the vast quantity of reads capable from a single sample in Oxford Nanopore sequencing run (10-15 gigabases (Gb) of DNA reads in 48 h on a minion device) [18]; this large amount of independent long sequence reads could enable measurement of population shifts in the number of insertions, deletions, and mutations with statistical certainty.Also, recently a new chemistry kit (LSK114) for ONT was introduced which can sequence a large fragment of DNA input with the read accuracy of more than 99% (30.1% of the reads achieving more than 99% and 98.34% in average) auguring even greater accuracy with future platform improvements [19].Here we demonstrate heterogeneity analysis of amplified gene templates using Oxford Nanopore sequencing and frame its use with quality assessment of amplified templates used in CFE.",

            "text": "Advances in long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), allow the generation of reads, which are tens of kilobases in length at a relatively low cost. Notwithstanding that long-read sequencing is more expensive than short-read sequencing, long-reads can yield more accurate fusion predictions as they can span the full length of transcripts and thus increase mapping accuracy and fusion identification. Long-reads can resolve complex multi-exon isoforms and identify large transcripts, without relying on statistical inference. Mitsuhashi et al. [46] were able to use this advantage for detecting the full-length of the LTR-RBM26 fusion transcript and differentiating between its two splicing isoforms. An additional advantage of long-read transcriptome sequencing is the ability to identify double-hop and bridged fusions [15]. Compared to short-read data, long-read data provide higher precision, although sensitivity is lower [14,47]. \n\nLong-read sequencing overcomes some limitations of shortread technologies and presents unique opportunities for the investigation of fusion RNAs and related alternative splicing and structural rearrangement events. However, long-read sequencing also introduces new challenges. The biggest limitations of longread sequencing platforms are lower throughput compared to short-read platforms and lower per-base accuracy. ONT's firstgeneration sequencers produced long-reads with relatively high error rates (on average 14% per-read for both direct RNA and cDNA sequencing) [48]. As a result, several strategies for error correction were developed [49]. Some use unique molecular identifier-guided error correction [50,51]; however, computational tools, such as isONcorrect, have also shown to be effective [52]. Using isONcorrect, Sahlin and Medvedev [52] obtained a median accuracy of 98.9-99.6%. In recent years, ONT have released new chemistries (e.g. Q20+) and base-calling algorithms to improve the accuracy of raw reads to 99.6%. PacBio also developed approaches to achieve higher accuracy with High Fidelity (HiFi) reads [53][54][55].",

            "text": "The long-read PacBio platform was speculated to be increasingly used to produce finished microbial genome assemblies 4,6 , supported by several recent examples [19][20][21][22][23] and the utility of long-read sequencing for microbial genomes has been reviewed recently 24 . Combined developments of greater sequence output and longer reads, together with the random nature of PacBio errors have facilitated improved de novo assembly outputs. PacBio has the ability to detect DNA base modifications such as 4-methylcytosine (4-mC), 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) or 6-methyladenine (6-mA) 25 . This methylome information can be useful to understand biological processes such as gene expression and to aid development and optimization of transformation protocols [26][27][28] . \n\nExamples of former NGS platforms include Helicos Biosciences 29 , and upcoming platforms include examples such Qiagen-intelligent Biosystems 30 , Oxford Nanopore 31 , and Quantum Biosystems 32 platforms. Oxford Nanopore has released its portable sequencer MinION, and a recent publication describes the nature of data produced 33 . Many of these newer platforms are still in the initial development stages and especially for customized methods for alignment, consensus, variant calling, de novo assembly and scaffolding. During the maturation of these upcoming platforms, evaluations and assessments for sequence data error rates, accuracy, length, output, cost and performance will be critical, as will the development and assessment of bioinformatics tools. Therefore, datasets which contain high-quality data from various generations of sequencing platforms for a single microorganism will be useful for others to test, compare and contrast existing and novel experimental and computational advances and benchmark automated bioinformatics pipelines. \n\nTo facilitate further assessments and tool development for current and future NGS technologies, we report and describe in detail the methods, data and quality measurements for five sequencing technologies used to sequence the biofuel producing Clostridium autoethanogenum genome. This dataset represents three generations of sequencing technologies, and contains six types of data from four NGS platforms; 454 GS FLX, Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent, and PacBio RS-II; and Sanger sequence data.",

            "text": "High throughput screening (HTS) of natural or synthetic antibody libraries is a major step in antibody discovery and engineering efforts. Most methods of HTS are based on dis-play technolo gies w hich utilize a library encoding for scFv or Fab fragments that are displayed on phage, yeast and in some cases by ribosome, bacteria or mammalian cells (1)(2)(3)(4). Current application of these technologies for the design, discovery, engineering and optimization of antibodies relies on se v eral rounds of selection, followed by Sanger sequencing of enriched clones. Sanger sequencing, howe v er, r equir es isolation of individual clones, thus limiting the number of sequences that can be analyzed. As a result, this approach permits characterizing only a handful of clones from the library, limiting the ability to identify potentially interesting clones and gain insight into the contribution of individual positions or variation to binding. Deep parallel sequencing (often r eferr ed to as next-generation sequencing or NGS) allows for the analysis of millions of sequences. Pioneering studies on a ppl ying NGS to phage display scFv libraries demonstra ted tha t it can help to deal with non-specific binding that may dominate the library ( 5 , 6 ). Other studies illustrated the power of NGS in mapping the contribution of each position to binding ( 7 ). \n\nAlthough very useful in HTS-based antibody discovery ( 8 , 9 ), second generation Illumina and Ion Torrent NGS platforms cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read ( 10 ). This shortcoming limits its utility in comprehensi v e monitoring of selection dynamics and in analyzing the contribution of an individual variant or a specific mutation to binding. Specifically, scFvs have an average length of a pproximatel y 800 bp, Fab Fvs are of the same length but usually have a much larger spatial distance on the e xpression v ector. Read length on Illumina MiSeq system does not exceed 300 bp (600 bp when using paired-end reads approach), and IonTorr ent r ead length is a pproximatel y 400 bp. Se v eral approaches may circumvent this challenge.",

            "text": "Long-read sequencing, or third-generation sequencing, offers a number of advantages over short-read sequencing [1,2]. While short-read sequencers such as Illumina's NovaSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq, and MiSeq instruments [3][4][5]; BGI's MGISEQ and BGISEQ models [6]; or Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent sequencers [7,8] produce reads of up to 600 bases, long-read sequencing technologies routinely generate reads in excess of 10 kb [1]. \n\nShort-read sequencing is cost-effective, accurate, and supported by a wide range of analysis tools and pipelines [9]. However, natural nucleic acid polymers span eight orders of magnitude in length, and sequencing them in short amplified fragments complicates the task of reconstructing and counting the original molecules. Long reads can thus improve de novo assembly, mapping certainty, transcript isoform identification, and detection of structural variants. Furthermore, long-read sequencing of native molecules, both DNA and RNA, eliminates amplification bias while preserving base modifications [10]. These capabilities, together with continuing progress in accuracy, throughput, and cost reduction, have begun to make long-read sequencing an option for a broad range of applications in genomics for model and non-model organisms [2,11]. \n\nTwo technologies currently dominate the long-read sequencing space: Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) singlemolecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing. We henceforth refer to these simply as SMRT and nanopore sequencing. SMRT and nanopore sequencing technologies were commercially released in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and since then have become suitable for an increasing number of applications. The data that these platforms produce differ qualitatively from secondgeneration sequencing, thus necessitating tailored analysis tools. \n\nGiven the broadening interest in long-read sequencing and the fast-paced development of applications and tools, the current review aims to provide a description of the guiding principles of long-read data analysis, a survey of the available tools for different tasks as well as a discussion of the areas in long-read analysis that require improvements.",

Although such data is not yet publicly available, future benchmarks may become possible as interest in the field grows, leading to more datasets and potentially demonstrating the broader applicability of Seq2scFv across diverse experimental setups. Lastly, the standalone functionality of Seq2scFv provides researchers with the reassurance of data security and privacy, eliminating the need to share sequences online and mitigating potential intellectual property issues. With its emphasis on rapid processing, robust analysis, and comprehensive annotation, we anticipate that Seq2scFv will accelerate the identification and characterization of lead antibody candidates with enhanced efficiency and accuracy.",

            "text": "Third Generation Sequencing (TGS) emerged more than 5 years ago when Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) commercialized Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing technologies in 2011 1 . Although TGS platforms have significant technical differences, they all generate very long reads (1-100kb) 2-5 , which is distinct from Second Generation Sequencing (SGS). Considering the paired-end information, the main SGS platform Illumina provides 50-600bp information from each DNA fragment; no SGS platforms provide >1000bp, including 454 sequencing, which generates the longest SGS reads (~700bp) 6,7 . Therefore, the short sequencing length limits the applications of SGS to large or complex genomic events, such as gene isoform reconstruction. TGS overcomes these challenging problems via long read lengths.\n\nThe most widely used TGS platforms [PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] developed new biochemistry/biophysics methods to directly capture the very long nucleotide sequences from single DNA molecules. Other emerging TGS platforms (Moleculo 8 and 10X Genomics 9 ) are based on the assembly of short reads from the same DNA molecules to generate synthetic long reads (SLR). Herein, we focus on data features of PacBio and ONT and their applications to transcriptome analysis.\n\nPacBio adopts a similar sequencing-by-synthesis strategy as Illumina sequencing, except PacBio captures a single DNA molecule and Illumina detects augmented signals from a clonal population of amplified DNA fragments. The error rate of raw PacBio data is 13-15%, as the signal-to-noise ratio from single DNA molecules is not high 3 . To increase accuracy, the PacBio platform uses a circular DNA template by ligating hairpin adaptors to both ends of target double-stranded DNA. As the polymerase repeatedly traverses and replicates the circular molecule, the DNA template is sequenced multiple times to generate a continuous long read (CLR). The CLR can be split into multiple reads (\"subreads\") by removing adapter sequences, and multiple subreads generate circular consensus sequence (\"CCS\") reads with higher accuracy. The average length of a CLR is >10kb and up to 60kb,",

Targeted RNA libraries for AGLR2, ROCR2, ROCR3 were also sequenced with Nanopore and/or PacBio long-read sequencing, following previously published protocols 21,50 (Fig. 1b).

Four DNA library replicates were made for Sample A, Sample C (or Sample D for panel ROCR1 instead), and Sample B, for each of the four panels, and four short-read RNA-seq library replicates were made for Samples A, B, C, D, and E, for each of the eight panels (Fig. 1c). Targeted RNA libraries were also made with three panels for Sample A, B, and C, after which each library was split into fractions (F1, F1 + 2, or F3) of different cDNA fragment length distributions.

Although short read sequencing is cost-effective and highly accurate, the presence of low complexity regions in a genome hinders the resolution of contiguous regions using short reads alone. As specialized tools have been developed to process long-read sequencing data (Amarasinghe et al. 2020), complete bacterial genomes are routinely produced with modest coverage (Koren and Phillippy 2015; and the near entirety of eukaryotic chromosomes have been resolved in single contiguous sequences (Kolmogorov et al. 2018;Adams et al. 2020;Logsdon et al. 2020;Michael and VanBuren 2020).\n\nThe industry leaders in long-read sequencing technologies are Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Since the release of the PacBio RS sequencer in 2011 and the ONT MinION sequencer in 2014, improvements in sequencing chemistries and new sequencing platforms have continued to produce longer sequences and higher sequencing throughput, thus decreasing per-base sequencing costs (van Dijk et al. 2018). Most recently, the PacBio Sequel II system advertises the highest throughput out of any of its sequencing platforms and includes two distinct single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing modes: continuous long-read sequencing (CLR) for ultralong reads and circular consensus sequencing (CCS/HiFi) for highly-accurate consensus reads.\n\nBeyond improving genome assemblies, PacBio and ONT sequencing can be used as an alternative to bisulfite sequencing to detect genome-wide DNA methylation. DNA methylation is found across the tree of life and is associated with a wide range of biological functions, including protection of host DNA against endonuclease cleavage, DNA replication, and gene expression (S\u00e1 nchez-Romero et al. 2015). DNA modification events are detected as measurements of DNA polymerase kinetics in PacBio SMRT sequencing (Clark et al. 2012;Lee et al. 2015;Payelleville et al. 2018) and as changes in the ionic current signal in the ONT nanopore (Rand et al. 2017;Simpson et al. 2017).\n\nAlthough long reads can be useful in overcoming potential pitfalls of assembling with short read data alone, there are notable disadvantages of",

            "text": "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018). \n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as Illumina short-read sequencing have revolutionized whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens by increasing throughput exponentially over firstgeneration Sanger sequencing [1]. Additionally, the use of Illumina sequencing that generates reads with lengths ranging from 50 to 300 bp has improved the accuracy of genomes [2]. Despite the great gains, Illumina sequencing produces highly fragmented assemblies [3], which reveals its limitation in unambiguously resolving long repeats present in multiple copies and GC-rich regions. Illumina short reads make genome assembly difficult as theoretical modeling indicates that reducing read lengths from 1000 bp to 100 bp can cause a six-fold or more decrease in contiguity [4]. Genome fragmentation prevents the accurate identification of mobile genetic elements, detection of horizontal gene transfers, and discovery of microbiologically important genes [5], which significantly lowers the informational value of draft-quality genomes. \n\nThe need for sequencing technologies that produce longer reads to overcome the limitations of Illumina sequencing and facilitate the assembly of complete bacterial genomes has resulted in the advent of third-generation sequencing technologies [5]. Oxford Nanopore sequencing is a more recently developed long-read, single-molecule sequencing technology [6], whose read lengths have no theoretical upper limit and can reach up to > 2 million nucleotides [7]. Oxford Nanopore sequencing can generate long reads that span repetitive regions in bacterial genomes, thus resulting in less fragmented or even complete genomes. However, the high error rates of Oxford Nanopore sequencing set a challenge for accurate genomic analyses. \n\nTo overcome the limitations of both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, as well as unlocking their full potential for genome assembly, a hybrid assembly strategy has been developed. Here, Oxford Nanopore long reads can scaffold contigs generated by Illumina short reads to disambiguate regions of the assembly graph that cannot be resolved by Illumina short reads alone, as implemented in assemblers such as MaSuRCA [8], SPAdes [9], and Unicycler [10].",

Long read sequences can span repeat regions and regions of low coverage to improve overall assembly of genomes from both cultured isolates (Wick et al., 2017) and metagenomics (Frank et al., 2016;Driscoll et al., 2017). We also hypothesised that the assembly of long reads using overlap-layout-consensus would be less prone to microdiversityassociated fragmentation of genomes observed in De Bruijn Graph approaches (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2017;Roux et al., 2017). The MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) is a portable, single-molecule genome sequencing instrument which directly senses native, individual DNA fragments by translating disruptions in the current across a membrane as single-stranded DNA passes through a nanopore. Importantly, MinION read lengths are a function of input DNA strand length and thus very long reads (>800 kbp) are obtainable (Jain et al., 2015(Jain et al., , 2018Loman, Quick & Simpson, 2015). Double stranded DNA genomes of bacteriophages ('phages') range from 10 kbp to 617.5 kbp (Mahmoudabadi & Phillips, 2018), therefore, in theory at least, MinION reads are capable of capturing whole dsDNA viral genomes on single reads, negating the need for assembly entirely. However, a significant obstacle in adopting long-read technology for marine metagenomics lies in obtaining the amount of DNA required: Viral DNA extraction from 20 L of seawater often yields an order of magnitude less DNA than the micrograms recommended for efficient long-read sequencing (Jain et al., 2018). Furthermore, both PacBio subreads and Oxford Nanopore reads have high error rates, with the former enriched in insertion errors and the latter enriched in insertion-deletion errors (Weirather et al., 2017). Indel errors shift the reading frame of the DNA sequence and confound gene-calling algorithms, artificially inflating the number of identified stop codons and producing shorter gene calls (Watson, 2018).

            "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

            "text": "Long-read sequencing, also called third generation sequencing, became widely available in 2011, when Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) commercialized the \"single-molecule real-time\" (SMRT) methodology (Amarasinghe et al., 2020;Eid et al., 2009). In 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) followed this by releasing the MinION device, enabling Nanopore sequencing in almost any laboratory. \n\nCurrently, both technologies generate long reads with N50 values of approximately 30 kb (that is: half of the sequencing data consists of reads \u226530 kb). In addition, the ONT platform allows for ultra-long read sequencing with N50s exceeding 100 kb. However, the DNA preparation for generating ultra-long reads can be challenging, especially when working with difficult organisms, with tough cell walls and problematic secondary chemistry, such as xerophytic plants (Schalamun et al., 2019). (Nurk et al., 2020). \n\nFor the assembly of complex genomic regions, PacBio HiFi and ONT ultra-long read sequencing are at present complementary approaches and the optimum technology to use depends on the specific characteristic of the genome of interest. In the case of near-identical large repeats, the longer read length of the ONT platform provides an advantage, while highly repetitive segmental duplications can be better resolved using HiFi data (Nurk et al., 2020). The two methods, taken together, enable genome assemblies of impressive quality, and can generate single contigs representing chromosomes from telomere to telomere, even spanning complex centromeres (Belser et al., 2021;Jain et al., 2018;Miga et al., 2020;Phillippy, 2020). Special interest genomic regions like the MHC-locus (Box 1) and the plant S-locus (Box 3) may be used as a benchmark of the quality of an assembly. Indeed, previous attempts using short-read technology have proven to be ineffective for proper assembly of the S-locus region that is strongly enriched in transposable elements (TEs), even when sequenced from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic libraries (Figure 2a) (Goubet et al., 2012).",

            "text": "To evaluate the genomic characteristics of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, sequencing libraries were created, and reads were generated at both ends of each fragment by sequencing the DNA fragments. The major sequencing platforms used here were Illumina, Thermo Fisher Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore. Since NGS devices only generate relatively short reads or portions of an organism's genome, they are currently unable to provide full genome sequences [17]. \n\nLong-read sequencing technology, exemplified by PacBio's Sequel and Oxford NanoPore's MinION, is useful for decoding DNA sequences over longer stretches. This technology can generate longer reads, enabling more accurate sequencing and the assembly of long DNA sequences, which significantly reduces the number of contigs formed by repetitive sequences within the genome. Long-read sequencing is advantageous for assembling large genomes or interpreting complex gene structures [21]. For instance, it allows for more precise detection and analysis of large structural variations, insertions/deletions of nucleotides, gene duplication events, etc. [18]. Reading long genes with a single read enables the interpretation of sequence continuity. One of the key advantages of long-read sequencing is its ability to assemble genomes of new species without relying on existing reference sequences. This is particularly useful for studying species genome structure or variants that are not yet well characterized [17,38]. However, longer reads tend to have higher error rates, impacting sequence quality [21]. Additionally, long-read sequencing is relatively expensive and time-consuming. \n\nShort-read sequencing technology, represented by Illumina's iSeq 100, MiSeq, and Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent, is advantageous for conducting large-scale sequencing projects because it can generate a substantial amount of sequencing data within a single experiment. It has demonstrated high performance in detecting various genetic variations, such as small-sized gene mutations and singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Moreover, it offers high accuracy and relatively low-cost analysis.",

            "text": "Meanwhile, PacBio provides long reads (several kilobase-pairs) with high consensus accuracy; generally yielding complete bacterial genome sequences. However, high capital costs of PacBio platforms have constrained accessibility to users, who normally access them via commercial/institutional sequencing services. Additionally, requirements of large quantities of high-quality DNA make PacBio sequencing relatively laborious, time-consuming and impractical for some applications. More recently, Oxford Nanopore Technologies launched the MinION portable sequencer, which provides ultra-long reads of as many as two million base-pairs (Payne et al., 2018), requiring simple, rapid and cost-effective DNA library preparation protocols. Nanopore-sequencing has been demonstrated to resolve very-long repetitive regions that not even PacBio-sequencing could resolve (Schmid et al., 2018). However, inaugural high error rates (>30%; currently ~7%) (Greninger et al., 2015, Laver et al., 2015, Goodwin et al., 2015) caused some degree of doubt within the scientific community, although more recent developments and studies have allayed much of the initial skepticism. \n\nResulting from these technological developments, in 2019-06-29, 1,883 genome sequences of S. pyogenes were publicly available in GenBank, of which 195 were complete. However, of those 195, only the complete genome sequences presented in this study represented the type and most important reference strain of the species. \n\nHere, we present the first complete genome sequences of the type strain of S. pyogenes (NCTC 8198 T = CCUG 4207 T ), determined by two different approaches: S. pyogenes NCTC 8198 T completed using only PacBio reads; and S. pyogenes CCUG 4207 T completed by combining Illumina and Oxford Nanopore reads. Both assemblies were identical in length and sequence identity, demonstrating the possibility of surpassing the inherent error rate of the nanopore sequencing technology, by combining Illumina reads and, thus, obtaining an assembly as accurate as the one obtained with the PacBio approach.",

            "text": "The characterization of bacterial species and strains directly from complex microbial samples using amplicon sequencingin which PCR-amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) from complex genetic mixtures are sequencedis still an ongoing challenge in microbiology in part due to short sequencing reads not containing enough information to support highly resolved phylogenetic classification. In recent years, the development of long-read sequencing technologies and concomitant advances in their cost-efficiency and accuracy has brought disruptive change to a variety of important biological applications. Long-read sequencing has largely trivialized the generation of complete and accurate de novo bacterial genomes [26], has expanded and improved the enumeration of transcriptional isoforms [5,37,38] and immune repertoires [8], and has vastly improved the detection and description of structural genetic variation [30]. Long-read sequencing has become increasingly attractive for amplicon sequencing as well [12,21,28]. Long-read amplicon sequencing approaches based on PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies are being developed and deployed in a wide variety of applications (Caskey 2017 [14, 17, 29];), but a combination of error rates, cost, and more limited availability of long-read sequencing capacity continues to impede their widespread application.\n\nSynthetic long-read (SLR) sequencing technologies are appealing because they can leverage inexpensive, accurate, and widely available short-read sequencing platforms such as those from Illumina to generate accurate long-read sequencing data. However, SLR technologies that were previously commercialized by 10x Genomics [40] and Moleculo [27] were not compatible with amplicon sequencing because they assign the same identifier to multiple DNA molecules in the same well/droplet, which is not amenable to reconstructing the sequence of single long molecules. Other SLR methods exist that utilize unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) instead of well/droplet identifiers to tag each DNA molecule with an identifier that can be read by DNA sequencing to identify each molecule, but their chemistries limit their read lengths [9,23] and these methods have not been commercialized.\n\nWe evaluated a new commercially available long-read microbiome sequencing technology that builds upon earlier academic work in SLR sequencing [20,36].

Here, we have used the popular PacBio Iso-Seq protocol, which consists of full-length cDNA enrichment using the Clontech SMARTer kit followed by building single-molecule SMRTbell libraries with specific PacBio linkers that are subsequently sequenced. PacBio reads are typically longer than the full-length cDNA sequence, which means that each molecule can go through several passes of sequencing. The consensus of these passes is called a Read of Insert (RoI), which is the current standard PacBio output. RoIs where both cDNA primers and the poly(A) can be identified are called Full-length (FL) reads, while those that miss any of these tags are deemed non-Full-length (non-FL) reads. PacBio sequencing suffers, however, from a relatively high raw error rate (\u223c15%) (Carneiro et al. 2012) and a lower throughput compared to Illumina. There are several described methods for PacBio error correction and transcript identification. Hybrid error correction methods such as LoRDEC (Salmela and Rivals 2014) and IDP (Au et al. 2013) were the first to appear. While LoRDEC corrects long sequences by traversing paths in de Bruijn graphs representing short-reads, IDP calls transcripts by using a combination of direct detection and prediction with short-reads that involves longread correction by the computationally intensive LSC algorithm and genome alignment (Au et al. 2012). The TAPIS pipeline does not need Illumina reads but performs several rounds of mapping and correction of RoIs on the reference genome, with apparently similar error correction efficiency as a short-read-based method (Abdel-Ghany et al. 2016). Finally, the ToFU PacBio pipeline (Gordon et al. 2015) obtains auto-clusters of FL and non-FL RoIs and then computes a consensus transcript sequence where errors are significantly reduced.

            "text": "There are several sequencing technologies in widespread use that are capable of reading hundreds of thousands to billions of DNA sequences per run (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). The current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see 'Glossary') per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al. 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Eid et al. 2009). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al. 2015;Quick et al. 2015;Hoenen et al. 2016). Hybrid sequencing strategies using both long and short reads leverage the ability of long reads to resolve repetitive DNA regions while benefitting from the high accuracy of short reads, at the expense of additional sequencing, library preparation and data analysis (Madoui et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Addressing these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Single Molecule Real Time sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, have emerged as powerful alternatives to short-read sequencing (Fig. 1; van Dijk et al. 2023). Their extended read lengths can span difficult-to-resolve regions, improving the identification performance of structural variants, as well as improving the identification and phasing of variations in repetitive regions (Fig. 1B). The growth in adoption has mirrored the overall improvements to these platforms: while the initial release of these technologies was plagued by high error rates, high costs, and low throughput, current long-read sequencing platforms have achieved high accuracy and throughput at competitive costs (Kovaka et al. 2023) promoting a variety of new applications. \n\nOne of the most notable examples of the performance of long reads was how in 2022 long-read sequencing was used to produce the first telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assembly of a human genome (Nurk et al. 2022). Compared to previous references, the new T2T reference genome corrected thousands of structural errors and re-vealed >100 Mbp of previously uncharacterized regions of the human genome. Moreover, long reads have been essential to develop population-scale references of structural variations (SVs) in the human population (Ebert et al. 2021;Liao et al. 2023;Mahmoud et al. 2024), as well as to detect novel gene models and epigenetic changes (Gershman et al. 2022;Glinos et al. 2022;Kolmogorov et al. 2023;Kovaka et al. 2024;Stefansson et al. 2024). In addition to its transformative impact on basic sciences, long-read sequencing is emerging as a critical tool in clinical diagnostics.",

            "text": "For genomes that were particularly fragmented (having greater than 250 contigs), we performed additional long-read sequencing (Table S4). We constructed Oxford Nanopore libraries using the ligation sequencing and native barcode ligation kits (Oxford Nanopore, Oxford, United Kingdom). We sequenced the libraries using the MinION system run with software MinKNOW (Oxford Nanopore). We basecalled and demultiplexed reads using ont-Guppy (v3.2.4) and used Porechop (97) (v0.2.4, adapter threshold -90, minimum PHRED quality score = 8, minimum read length = 500 bp) to ensure that the adapters were removed, along with poor-quality reads. We generated summary statistics and summary plots and removed lambda phage reads using NanoPack (98) (nanocomp v1.11.3, nanofilt v2.7.1, nanoget v1.14.0, nanolyse v1.1.3, nanomath v0.23.3, nanoplot v1.31.0, nanostat v1.2.1). After quality control, we combined the long reads with the short (generated by the MiSeq and HiSeq libraries described above) for hybrid assembly. We assembled and analyzed the hybrid assemblies in largely the same way as the short-read assemblies described above, however, replacing SPAdes with Unicycler (99) (v0.4.8, minimum contig length = 500 bp, mode = normal). \n\nWe followed the quality control cutoffs suggested by CheckM and removed two genomes for having contamination higher than 5% and one for having completion less than 90%. We removed two additional genomes as the taxonomic classification was outside the Psychrobacter genus. These accessions were removed from genomic and phenotypic analysis. All further analyses use the 85 accessions which passed all quality control (QC) measures. For a full description of sequencing for each accession, see Table S4. \n\nWe annotated genomes with Prokka and eggNOG-Mapper.",

Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, 25 with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, 26 evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding. 27 Furthermore, the light chain plays a role in specificity, 28 with specific regions influencing the structure of the HCDR3 loop. 29 Therefore, sequencing the entire scFv provides crucial information for identifying better binders. 30 he advent of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing on PacBio platforms has already enabled the identification of antibodies with a diverse range of affinities, epitopes and biophysical characteristics, by leveraging full-length scFvs information in in vitro display libraries. 3,31 urrently, there is a gap in the landscape of antibody annotation methods as not many tools address the annotation of VH and VL in a single read, a requisite for the analysis of full length scFvs. 32 Though IMGT/HighV-Quest 13 does provide a scFv analysis option, it is only provided as a web server and is not open source. Additionally, it limits the V(D)J alignment to IMGT sequences, as it does not provide the option of using custom germline gene databases.",

            "text": "The most widely used platform in DMS studies has been the Illumina HiSeq platforms for their relatively lower error rates compared to the third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio or Nanopore sequencing) and the higher cost-effectiveness (cost/base pair) compared to Illumina MiSeq (Shendure et al., 2017;Pfeiffer et al., 2018). However, the HiSeq platforms have a sequencing read length limitation to 300 nt. This makes the identification of long-range epistatic interactions challenging if the mutated region exceeds the length limit. To overcome this, barcoding genetic variants can be applied, first to associate genetic variants with barcodes using Miseq or PacBio sequencing (Puchta et al., 2016;Starr et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2022) and then to perform deep sequencing of the barcodes using HiSeq. \n\nRecently, UMI-based Nanopore sequencing (Zurek et al., 2020) and new circular consensus sequencing (CCS) method using PacBio (Wenger et al., 2019) were developed to increase the accuracies of long-read sequencing platforms to >99.5% (Zurek et al., 2020;Karst et al., 2021). This suggests that Nanopore or PacBio may completely substitute HiSeq for DMS studies in the future. \n\nExperiment design and library preparation for sequencing are utterly important to obtain high-quality data, regardless of the sequencing platforms used. One should always 1) start with a sufficient number of molecules per variant in each mutant library; 2) have multiple independent biological replicates; and 3) avoid experimental bottlenecks, over-sequencing or under-sequencing. Especially, it is essential not to over-sequence as that would impactfully hinder accurate prediction of the variant frequencies (Faure et al., 2020). Read-depths should not be more than that of total expected molecule numbers before generating sequencing libraries but also need to be sufficiently bigger than the expected unique counts of genetic variants.",

            "text": "Throughout the years, the introduction of high-performance platforms has allowed the easy and low-cost obtention of a very high number of short reads and a novel understanding of genome complexity [139]. \n\nDespite the benefits, the limitations of NGS (or third generation sequencing) spurred the development of alternative technologies in order to reach the technological highpoint of sequencing with reads great in length, accuracy, and the use of native DNA [138,140]. \n\nLong-read technologies, like PacBio (Pacific Biosciences) or Oxford Nanopore Sequencing, can surpass some limitations of short reads, such as the profiling of tandem repetitive sequences [141]. Despite enabling highly accurate genotyping in non-repetitive genomic regions, technologies like short-read Illumina sequencing are not able to provide contiguous de novo genome assemblies, limiting the reconstruction of long stretches of repetitive sequences [142]. By turn, sequencing methods that produce longer read lengths have been shown to support a more accurate assessment of the size of repeated monomers in satellite sequences [143]. With clear chemical and functional differences, the two predominant long-read technologies-henceforth termed PacBio and Nanopore sequencing-have great potential in the study of previously unreachable (peri)centromeric and acrocentric short arm regions s [144]. The different approaches used by each technology affect read length, accuracy, and throughput, establishing distinct limiting factors. For example, the sequencing-by-synthesis principle used by PacBio, often called single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, has a higher accuracy but read lengths that are limited by the lifespan of the polymerase [145], constantly incorporating fluorescently labelled deoxynucleoside triphosphates [144]. In contrast, for Nanopore sequencing, read length limits essentially depend on the ability to obtain unfragmented high-molecular weight (HMW) DNA, whereas accuracy is dependent on the ability of base-calling algorithms to deconvolute the ionic current fluctuations established by the passage of molecules through a pore into a precise identification of the order of nucleotides [142,145].",

            "text": "Most next-generation sequencing protocols used in clinical laboratories start with the controlled fragmentation of the human genome to create 200-500 bp DNA fragments. Following library preparation these fragments are sequenced with shortread lengths of 100-250 bp by Illumina-based platforms. Although short-read lengths enable highly accurate identification of SNVs and small indels, this approach has difficulty with other types of genetic variants like nucleotide repeat expansions, distinguishing regions of high homology, structural variants (including copy neutral) and phasing pathogenic alleles. To overcome these challenges, long-read sequencing technologies have been developed to create read lengths of >10,000 bp (203,204). Having long reads allows for sequencing across challenging genomic regions and may even help unmask novel damaging variants and discover new disease genes (205,206). Two emerging technologies leading the way in this field include single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) and measuring electric currents as nucleic acids pass through a protein nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) (203,204). Clinical laboratories have been reluctant to adopt these technologies in part because they initially had high costs, high error rates for base pair calling (PacBio \u223c15%, Nanopore 5-25%), and unestablished clinical validity (207)(208)(209). However, newer versions of these sequencing platforms have seen improvements in cost and performance such that a case can now be made for laboratories to explore their utility for diagnostic testing. In a research setting this technology can identify clinically relevant structural variants (210-213), sequence entire nucleotide repeat expansions found in genes like HTT, FMR1, and ATXN10 (214-216), bypass pseudogenes affecting IKBKG and CYP2D6 (217, 218), and phase disease alleles (219). Although the studies outlined above provide evidence that challenging genomic regions can be reliably analyzed with long-read technology, an initial long-range PCR to enrich for the target region was often performed limiting the scalability and clinical utility of these methods.",

            "text": "Long-read sequencing technology has proved invaluable to overcome the shortcomings of short read sequencing technology. Moreover, the use of long read sequencing has increased exponentially in recent years and continues to do so (Chaisson et. al. 2015, Goodwin et.al. 2016). However, quantifying in silico the causes of the probabilistically higher rate of sequencing failure in long read sequencing, paired with cost, substantial opportunity remains to improve performance of long read sequencing. It is necessary to have highly reproducible and controllable reference data to which in vitro sequencing results can be compared to identify variables implicated in long read sequencing failure. \n\nOne observable source of failure in long read sequencing is library performance in the instrument (PacBio and Nanopore) after passing all pertinent molecular quality checks. We hypothesize that NGS libraries that fail sequencing contain an abnormally high degree of nicks, resulting in incomplete sequencing (data not shown). Given that long read sequencing remains relatively expensive in terms of both time and resources, failed sequencing runs represent a significant challenge, particularly for genomics core facilities. Therefore, there is substantial need to understand the underlying mechanics of sequencing failure, including whether some nucleotide combinations are more prone to damage than others. To quantify the patterns of nick sites in sequencing libraries, we developed an in silico simulator of both long read sequencing platforms to create an empirical distributions of terminal nucleotides in ideal long read sequencing libraries. \n\nHere, we introduce SiLiCO, the first open source package for in silico simulation of long read sequencing results on both major long read sequencing platforms (Sup. Table 1). SiLiCO simulates both PacBio and, for the first time, Oxford Nanopore read sequencing results by stochastically generating genomic coordinates and extracting corresponding nucleotide sequences from a reference assembly. Futhermore, SiLiCO also is easily scaled up to a Monte-Carlo simulation, affording the end user the ability construct empirical distributions of various genomic features.",

            "text": "Second-generation sequencing (SGS) platforms, such as Illumina, have significant limitations, although they are widely used in bacterial-genome research [1]. First, for a single laboratory, an SGS device requires significant capital investments (about USD 980,000), and the operation of the instrument has strict requirements in terms of the laboratory environment and the operators' skills. Second, the process of SGS sample preparation and library construction is cumbersome. In addition, the sequencing process is time-consuming, and the output lags. Third, SGS platforms are based on PCR amplification for carrying out DNA molecule sequencing. Thus, they are limited by amplification and sequencing bias complications, and the read lengths are restricted to a few hundred bases. Short-read lengths make it difficult to achieve complete de novo assembly for genomes that include longer repetitive elements. The structures of repetitive regions include, for example, resistance gene cassettes, insertion sequences, and transposons. \n\nThe first established long-read technology was that of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), which uses a sequencing-by-synthesis approach [2].

For the PacBio Sequel machine, the average length of reads is in the range of 10-14 kb. The error rate for raw reads is about 13-15%. The throughput can reach up to about 30 Gb per run. However, the cost of genome sequencing with the PacBio technology is still relatively high, as it involves a high initial cost for the platform (about USD 350,000) and about USD 100 per Gb. \n\nThe recent platform of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) delivers the real-time long-read sequencing of individual molecules [3]. It has a distinctive principle: ONT sequencing measures the disruption in ionic current when a single-stranded DNA molecule passes through a nanopore of an electrically resistant yet voltage-applied membrane. The change in ionic current is translated into sequence information in real time by base-calling software. The process of ONT sequencing adopts a PCR-free method to directly sequence genomic DNA molecules (Figure 1).",

Although display methods such as phage display offer high-throughput, affinities of individual antibodies need to be accurately measured in soluble format. We have developed a screening platform capable of providing genotyped functional data from a total of 9216 soluble, individual antigen binding fragment (Fab) clones by employing next-generation sequencing (NGS) with hierarchical indexing. Full-length, paired variable domain sequences (VL\u2013VH) are linked to functional screening data, enabling in-depth analysis of mutation effects. The platform was applied to four phage display-selected scFv/Fab screening projects and one site-saturation VH affinity maturation project. Genotyped functional screening simultaneously enabled the identification of affinity improving mutations in the VH domain of Fab 49A3 recognizing Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) serotype 2 and informed on VH residue positions which cannot be changed from wild-type without decreasing the affinity. Genotype-based identification revealed to us the extent of intraclonal signal variance inherent to single point screening data, a phenomenon often overlooked in the field. Moreover, genotyped screening eliminated the redundant selection of identical genotypes for further study and provided a new analysis tool to evaluate the success of phage display selections and remaining clonal diversity in the screened repertoires.",

            "text": "As sequencing technologies have continued to advance beyond the initial introduction of nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), we have begun to see the emergence of so-called \"third-generation\" sequencing platforms, which seek to improve on the standard short-read sequencing that has thus far been the heart of most next-generation sequencing technologies [1]. Several organizations are at the center of this new sequencing revolution, including Pacific Biosciences [2], Oxford Nanopore [3] and 10x Genomics [4]. While the former two have developed sequencing methods that produce much longer physical reads (e.g., 10-200kb) at typically higher error rates, 10x Genomics' Chromium platform instead generates reads that have long-range information implicit in a read \"barcode,\" a 16bp nucleic acid sequence that can be used to determine the source fragment of a particular read [5]. At a high level, 10x sequencing first organizes long (10-200kb) DNA fragments into droplets such that few are present in each droplet. These fragments are then sheared, and a unique barcoded bead is added to each droplet so as to ligate a 16bp barcode to each sheared piece. These newly-barcoded sheared fragments are then sequenced using standard short-read sequencing, thereby producing barcoded short-reads [4]. Because they help identify the original source fragment, these barcodes implicitly carry long-range information, and can have a significant impact on alignment as well as fundamental downstream analyses such as structural variation detection and phasing. \n\nBarcoded reads have several advantages over physically long reads. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, barcoded short-read sequencing is substantially cheaper than long-read sequencing; whereas PacBio's and Oxford Nanopore's sequencing platforms currently cost anywhere from $750-$1000 per GB of data, 10x sequencing is a comparatively cheap add-on to standard shortread sequencing, and therefore bears the same cost (specifically, $30 per GB) plus a $500 overhead per sample [5].",

SGS platforms generate short-read data, typically ranging from ~50 to 300 base pairs in length and varying in sequencing depth (Ranjan et al., 2016;Johnson et al., 2019). Common third-generation sequencing (TGS) platforms include Helicos Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS), Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) (Schadt et al., 2010;Koren and Phillippy, 2015;Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). SMS enables single-molecule detection without the need for amplification and was one of the early TGS technologies that had potential applications in studying complex microbial communities (Pushkarev et al., 2009). PacBio sequencing is a single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology that offers long-read sequence technology, where long-read data can range from 1,000-20,000 bases or more (Udaondo et al., 2021). This feature is beneficial for resolving complex microbial communities and detecting novel microorganisms. PacBio's Sequel and Sequel II systems have been utilized in various metagenomic studies. ONT sequencing is based on nanopore technology, where DNA molecules pass through a nanopore, generating electrical signals that correspond to the nucleotide sequence. The MinION and PromethION devices from ONT have been used for real-time sequencing of microbial DNA, providing long-read lengths, portability, and potential for direct RNA sequencing. ONT sequencing also produces long-read data, where the read lengths can vary from several thousand base pairs to over a hundred thousand base pairs (Jain et al., 2016;Schmidt et al., 2017).",

[6] To enhance the accuracy of SMRT-based sequencing, Waltensp\u00fcl et al. recently developed a computational error correction workflow that eventually allowed them to use SMRTbased sequencing for the full-length sequencing of a G-protein coupled receptor library (gene length > 1000 bp). [45] Like this, information of mutational linkage was maintained due to the fact that each read covers the full protein gene.\n\nIn addition to the above-outlined accuracy improvements, Schlecht et al. [46] and Kanwar et al. [47] developed methods to increase the throughput of SMRT-based sequencing by up to 5fold. They use protein-encoding libraries of up to 870 bp in length as an example. The throughput enhancement was achieved by concatenating individual library members -either using Gibson assembly or Golden gate assembly -into longer fragments of up to five library members, which are then sequenced together, taking full advantage of the long reads that can be achieved by SMRT-based sequencing.\n\nThese advancements in accuracy and throughput will likely make SMRT-based sequencing a valid method of choice for the validation of protein engineering libraries.",

            "text": "One of the most important products on the therapeutic recombinant protein market is the monoclonal antibody. More than 54 therapeutic antibodies have been approved for various indications, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. 1 Traditionally, therapeutic antibodies have been generated by mouse B-cell hybridoma technology followed by chimerization or humanization. 2 In the past few decades, technologies such as transgenic mice encompassing human antibody gene repertoires, and phage display of antibody libraries, have become available, facilitating the rapid flourishing of therapeutic antibodies in the drug discovery field. 3 Phage display technology frequently allows the creation of libraries containing up to 10 11 different variants, which can be used to screen antibody clones by bio-panning. 4 Despite the development of alternative display technologies such as bacterial display, yeast display and ribosome display, phage display remains the most widely used display technology due to the robustness of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. 5 Several therapeutic antibodies that are currently either approved or in clinical trials have been developed by phage display technology. 6,7 Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has allowed a massive increase in capacity to sequence genomes at relatively low cost and in a short time frame. 8 It has revolutionized multiple aspects of biological research 5 and is also actively being adopted into antibody phage display technology. Several NGS platforms are currently available, with average read lengths of 75-8500 bp and different error rates. 9 The CDR3 sequence of the V H and V L genes has been effectively determined by the MiSeq system; 10 a singledomain antibody gene was successfully determined by the MiSeq system using a 2 \u00d7 250 paired-end module; 11 and the entire V H gene was successfully sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing system. 12 However, sequencing of the entire single-chain variable fragment (scFv) gene, which contains 750-800 bases, could not be achieved using any of these NGS platforms, to the extent of the authors' knowledge. In one study, to obtain the whole scFv gene sequence, HCDR3 sequences were first determined by the MiSeq system; the entire scFv gene was then generated by two-step linker PCR using primers based on the heavy chain complementarity",

            "text": "The subsequent, or third, generation of sequencing technologies tackled long DNA fragments (> 1 kb) by PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) cell technology [18] and Oxford Nanopore MinION [19]. Where short reads use clonal amplification to overcome sequencing error and increase signal, these methods sequence a single molecule at a time. Skipping amplification allows sequencing to continue far longer along the molecule than short-read methods, but leads to a reduction in accuracy. Thus, long reads often require either higher coverage [20] or accurate short reads to correct the long reads [21] to create a highly contiguous assembly. Read length and accuracy improvements have continued from these initial platforms to generate reads of 10-25 kb through PacBio High Fidelity (HiFi -circular consensus sequencing) [22\u2022] and > 300-kb reads for Oxford Nanopore sequencing [23]. Continued improvement of HiFi sequencing has pushed read accuracy above 99% [22,24], and newer plant-specific base calling models have pushed nanopore accuracy > 95%, further strengthening genome accuracy. Long-read incorporation has resolved significant issues plaguing larger, complex genomes, namely generating nonambiguous reads and contigs that are long enough to span structural variants, repetitive regions, and TEs (Figure 2). For example, a gapless watermelon assembly discovered an additional 173 genes located in gap regions of the prior assembly, including two LRR-RLK genes, which play crucial roles in plant development [25\u2022\u2022]. Long-read platforms also have the ability to partially sequence the epigenome and epitranscriptome [10,26].",

These long-read sequencings offer great advantages, including the ability to resolve repeats sequences [19]. \n\nTwo technologies currently dominate the long-read sequencing space: 'Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA)) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequences [20] and 'Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK)) nanopore sequencing (Company history n.d.) which were commercially released in 2011 and 2014, respectively. The SMRT PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) was the first long-read sequencer to be widely used. It is able to detect a single DNA molecule in real-time [21]. SMRT is based on DNA replication, utilizing the detection of released fluorophores as each nucleotide is added in the sequencing process. PacBio's SMRT (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) sequencing enables the real-time detection of nucleotide incorporation events during the elongation of the replicated strand from the non-amplified single-stranded template. The Nanopore from ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) appeared later in 2014, and the Min-Ion (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) model was the first portable sequencer with a weight of only 100 g. The principle is based on a membrane including nanopores (transmembrane proteins), to which a low voltage is applied. The membrane detects the translocation signals, i.e., it acts as a nucleic acid counter by detecting the interruption to the current as they pass through the pore. Nanopore is less expensive than PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). On the other hand, PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) retains the advantage of better sequencing quality. \n\nThis third-generation sequencing has opened exciting avenues in genomics and has become suitable for an increasing number of applications.",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was a breakthrough in molecular biology, providing a cheaper and faster method for sequencing DNA compared to the previous techniques, such as Sanger sequencing [1]. NGS techniques, among which Illumina is the most represented, rely on specific laboratory procedures, specifically DNA fragmentation, DNA end-repair, adapter ligation, surface attachment, and in situ amplification. A huge amount of data is produced, and thanks to bioinformatics analysis, it is possible to detect genetic mutations like single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels [1,2]. NGS is considered a \"short-reading\" approach because it permits the sequencing of short fragments of DNA of 300 bp length (on average), this being its main limitation because it impedes the sequencing of low-complexity and/or GC-rich regions [3]. NGS strongly supports molecular genetics, allowing us to identify many genetic variants and to define the genetic onset of many genetic diseases. However, its limitations impede the study of many genes, which present low-complexity regions, and of specific chromosomal regions, in which massive arrays of tandem repeats predominate [3]. These limitations require developing a new sequencing technique: Third-generation sequencing (TGS). TGS, unlike NGS, comprises long-read sequencing approaches and is represented mainly by Pacific Biotechnology (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore [2,3]. \n\nPacBio works on circular DNA fragments, while Oxford Nanopore works on linear DNA fragments. Moreover, PacBio relies on fluorescently labeled nucleotides for nucleotide detection, while Oxford Nanopore relies on an electronic signal disruption caused by the passage of DNA in a nanopore. The PacBio technique can analyze sequences up to 300 Kb, while Oxford Nanopore can analyze sequences up to 4 Mb. Finally, they can both detect epigenetic modifications. These techniques also have some disadvantages. PacBio is expensive, both in the instrumentation and in the sequencing cost. Moreover, the accuracy of these techniques was originally low, and it did not permit their scalability in a diagnostic setting.",

            "text": "As mentioned before, only the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms have been used for sequencing in the previous chapters. To our knowledge, only few studies have used third-and fourth-generation NGS technologies for a molecular characterization of TNBC, highlighting the need for their optimization for clinical applications. The few TNBC studies in which Pacbio and nanopore sequencing have been used are briefly reported below. \n\nAganezov et al. performed the whole-genome sequencing of SKBR3, a cell line [91], using the Illumina platform, Pacbio sequencing, and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to compare the sequencing efficiency of each method. In addition, the same comparison was performed on organoids from two breast cancer patients obtained from cancer and normal tissues. For all the samples, the analysis showed an excellent accordance of the genetic variants (GVs) detected using the Pacbio and ONT methods, with more than 90% of the GVs being detected by both sequencing techniques. In addition, the long-read methods of Pacbio and ONT detected a large number of GVs missed by the Illumina short-read method. This finding suggests introducing long-read sequencing techniques into routine clinical practice to improve cancer risk assessment, analysis, and treatment. However, the cost of full genomic characterizations using Pacbio and ONT remains significantly higher than that of Illumina sequencing. From the perspective of cost reduction, the study by Aganezov et al. reported the optimal GV detection of long-read methods even at a low average read depth coverage [92]. Unfortunately, this approach may underestimate the heterozygous germline SNPs, which are common in samples from cancer patients [93]. This problem can be circumvented by combining short-read and long-read techniques and continuously reducing the cost of Pacbio nanopore sequencing. \n\nWeirather et al. investigated the possibility of integrating the results of long-read and short-read sequencing methods to allow for a higher precision analysis of fusion genes. This combinatorial method, called IDP-fusion (Isoform Detection and Precision), aims to detect fusion genes, determine fusion sites, and identify fusion isoforms.",

            "text": "NGS has revolutionized the antibody discovery workflow and is routinely implemented now in the screening cascade as it greatly enhances throughput to identify specific enriched antibody phage clones and thereby aid lead selection. As well as assisting the process of original VH/VL pairing from scFv [214] and Fab formats [215], by coupling the CDR DNA sequencing data of initial snapshot sampling of target-specific clones with confirmed functional activity, it is also possible for the researcher to deep-mine those selection outputs that have produced the most diverse functional antibody clones to identifying further related CDR lineages. Furthermore, NGS sampling on a large scale can be undertaken on pools of phage antibody clones to identify clusters of antibody sequences indicating enrichment [32]. These resulting clusters of antibody clones can then be tested for their ability to modulate the target of interest and this potentially enables the retrieval of rare clones that may not have been otherwise detected via the standard screening cascade because entire phage pools can be subjected to sequencing. \n\nWhile NGS generates a huge increase in the number of reads that can be conducted in parallel, these are smaller than full length construct reads produced by Sanger sequencing, but nevertheless, the advantages are speed, cost, and is less labor-intensive, where the full-length antibody sequence can be constructed from the short contiguous reads that overlap. NGS analysis is also routinely applied to the evaluation of the quality of a library, the analysis of changes in heavy chain germline usage, the evaluation of CDR diversity, in particular CDR-H3 composition and length distribution, and is offered as a service by a host of contract research organizations (CROs). \n\nNGS platforms that have been commonly applied to shortread sequencing include the original Illumina (Solexa) system [214], Roche's 454 system [46], which has since been discontinued, the Ion Torrent PMG platform [216], and MiSeq (also an Illumina system) [217]. More recently, the Illumina MiSeq platform was employed to assess the diversity of the sheep immunoglobulin repertoire [218]. NGS methodology has evolved to provide longer read sequencing with high accuracy and is typified by the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore technologies.",

            "text": "To further meet the demand for mass production of peptides and multiplexing, peptide display technologies have emerged as a potential solution.Bacteriophage peptide display technology automatically and efficiently translates a large range of target sequences into peptides and presents them to the external surface with minimal extrinsic processing and as such is ideal for epitope mapping.Most phage display libraries utilize insertion of a small gene fragment as a fusion with a natural coat protein variant, thereby facilitating transcription, translation, and display on the surface.While large full-length proteins up to 50-80kDa can be expressed on the phage-surface, the insertion of small linear peptides allows for minimal bias between different inserted proteins and facilitates rapid and efficient processing when dealing with very large libraries (60).While not used for epitope identification, antibody identification often utilizes high diversity Fab fragment (~25kDa) libraries displayed on phage surfaces (61).In 1990, Scott and Smith developed the idea of using phage display technology to screen for epitopes (62).Later, Smith demonstrated that epitopes displayed on the surface of phages could be recognized and bound by specific antibodies (63).Phage display libraries have been made up to 10 11 pfu/ml in size and can contain thousands of different peptides/proteins (64).Indeed, bacteriophages have been used to display functional SARS-Cov-2 Spike RBDs on the surface, coupled to functional screening, indicating a role for structural conformation of whole protein domains present on the phage surface (65).Additionally, phage-based protein scaffold libraries have already been developed for surface presentation of small proteins (66).This provides hope for utilization of phage-display technologies to display entire protein libraries suitable for epitope mapping.\n\nWith the development of sequencing technology in recent years, Larman et al. were the first to combine phage display, highthroughput DNA oligo synthesis and high-throughput sequencing to invent a more efficient and cost-effective technique called phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) for identifying antigenic epitopes recognized by antibodies in autoimmune diseases (67).",

            "text": "The enrichment of targeted regions within complex next generation sequencing libraries commonly uses biotinylated baits to capture the desired sequences. This method results in high read coverage over the targets and their flanking regions. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently released an USB3.0-interfaced sequencer, the MinION. To date no particular method for enriching MinION libraries has been standardized. Here, using biotinylated PCR-generated baits in a novel approach, we describe a simple and efficient way for multiplexed enrichment of MinION libraries, overcoming technical limitations related with the chemistry of the sequencing-adapters and the length of the DNA fragments. Using Phage Lambda and Escherichia coli as models we selectively enrich for specific targets, significantly increasing the corresponding read-coverage, eliminating unwanted regions. We show that by capturing genomic fragments, which contain the target sequences, we recover reads extending targeted regions and thus can be used for the determination of potentially unknown flanking sequences. By pooling enriched libraries derived from two distinct E. coli strains and analyzing them in parallel, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method in multiplexed format. Crucially we evaluated the optimal bait size for large fragment libraries and we describe for the first time a standardized method for target enrichment in MinION platform.",

            "text": "Despite advances in NGS, structural variants (SVs) are difficult to detect due to the short-read length (usually 100-250 base pair), while long reads (10-20 kb) with third-generation sequencing may improve SV detection. The SVs include large insertions and deletions (at least 50 bp in length), inversions, duplications, translocations, and complex combinations of these mutations 12 . \n\nPacific Biosciences (PacBio; San Diego, CA, USA) developed single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. SMRT sequencing requires 10 \u03bcg of DNA as the input, which sometimes imposes a burden when only a limited amount of DNA is available in small cancers or early-stage cancers. Nanopore-type sequencers (MinION and PromethION) have been developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; Science Park, Oxford, UK). Generally, it is thought that an ONT sequencer can produce longer reads than a PacBio sequencer. In addition, the input DNA requirement is lower for the ONT sequencer than the PacBio sequencer, although approximately 1 \u03bcg of DNA is still required 13 . \n\nHuang and co-workers 14 compared the transcriptome sequenced using the PacBio long-read method and Illumina short-read method for 10 gastric cancer cell lines covering 4 major molecular subtypes (chromosomal-unstable, EBV-positive, genome-stable, and microsatellite-unstable). Using the long-read method, Hung and co-workers identified 60,239 non-redundant full-length transcripts, of which 66.8% were novel compared to the short-read method. Novel isoforms are more likely to be subtype-specific and expressed at lower levels with a larger number of exons or with longer isoform/coding sequence lengths. Huang and co-workers further identified several cancer-associated isoforms, including novel variants of oncogenes. The results are a rich resource for long-read transcriptome analysis with deeper insight into malignancies.",

            "title": "Long-Read Sequencing Revealed an Extensive Transcript Complexity in Herpesviruses",
            "text": "Short-read sequencing (SRS) technologies have revolutionized transcriptome studies because of their high throughput nature, precision, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness. However, this technology faces some limitations, which include difficulties in the assembly of low-complexity nucleic acid stretches, in the identification of multi-spliced transcripts, in distinguishing between overlapping transcripts, and in the detection of multigenic transcripts (Steijger et al., 2013). Long-read sequencing (LRS) can overcome these problems through its greater efficiency in de novo assembly, in identification of RNA isoforms, including length and splice variants, as well as overlapping and polycistronic transcripts. However, this approach has its own limitations, such as a higher insertion/deletion (indel) error rate, along with lower throughput and higher per base sequencing costs. There are currently two LRS techniques available that are capable of sequencing full-length transcripts, the Single Molecule, Real-time sequencing from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). The zero-mode waveguides (ZMW) utilized by PacBio allow for the detection of fluorescent signals emitted during the incorporation of a single labeled nucleotide. The DNA-polymerase, which is fixed to the ZMW, reads the circularized template multiple times. The complete sequence generated from a template is then merged with bioinformatics tools, and as a consequence, the accuracy of the consensus sequence (reads of insert; ROI) is dependent upon the number of passes the polymerase was able to make on the template (Rhoads and Au, 2015). Sequel, the newest platform recently released by PacBio, boasts a much higher throughput than the previous platforms were able to produce (Lin and Liao, 2015). The passive loading of the RSII platform favored reads with lengths of 1-2 kb (Loomis et al., 2013), necessitating size-selection for the extensive characterization of transcriptomes. The Sequel platform has a substantially decreased loading bias compared to its predecessor, and it does not require size-selection (Hon et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Oxford Nanopore (ONT) [6] and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [7] technologies are two leading long-read sequencing platforms, which have been rapidly developed in recent years with continuously decreased costs and continuously improved read length, in comparison to Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. Long-read sequencing techniques can overcome several challenging issues that cannot be solved using shortread sequencing, such as calling long-range haplotypes, identifying variants in complex genomic regions, identifying variants in coding regions for genes with many pseudogenes, sequencing across repetitive regions, phasing distant alleles, and distinguishing highly homologous regions [8]. To date, long-read sequencing techniques have been successfully used to sequence genomes for many species to powerfully resolve various challenging biological problems such as de novo genome assembly [9][10][11][12][13] and SV detection [14][15][16][17][18][19]. However, the per-base accuracy of long reads is much lower with raw basecalling errors of 3-15% [20] compared with short-read data (although HiFi/CCS PacBio reads and Nanopore reads generated by the latest flowcells R10.3 have lower error rates, their error rates can still be much higher than that of short-read data.). The high error rate challenges widely used variant calling methods (such as GATK [1] and FreeBayes [2]), which were previously designed for Illumina short reads and cannot handle reads with higher error rates. It is also worth noting that HiFi reads after circular consensus sequencing (CCS) on PacBio long-read sequencing [21] or similar methods on the Nanopore platform can potentially improve the detection of SNPs/ indels by adapting existing short-read variant callers, due to its much lower per-base error rates. However, HiFi reads would substantially increase sequencing cost given the same base output, so it may be more suitable now for specific application scenarios such as capture-based sequencing or amplicon sequencing.",

            "text": "The two main long-read platforms are PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT). Long-read sequencing is more accurate and sensitive in structural variation and isoform detection [1]. Because it loads full-length cDNA sequences, this technique can capture many full-length transcripts (1-50 kb), including new isoform structural variations. Because reading results do not need to be reassembled, the computational methods for de novo transcriptome analysis are simplified. These methods are also suitable for studies of minor variations, novel assembly, epigenetics, and RNA isoforms [2]. However, the technology features low to medium throughput: currently, only 500,000 to 10 million reads per run (NGS obtains 100-1000 times more reads per run) [182]. Thus, this method requires high throughput to reach the same accuracy in terms of short-scale variations or low-frequency detections. \n\nPacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) can capture the full length of transcripts, thereby presenting an easier and more accurate method for gene annotation, isoform identification, and lncRNA discovery [39]. Due to the large amount of template required for PacBio sequencing, large-volume PCR is performed. cDNA size selection is optional but highly recommended, as PacBio has weak power in detecting short RNA sequences or degraded RNA templates. After PCR end repair and PacBio SMRT-adaptor ligation, longread sequencing is performed [182]. Another advantage of this sequencing approach is the ability to produce extraordinarily long reads (average lengths of 4200 to 8500 bp), which greatly improves the identification of novel transcript structures [7,97,173]. The extremely long reads generated by the PacBio platform are ideal for de novo transcriptome assembly in which the reads are not aligned to a reference transcriptome. Longer reads can facilitate the accurate detection of alternative splice isoforms, which may not be discovered with shorter reads. \n\nThe limitation of lower throughput and higher error rate is most obvious when performing the large-scale differential expression analysis. In these studies, the expression of ncRNA needs to be precisely profiled to attain sufficient statistical power to have confidence in the transcriptome fold changes.",

The most established of these is the Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing platform produced by PacBio. Their current instrument, the PacBio RS II, can generate reads as long as 54kb with an average read length over 10kbp, approximately 50 to 250 times longer than those available from the widely used 2 nd generation Illumina platform [56] (Figure 1). The technology uses a powerful imaging system, called a zero-mode waveguide, to image fluorescently tagged nucleotides as they are incorporated along individual template molecules. Alternatively, Moleculo uses dilution, clonal amplification, and barcoding to sequence long molecules of DNA of up to 8 to 10kbp [Voskoboynik et al., 2013], and Oxford Nanopore detects changes to ion flow as nucleotides pass through a nanopore, achieving reads as long as 10kbp in prototype instruments [Hayden, 2014]. \n\nThe long reads produced by these instruments are an enabling technology for a wide variety of important genomics applications: in de novo genome assembly, the longer reads span more repetitive elements making it possible to assemble more contiguous sequences, up to the assembling complete chromosomes directly from the shotgun sequences. (Figure 2). In genome resequencing, Moleculo reads have been used to phase haplotypes [Kuleshov et al., 2014], and long PacBio reads have been successfully used to resolve complex structural variations [Maron et al., 2013]. In transcriptome analysis, the long reads span more exon junctions, or even entire transcripts, making it possible to resolve individual isoforms of complex genes [Sharon et al., 2013]. \n\nIn a de novo genome assembly, the reads are compared to each other to construct an assembly graph, such as the widely used string graph [Myers, 2005] or de Bruijn graph [Kingsford et al., 2010].",

The first long-read platform that truly allowed sequencing of full-length isoforms in a single read was the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform (Eid et al., 2009), which started to be used for isoform descriptions in 2012. PacBio sequencing works by utilizing a DNA polymerase that is affixed at the bottom of a zero-mode waveguide (ZMW) with a single molecule of DNA as a template. As with earlier sequencing technologies, each of the four DNA nucleotides is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes, and nucleotide incorporation is observed in real time. Many ZMWs are incorporated on a single chip, enabling massive parallelization. Koren et al. (2012) investigated the corn transcriptome using methods of error correction (see later).",

            "text": "long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore hold the potential to transform 16S investigations by offering access to full-length 16S gene sequence reads. When applied to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, these platforms resolve circular consensus sequences (CCS) and unique molecular identifiers (UMI; Callahan et al., 2019;Karst et al., 2021), which are relatively long 16S sequences than typically obtained by Illumina platforms. These longer read 16S sequences provide more information about the genomic composition of each sequenced molecule and are more likely to receive better resolved taxonomic annotations to the level of genus or species Pootakham et al., 2017) and produce phylogenies more similar to those reconstructed using full-length genes (Ragan-Kelley et al., 2013). One limitation of long-read sequencing technologies that has reduced their adoption is concern surrounding their higher sequencing error rates compared to short read technologies. Rapid improvements to these technologies, however, are leading to the development of new informatic solutions targeted at reducing long-read errors. For example, after conducting read filtering and quality control, PacBio (P6-C4 chemistry) can produce sequences with error rates of around 0.03% Wagner et al., 2016). Another potential effect of long-read sequencing is on the improved accuracy of estimates of species richness (Jeong et al., 2021). One study found that MiSeq V1-V2 sequences have elevated species richness estimates compared to PacBio full-length sequences from the same sample . However, when the full-length PacBio sequences were truncated to simulate V1-V2 reads, there was an increase in species diversity indicating that short read sequencing may result in an overestimation of species diversity . In addition, the use of full length sequences including all hypervariable regions, improved classification of the majority of sequences at the species level (Johnson et al., 2019;Jeong et al., 2021).\n\nAs new sequencing platforms are developed and chemistries improve, the per nucleotide error rates resulting from sequencing error will likely decrease. Currently, a large factor in platform selection resides in cost, wherein HiSeq is often the cheapest in per sample cost, followed by MiSeq and then",

Sets of high-confidence tissue-specific peptides along with improved statistical analysis of longer motifs can be undertaken after the sequencing of phage DNA recovered from a large number of tissues, as well as from specific tissue samples recovered by micro-dissection from paraffin-embedded tissues. In fact, largescale sequencing of na\u0131 \u00a8ve (unselected and unamplified) libraries may--for the first time--provide an accurate measurement of their size (i.e., number of unique sequences), a result allowing the empiric (rather than theoretical) demonstration of the true randomness of insert sequences. In this study, it should be noted that we used targeting peptides for validation, but there is no reason that antibodies would not be as effective. Indeed, one might speculate that the DNA-based approaches introduced in this study will eliminate the need for ''helper'' phage for phage antibodydisplay selection, and finally enable its in vivo application. \n\nOne technical aspect merits an additional brief commentary. Next-generation sequencing approaches are being improved constantly, and the newest chemistry platforms [such as SOLiD TM (Applied Biosystems) or Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc.)] may actually permit the generation of .100 million sequencing ''reads'' per run without the inherent challenge of homopolymer sequencing of this pyrosequencing platform. For both sequencing technologies, a major limitation is the short length of possible DNA analytes (,100 nucleotides), which may prove suitable for combinatorial phage libraries (displaying small peptides). Nevertheless, because the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of such methods has not been vetted, it remains to be determined whether other massive sequencing platforms may eventually replace the platform used here. \n\nTechnological advances have already brought about a new era for genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptome studies.",

For instance, in engineering-focused applications, high-throughput mutant data coupled with Sanger sequencing of selected clones can reveal the most common and most consequential mutations. Methods to process sequencing data to obtain higher accuracy at the cost of read depth can also be considered. \n\nHigher accuracy than that of raw reads is achievable by combining multiple independent reads of the same original sequence to form a consensus sequence. This is typically accomplished either through circular consensus or through unique molecular identifier (UMI) consensus sequencing. For circular consensus, a template is circularized prior to amplification, resulting in concatemeric reads containing multiple copies of the original linear template to form a consensus sequence. For UMI consensus, UMIs composed of random DNA barcodes are appended to the template prior to amplification and sequencing, and consensus sequences are derived from reads with the same or similar UMIs. \n\nThese error correction methods allow long-read sequencing platforms to compete in accuracy with short-read sequencing platforms. PacBio is currently the more accessible long-read sequencing platform due to its standardized error correction procedures 98 , but recent examples of error correction methods for ONT sequencing data demonstrate the potential utility of this platform 97,99,100 , particularly considering the relatively low cost of sequencing device ownership, which can facilitate rapid data generation. \n\nHTS data sets can be analysed using freely available tools for the several necessary steps such as demultiplexing (for example, Axe 101 ), alignment (for example, Minimap2 (reF. 102 ))",

            "text": "The use of high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze phage-display results had been proposed as an alternative to Sanger sequencing or biological activity selection protocols. 10 he prevalence of clones is inferred from sequence abundance changes along the selection process. Here we propose a workflow for sequence enrichment analysis after phage-display library panning, based on simple frequency changes. The ATTILA workflow is freely available at GitHub. The use of NGS for the identification of selected phage clones led to the proposal of some, but few automatic workflows. REceptor LIgand Contacts (RELIC) 18 was one of the first software for phage-display analysis, and it enables users to align sequences and find motifs from phage-display experimental results. At present, it is limited by biases associated with the original phage-display technique. MIMOP 19 integrates 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional analyses to predict potential epitopic regions, respectively, performed by MimAlign and MimCons programs. SLiMFinder 20 is a probabilistic method to identify short linear motifs (SLiMs) with a very high level of specificity and a low false discovery rate. It can be applied to solve many problems in this domain, including phage-display library peptides. VDJFasta 6 uses Hide Markov Models to analyze antibody variable domain repertoires. N2GSAb 21 is a tool focused on HCDR3 to find entire clones using a smarty PCR strategy that uses an elegant approach to derive phage clones. However, high-affinity antibodies contain uniquely mutated variable domains that account not only for affinity but also for selectivity and bona fide structural features, both equally important if the aim is to obtain clinical Abs. These subtle amino acid residues' substitution may be lost as a consequence of clonal skewing or CDR3 centered analysis. ImmuneDB 8 both stores and analyzes NGS immune receptor sequencing data by aggregating tools to process raw reads for gene usage, infer clones, aggregate data, and run downstream analyses. DEAL (Diversity Estimator of Antibody Library) 7 is an algorithm to estimate the library complexity.",

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is the preeminent method for protein detection, but isoform-resolved proteomic analysis relies on accurate reference databases that match the sample; neither a subset nor a superset database is ideal. Long-read RNA sequencing (e.g., PacBio or Oxford Nanopore) provides full-length transcripts which can be used to predict full-length protein isoforms. We describe here a long-read proteogenomics approach for integrating sample-matched long-read RNA-seq and MS-based proteomics data to enhance isoform characterization. We introduce a classification scheme for protein isoforms, discover novel protein isoforms, and present the first protein inference algorithm for the direct incorporation of long-read transcriptome data to enable detection of protein isoforms previously intractable to MS-based detection. We have released an open-source Nextflow pipeline that integrates long-read sequencing in a proteomic workflow for isoform-resolved analysis. Our work suggests that the incorporation of long-read sequencing and proteomic data can facilitate improved characterization of human protein isoform diversity. Our first-generation pipeline provides a strong foundation for future development of long-read proteogenomics and its adoption for both basic and translational research.",

            "text": "The development of antibody display technology such as phage (1), ribosome (2), yeast (3), and mammalian display (4) has enabled the rapid selection of binders from diverse libraries. These technologies bypass the use of animals and allow for the enrichment of binders within days to weeks. The power of in vitro selection technologies relies on a direct physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody variable domain genes), allowing for the identification of binders through sequencing of their encoding genes. Multiple rounds of selection are generally required to identify antigen-specific binders, either by binding to a solid support or through cellular sorting (5). In many cases, later rounds of selections tend to be dominated by a handful of clones, which are then further characterized for affinity. Such clonal dominance can reflect genuine selection for high antigen affinity but might also reflect other properties such as superior expression or display. Consequently, clones with superior affinity may be present at low frequency and may not be readily detectable using traditional screening methods such as ELISA (6). \n\nRecent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and computing power over the last decade has led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing and has simplified data analyses (7). Although initially developed for genomics applications, such as whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and epigenetics, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is now increasingly being applied other fields, including to basic and applied immunology. This includes the sequencing of the paired human heavy and light chain repertoire from isolated na\u00efve (8,9) and antigen-specific B-cells (10,11), as well as T-cell receptor (12) and antibody display repertoires (13). While most NGS platforms were originally designed for short reads, technology is evolving rapidly, extending both read length and depth. Here, we review recent advances in NGS technology and key applications to phage display and other in vitro selection technologies.",

After AMP cleanup, a single \"A\" is added to the 3\u2032 end for DNA 3\u2032 end adenylation, preventing blunt-end ligation and preparing for adapter ligation in the next step. Multiple indexed adapters with sequencing flow cell DNA hybridization are attached to the ends of the fragments. DNA fragments with attached adapters are amplified by PCR or similar techniques to create additional libraries. The sample is concentrated to remove excess adapters, erroneous DNA, or other impurities from the PCR, and the library concentration is adjusted. The fragments are primarily extracted at a size of 500 bp during this process. \n\nThe major sequencing platforms used for generating reads at both ends of each fragment in library sequencing are Illumina, Thermo Fisher Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore. Currently, NGS technology cannot produce complete genome sequences; instead, the raw data generated by NGS devices represent relatively short reads that are fragments of the organism's genome. For long-read sequencing, useful platforms include PacBio's Sequel and Oxford Nanopore's MinION devices. Short-read sequencing technologies include Illumina's iSeq 100 and MiSeq as well as Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent. \n\nThese sequencing devices detect signals representing the nucleotide sequence and undergo a conversion into readable nucleotide sequences by a computer. The sequencing analysis process includes quality control measures, and raw data are generated along with quality scores indicating the reliability of sequence analysis for each base pair of reads. This protocol is explained in greater depth in the \"Comparative assessment of detailed techniques using NGS technology for evaluating the genome characteristics of GMOs. \"",

            "text": "Seq2scFv's encoding of sequences also offers a useful solution for future inter-study comparisons. Input reads, nucleotide and amino acid scFvs, are all encoded with a SEGUID, which enables the efficient comparison and identification of identical sequences across panning rounds within the same experiment, or even across different experiments, databases and platforms. Overall, it is a robust feature for tracking and managing antibody data processed with Seq2scFv. \n\nApart from evaluating annotated scFvs, it is also of great interest to evaluate preprocessing statistics to consider the overall experiment quality. The preprocessing statistics acquired prior to Seq2scFv analyses highlight the number of reads discarded at various filtering stages, including quality, adapter removal, and size filtering, enabling researchers to assess the accurate construction of the libraries. Additionally, by examining read length distributions, researchers can identify sequences at unexpected lengths, uncovering potential issues during library preparation, amplification, or the presence of adapter sequences. Moreover, detecting an increase in the frequency of specific length intervals in later panning rounds implies an effective reduction in antibody diversity and a potential enhancement in specificity as selection progresses, validating the panning process. Sharing feedback with the laboratory based on these observations can enhance experimental practices and improve data quality in subsequent experiments. \n\nIn conclusion, Seq2scFv stands as a versatile and accessible toolkit for the analysis of full-length scFvs sequences obtained through long-read sequencing methods. Its open-source nature, free for academic use but subject to a commercial license for commercial purposes, ensures widespread accessibility while addressing proprietary concerns. Notably, the flexibility inherent in Seq2scFv tools enables researchers to customize key parameters such as germline gene databases, numbering schemes, and quality thresholds, thereby tailoring the analytical process to suit specific research objectives. In theory, Seq2scFv should be able to handle scFv sequences generated by any long-read sequencing platform, including newer generations of PacBio sequencers and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as the framework is independent of pre-processing and only requires paired VH-VL sequences in FASTA format.",

            "text": "The current long-read platforms can obtain sequencing reads upwards of 100 kbp-1Mbp + , but it is important to note that the frequency of these reads is significantly lower than that of ~ 20 kbp reads, which is closer to the average read length of both Nanopore and Pacbio platforms 2 . Shorter molecules are favored for getting trapped by a sequencing pore or a SMRT well resulting in a trade-off between read lengths and throughput. As a result, longer molecules in a library contribute to lower sequencing yield. Targeted sequencing on top of this restricts the available number of molecules resulting in wasted throughput. Several groups have overcome this by using CRISPR-Cas based target enrichment methods due to their programmable nature and molecule-length-independence for targeting unlike hybridization-based capture or PCR enrichment 12 . There is continued interest in enrichment methods that are economical facile. \n\nWe report here a new approach, OLAF-Seq, in which the CRISPR-Cas9 editing system is leveraged to perform programmable non-random fragmentation of targets into favorably sized fragments for sequencing on long-read platforms. The sequencing library constructed using these linked-fragments maintains the contiguity of reads through the tandem duplicated sequences at fragment ends and improves the sequencing efficiency of targeted regions. \n\nThe simple lambda phage model was utilized for proof-of-concept experiments. Here, both the contiguity of alignment without gaps as well as fragmentation efficiency were measured. The sequencing library constructed using these fragments maintains the contiguity of reads through the tandem duplicated sequences at fragment ends and improves the sequencing efficiency of targeted regions. Together, this suggests the success of linkedfragmentation protocol in tiling across a genomic stretch. Importantly, sgRNA probes targeting both short and long genes can be combined into a single set easily to generate a single library from a single protocol. \n\nNext, we validated our approach for targeting sequencing the entire gene region including introns, exons, upstream and downstream flanking regions of a large heterogenous cancer gene panel comprising of a mix of long and short genes. Our experiments showed that the long genes were sequenced to an average depth of 34.7\u00d7 and the short genes to an average depth of 23.9x.",

Library preparation for the preparations from strains IMT39173, IMT37083, V641, and 17CS1042 followed the manufacturer's ligation sequencing gDNA protocol with the Native Barcoding Kit 24 V14 (SQK-NBD114.24; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Prior to library preparation, an Agencourt AMPure XP purification step was performed at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. DNA repair and A-overhang generation were carried out in a single step using the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix and the NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), with extended incubation times to improve performance. A second purification step was implemented, enabling a barcoding step prior to adapter ligation. Libraries were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and loaded onto the flow cell (FLO-MIN114; R10.4.1; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). \n\nDue to the low concentration of gDNA from the phage preparation of strain V353, the Rapid Sequencing DNA V14-barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK114.24; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used for library preparation. Similar to the other samples, only one AMPure XP purification step was included prior to library preparation. This protocol omits the initial DNA repair and A-overhang generation steps, as the rapid barcodes are added via transposase activity. Following a subsequent AMPure XP purification, adapters were ligated to the DNA, and the libraries were loaded onto the flow cell. \n\nFor both phage sequencing runs, the Dorado basecaller (version 0.7.2; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used to translate MinION raw reads (POD5) into qualitytagged sequence reads, applying the barcode trimming option with model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup.",

            "text": "Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, barcoded short-read sequencing is substantially cheaper than long-read sequencing; whereas PacBio's and Oxford Nanopore's sequencing platforms currently cost anywhere from $750-$1000 per GB of data, 10x sequencing is a comparatively cheap add-on to standard shortread sequencing, and therefore bears the same cost (specifically, $30 per GB) plus a $500 overhead per sample [5]. Secondly, the error profile of barcoded short-reads is very similar to those of standard short-reads (roughly 0.1% substitution errors), which enables us to augment the tools and algorithms that have been developed for regular short-reads to handle their barcoded counterparts. By contrast, long-read sequencing typically produces high rates of erroneous indels (ranging from 12-13%), which presents a challenge when trying to use preexisting algorithms. \n\nAs with virtually all sequencing data, the first step in the analysis pipeline for barcoded reads is typically alignment. While barcoded reads can in theory be aligned by a standard short-read aligner (e.g, CORA [6], BWA [7], Bowtie2 [8]), this would fail to take advantage of the information provided by the barcodes. An alternative approach given by McCoy et al. is to assemble the reads for each particular barcode, and to treat the result as a single \"synthetic long-read\" [9]. While this works well for technologies like Illumina's TruSeq Synthetic Long-Read platform (formerly Moleculo)-which is similar to 10x sequencing except that source fragments are sequenced with a much higher coverage-the fact that 10x sequencing achieves its coverage not by having high per-droplet coverage, but rather by having many droplets, makes such assembly impractical for 10x data. On the other hand, the fact that TruSeq sequences fragments at high coverage inflates their sequencing costs to be on par with PacBio's and Oxford Nanopore's, whereas 10x circumvents this high cost via shallow fragment sequencing [5].",

            "text": "The surge of shotgun sequencing data and advances in elaborating metagenomics approaches have drastically promoted our understanding of the diversity of microbial life [1]. In particular, genome-resolved metagenomics has been massively employed to unveil the black box of uncultured microbial majority, providing genome-level insights and expanding the tree of life [2] since the first metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed in 2004 [3]. However, even high-quality MAGs could be highly fragmented (worse in complex metagenomes) when assembled using the conventional short-read metagenomics, thus missing crucial genetic information [4]. To bridge the genome gaps, error-prone long reads generated on Nanopore and PacBio platforms were introduced, contributing to the leverage of hybrid (short-and long-read) sequencing strategy and the renaissance of high-contiguity reference-quality genome reconstruction from diverse microbiomes [5][6][7][8][9]. \n\nQuite different from Nanopore sequencing, PacBio sequencing could also generate high-accuracy (> 99%) HiFi reads with sacrificing read length and throughput, resulting in much higher sequencing costs in the metagenome project [10]. While the low entry and sequencing cost facilitates Nanopore sequencing accessible for most research labs, allowing a rapid turnaround time [11,12]. Although Nanopore sequencing has difficulty fully characterizing long homopolymer regions, introducing insertion/deletion errors [13], the continuous improvement of sequencing accuracy, throughput and theoretically unlimited read length empower much more cost-and time-efficient genome reconstruction [14,15]. To take advantage of the improvement of Nanopore platforms, here, we introduce NanoPhase, an open-source package to reconstruct reference-quality genomes efficiently from complex metagenomes and explore the metabolic potential based on the near-complete genomes.",

MinION reads were extracted from FAST5 files using PORETOOLS (Loman & Quinlan, 2014). The sequencing reads for both longread technologies were trimmed and assembled using CANU (Berlin et al., 2015), and CIRCLATOR was used to circularize contigs (Hunt et al., 2015). The assemblies were polished using error-corrected Illumina reads with BOWTIE2, SAMTOOLS and PILON 1.17 (Li et al., 2009;Langmead & Salzberg, 2013;Walker et al., 2014).\n\nPlasmid profiling was performed using an alkaline-lysis method and gel electrophoresis (Moulton et al., 1993;Neale et al., 2013).

            "text": "Beyond the scFv format, different layouts of antibody fragments have also been used to construct phage display libraries, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) or the single domain antibody (sdAb) [29][30][31][32]. Antibody libraries are surveyed by several affinity selection and screening cycles, each one consisting of (1) incubation of the phage repertoire with the target of interest (biopanning); (2) intensive washes; (3) elution; (4) amplification step in E. coli; and 5) extensive ELISA assays to identify specific binders. The molecular baits used in biopanning are usually recombinant proteins or target-expressing cells. Subtractive selection cycles are commonly included in the screening to remove clones recognizing non-target related molecules, i.e., the Fc fragment for Fc-tagged recombinant proteins, or cells not expressing the target of interest (Figure 1) [33]. Phage selection was also developed in vivo by performing selection cycles in living animals; this strategy is properly applied when the target of interest is modified upon in vitro modeling [34,35]. \n\nAdalimumab was the first human monoclonal antibody, isolated by phage display with a \"guided selection\", to be approved for clinical applications in 2002 [36]. This notwithstanding, the phage antibody library selection and screening process is slow, expensive, and often limited by the number of clones that can be tested by binding assays, thus representing a bottleneck to expand the use of mAbs. Emerging technologies are resizing this hurdle, paving the way to an expanded use of this approach. \n\nTo this end, a very significant milestone in antibody discovery by phage display was the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to the screening procedure. The application of NGS in place of standard screening methods, requiring intensive use of ELISA (or other binding assays), has dramatically increased the throughput and decreased the working time of the phage antibody library discovery platform.",

            "text": "RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the leading method for transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression (DGE) [1][2][3]. RNA-Seq can characterize all transcripts over a large dynamic range; quantify terminator efficiency and small RNAs; and measure transcriptional abundance, including operons, whilst being cost-effective [4][5][6]. Having a greater understanding of bacterial gene expression would provide valuable insight into the relationship between genotype and phenotype for diverse microbial functions, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR). \n\nTo date, most RNA-Seq has been based on short-read Illumina sequencing generating read lengths up to 300 bp, and shortread RNA-Seq workflows and computational tools have evolved substantially [2,5]. During library preparation for short-read sequencing, however, RNA is fragmented prior to reverse transcription (RT), potentially resulting in lost information during read mapping and making distinguishing between overlapping transcripts and therefore full-length transcript analysis challenging [7,8]. Recent advances in long-read sequencing, for example from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; hereafter referred to as 'nanopore'), have removed the need for RNA fragmentation thus permitting sequencing of longer transcripts, and improved read-mapping strategies and transcript identification [7,9]. Nanopore RNA-Seq protocols reflect two main approaches. The first is direct sequencing of RNA molecules using the RNA-Seq kit [SQK-RNA002, upgraded to SQK-RNA004 in early 2024 for compatibility with the latest Early Access program RNA (FLO-MIN004RA) flow cell] [7,8,10]. The second incorporates cDNA synthesis allowing enrichment of full-length sequenced transcripts [7]. For cDNA sequencing, nanopore offers two kits -a direct cDNA sequencing kit (SQK-DCS109, evaluated in this study and hereafter referred to as the 'direct' kit; replaced by SQK-LSK114 in mid-June 2023) and a kit which includes a cDNA PCR-based amplification step (SQK-PCB111.24,",

            "text": "The characterization of bacterial species and strains directly from complex microbial samples using amplicon sequencingin which PCR-amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) from complex genetic mixtures are sequencedis still an ongoing challenge in microbiology in part due to short sequencing reads not containing enough information to support highly resolved phylogenetic classification. In recent years, the development of long-read sequencing technologies and concomitant advances in their cost-efficiency and accuracy has brought disruptive change to a variety of important biological applications. Long-read sequencing has largely trivialized the generation of complete and accurate de novo bacterial genomes [26], has expanded and improved the enumeration of transcriptional isoforms [5,37,38] and immune repertoires [8], and has vastly improved the detection and description of structural genetic variation [30]. Long-read sequencing has become increasingly attractive for amplicon sequencing as well [12,21,28]. Long-read amplicon sequencing approaches based on PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies are being developed and deployed in a wide variety of applications (Caskey 2017 [14, 17, 29];), but a combination of error rates, cost, and more limited availability of long-read sequencing capacity continues to impede their widespread application. \n\nSynthetic long-read (SLR) sequencing technologies are appealing because they can leverage inexpensive, accurate, and widely available short-read sequencing platforms such as those from Illumina to generate accurate long-read sequencing data. However, SLR technologies that were previously commercialized by 10x Genomics [40] and Moleculo [27] were not compatible with amplicon sequencing because they assign the same identifier to multiple DNA molecules in the same well/droplet, which is not amenable to reconstructing the sequence of single long molecules. Other SLR methods exist that utilize unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) instead of well/droplet identifiers to tag each DNA molecule with an identifier that can be read by DNA sequencing to identify each molecule, but their chemistries limit their read lengths [9,23] and these methods have not been commercialized. \n\nWe evaluated a new commercially available long-read microbiome sequencing technology that builds upon earlier academic work in SLR sequencing [20,36].",

            "text": "Furthermore, when combined with other techniques, such as Illumina sequencing, PacBio sequencing allows for the assembly of complete bacterial genomes with enhanced accuracy [30]. It is worth noting that PacBio sequencing exhibits higher raw error rates when compared to short-read sequencing platforms like Illumina. To attain a similar level of precision, error correction methods are often necessary, making it a challenge. Despite cost reductions, PacBio sequencing may still be relatively expensive, particularly for large-scale applications. \n\nOxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), based in Oxford, UK, introduced its sequencing method in 2014 when it launched the MinION device. This technology generates long reads by employing nanopores embedded in a membrane, through which an ionic current flows [31]. In this approach, an electric field forces single-stranded molecules through a nanopore with a diameter of 2 nm, leading to the generation of distinct electric signals [32]. Since the length of nanopore reads is theoretically determined solely by the length of the DNA molecules being sequenced, if the DNA template is of sufficient quality, it should possible to obtain extremely long reads, covering hundreds of thousands of bases [27]. These long reads are particularly advantageous for resolving complex genomic regions, such as repetitive sequences and structural variants, and characterising mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids. Nanopore sequencing also enables direct RNA sequencing and provides real-time data acquisition, facilitating the monitoring of the sequencing process. These features are highly beneficial for rapid insights, including pathogen detection and identification. Similar to PacBio sequencing, nanopore sequencing can detect DNA and RNA modifications, such as methylations, which are crucial for epigenetic studies. To date, one of the primary challenges associated with ONT's technology has been its relatively high basecalling error rate. Even with the recent introduction of basecallers based on deep learning algorithms, the error rate has decreased to a median value of approximately 5% [33]. Nanopore sequencing can be enhanced through the incorporation of complementary short-read data for error correction, particularly in regions with high GC content or repetitive sequences.",

Since the design of this experiment, ONT have begun distribution of the R10.3 nanopore which can currently only be used with the LIG protocol but advertises to improve consensus accuracy to over 99.99%. New Sequel II sequencing chemistry released by PacBio claims to improve performance, including the reduction of baseline DNA modification scores. The increased use of long-read sequencing data has spurred a plethora of bioinformatic tools for long read overlap detection, contig assembly, and error correction (Chu et al. 2016;Sedlazeck et al. 2018;Fu et al. 2019). Platform-specific tools have been developed to achieve optimal results given the underlying features of long read data (e.g., Arrow and Nanopolish used for polishing genomes using PacBio and ONT data, respectively). While it is possible that improved results could have been obtained in this study by using platformspecific tools, we chose tools for the study on the basis of (1) their wide usage in long read genome assembly and (2) their platform independence. Nevertheless, it is possible that the tools with the specified parameters are better able to handle the error profile of data from a specific platform, leading to the observation of superior performance in many of our tests.",

            "text": "In this report, we present OLAF-Seq, a novel strategy to construct a long-read sequencing library such that adjacent fragments are linked with end-terminal duplications. We use the CRISPR-Cas9 nickase enzyme and a pool of multiple sgRNAs to perform non-random fragmentation of targeted long DNA molecules (>\u2009300kb) into smaller library-sized fragments (about 20 kbp) in a manner so as to retain physical linkage information (up to 1000 bp) between adjacent fragments. DNA molecules targeted for fragmentation are preferentially ligated with adaptors for sequencing, so this method can enrich targeted regions while taking advantage of the long-read sequencing platforms. This enables the sequencing of target regions with significantly lower total coverage, and the genome sequence within linker regions provides information for assembly and phasing. We demonstrated the validity and efficacy of the method first using phage and then by sequencing a panel of 100 full-length cancer-related genes (including both exons and introns) in the human genome. When the designed linkers contained heterozygous genetic variants, long haplotypes could be established. This sequencing strategy can be readily applied in both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms for both long and short genes with an easy protocol. This economically viable approach is useful for targeted enrichment of hundreds of target genomic regions and where long no-gap contigs need deep sequencing.",

Default parameter settings were applied for software analyses throughout this study. \n\nFor long-read sequencing, short genomic fragments were removed using a shortread eliminator kit (Circulomics). Sequencing was performed using a GridION X5 sequencer (ONT). Unfragmented genomic DNA (1 g) was used for library construction with a ligation sequencing kit (ONT). The library was then analyzed in a FLO-MIN106 R9.41 flow cell (ONT) for 12 h. Base calling was conducted using Guppy v.3.0.3 to generate 140,887 reads (2.09 Gb) and 467,442 reads (2.87 Gb), with average lengths of 14,800 bases (longest read, 269,105 bases; N 50 , 37,152 bases) and 6,143 bases (longest read, 156,140 bases; N 50 , 20,011 bases) for AA2-13 and AA3-38, respectively. The raw read data were filtered (average Phred quality values, \u03fe8.0) using NanoFilt v.2.3.0 (11). \n\nThe hybrid assembly of long-and short-read data was conducted using Unicycler v.0.4.4 (12), followed by final polishing with Pilon v.1.23 (13). For both strains, a single circular chromosome was generated.",

The DNA was mechanically sheared with Covaris and converted to a sequence-ready library using the TruSeq DNA Nano Library Kit (Illumina, USA ).

The sample was sequenced on two lanes of an SP flowcell with a read length of 2\u00d7150 bp in paired-end format, which generated 311 GB of data, resulting in an estimated 92x coverage. For Nanopore sequencing, two libraries were prepared using the Ultra-Long Sequencing Kit (SQK-ULK001) and its recommended protocol from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). 30 \u00b5g of uHMW gDNA was used as input for each library. A PromethION flow cell (FLO-PRO002) was primed and prepared according to the same protocol and 75 \u00b5l of a sequencing library was loaded. 24 hours after the first sequencing run, a nuclease flush and priming step were performed according to the protocol, and an additional 75 \u00b5l of library was loaded before starting another sequencing run. This process was repeated until each library was loaded three times. Basecalling was performed using Guppy v5.1.13 with the super-accurate basecalling model.

However, the short read lengths lack the information needed for whole transcript assembly, and therefore it is difficult to identify the alternative TSSs, TESs, and splice isoforms. Long-read sequencing platforms developed by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) brought the possibility of sequencing full-length cDNA and RNA molecules at the price of a lower throughput and higher sequencing error rates, especially in the ONT approach (Laver et al., 2015;Rhoads and Au, 2015). Long-read sequencing is superior to the short-read method for determining 5 and 3 UTR variants, splice isoforms, long noncoding transcripts, while they are especially effective for the detection of overlapping and embedded transcripts (Irimia et al., 2014;Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2016Tomb\u00e1cz et al., , 2017bBal\u00e1zs et al., 2017). Although the ONT technique works with a high error rate, this does not a present a major problem in the case of high coverage and for wellannotated genomes. The major advantage of the ONT platform is that it can read nucleic acid sequences within the range of 200-800 bp, for which the PacBio and Illumina platforms are insensitive. Additionally, the ONT platform can be used for direct RNA sequencing that preserves read orientation and allows the detection of RNA modifications (Smith et al., in review).\n\nSingle-molecule sequencing approaches allow the reliable analysis of the expression dynamics of the viral genes and the total genome by inferring the relative amount of transcripts from the sequencing data (Oikonomopoulos et al., 2016;Tomb\u00e1cz et al., 2017a). PacBio reads have a shorter mean length than ONT reads but the former technique has an 11.7-fold higher sequencing accuracy.\n\nBesides the above-mentioned innate drawbacks of nextgeneration sequencing, library preparation itself can also give rise to artifacts. The 5 truncated reads can be a result of RNA degradation or incomplete reverse transcription, which impede the identification of TSSs. The tendency of the reverse transcriptase enzyme",

            "text": "Another technology for single-molecular real-time long read sequencing is nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom), which is often compared with the PacBio sequencing platform [45] . As the throughput of PacBio RS II has been somewhat limited and its running costs has been so high, many smaller laboratories have not been able to take advantage of this instrument. In 2014, the first device of a nanopore sequencer (the MinION) became available, and was immediately attractive to smaller laboratories due to its low costs and small size. Unlike other platforms, nanopore sequencers do not use base synthesis reaction in the sequencing process, which differs fundamentally from other sequencing technologies including PacBio sequencing. Instead, nanopore sequencers directly detect the sequence of the nucleotides composing a native single stranded DNA molecule via changes in electronic voltage as it passes through a protein pore. \n\nThis sequencing process generates 1D and 2D reads in which both \"1D\" strands can be aligned to create a consensus sequence \"2D\" read. The 1D raw reads have error rates of more than 10%, similar to PacBio raw reads. Although the error rates of 2D reads are somewhat improved, these are still higher than the consensus reads generated by PacBio sequencing. As a methodology for error correction of nanopore sequencing platform has not yet been established [46] , its utility to detect SNVs in viral genome is limited in its current form. One group recently used nanopore sequencing to detect HCV genomes in patient sera and demonstrated that despite an error rate as high as 20%, genotypes could still be determined. Despite these limitations, nanopore sequencing is expected to be used for clinical sequencing in the future because of its low costs, USB power requirements, handheld use, and real-time processing capacity. Thus, not only improvements of instruments but also establishment of bioinformatic error correction methods is expected.",

            "text": "The major challenge is isolating target-specific VHH antibodies through conventional screening of phage libraries, using phage ELISA or phage-binding analysis. Conventional screening requires the use of thousands of library clones and generates a monoclonal phage for binding analysis, which is very laborious, time-consuming, and expensive [17]. In addition, hetero-immunized library genes could be stimulated by multiple responses, due to shared antigenic determinants, with multiple VHH antibodies [18]. To isolate mono-specific antibodies, comparative binding analysis is necessary. Therefore, we searched for an alternative antibody screening strategy and found that a high-throughput sequencing-based strategy is an ideal approach for screening antibody candidates from a diverse gene library using machine-learning informatics. High-throughput sequencing via next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for analyzing a large number of DNA sequences with many evolutionary aspects of phage libraries within a short time frame, including the identification of unique and/or low-frequency rare clones that could be missed by conventional isolation techniques [14,19,20]. In principle, NGS-generated reads are used to determine the enrichment folds of each sequence by comparing them before and after panning of the phage library. High amplification folds indicated that the number of identified reads had increased compared to the number in the previous selection rounds. Diversified NGS-generated sequences can be grouped according to evolutionary relationships by a phylogenetic tree that provides a highly homologous cluster of genes derived from one or a group of species [21,22]. The phylogenetic tree-generated cluster would contain homologous character populations that share a recent common ancestor. Based on this principle, we searched monoclonal VHH antibodies from multiple tumor cells immunized phage display library. \n\nIn the current study, we aimed to develop a tumor-specific VHH antibody screening method to screen multiple tumor cell-immunized libraries, using high-throughput sequencing, which will help us to identify antibody candidates.",

            "text": "The main platforms currently in use for long-read sequencing are Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [60,100,101]. A detailed description of these methods is beyond the scope of this review. In brief, ONT sequencing involves long strands of DNA driven through a membrane pore, thereby perturbing a current. The current perturbation is specific to the nucleotide passing through the pore, enabling sequence detection. PacBio uses a single molecule real-time (SMRT) approach; a long, double-stranded DNA fragment is circularized using a special adaptor, and a complementary strand is synthesized using fluorescently labeled nucleotides. The addition of each complementary nucleotide is recorded in real-time by a specialized camera and individual fluorescence signatures for each nucleotide allow the sequence to be registered. \n\nThe greatest shortcoming of long-read technologies is their relatively high level of inaccuracy, including INDELs and substitutions [102]. ONT and, to a lesser extent, PacBio reads can struggle with homopolymeric sequences. However, both technologies consistently release new chemistry, sequencers, and informatics approaches, and both companies now claim read accuracy in excess of 99% [103,104]. \n\nPacBio accuracy has traditionally been the most accurate longread technique and has improved significantly with the introduction of circular consensus sequencing [G], where multiple rounds of sequencing of the same sample DNA molecule generate a high fidelity or 'HiFi' read [105,106]. Each pass of the polymerase creates a 'subread' which may contain random errors; however, as subreads with differing errors are then combined into a consensus read, the number of random errors is reduced. The latest PacBio hardware, the so-called 'Revio' system, combines HiFi reads with DeepConsensus from Google Health, a machine learning tool which uses an encoder to further improve accuracy [107]. Separately, significant improvements in informatics, hardware, and chemistry for ONT deliver more accurate sequencing.",

Studies have compared long-read sequencing methods [47,48], with the 'best' method often use-case dependent [49]. Basecalling errors across Nanopore platforms and basecallers (not observed with PacBio) have been detected due to the repetitive nature of telomere repeats; however, a selective telomere-focused basecalling method has resolved such basecalling errors [37]. Oxford Nanopore has strengths in flexibility in scale and portability. For ultra-long telomeres, TCA or STAR may be more appropriate as even long-read sequencing reads (typically 20 to 30 kilobases in length) may not be long enough to span the entire telomere [46]. Combining sequencing methods can overcome biases and errors [50]. With the rate at which long-range sequencing is advancing [51], higher throughput coupled with better accuracy and refined pipelines, at a reduced cost, holds potential to transform the telomere field.",

            "text": "Since the first high-throughput sequencing machines in the early 2000s, the machines have never stopped evolving. For each new generation, companies offer a better sequencing depth or longer read lengths at lower costs. Bacteriology, whether for fundamental or clinical purposes, has greatly benefited from these technological advances, with genomics as a central approach. \n\nThe huge amount of data generated remains a challenge, and the support of powerful bioinformatics tools is necessary to face it. New bioinformatics tools make the evaluation of the results produced less complex by presenting summaries that are accessible to nonspecialists. Similarly, new computing technologies related to storage or calculation can help to manipulate the data. Recent cloud systems now allow storage or long computations on remote servers without the need to invest in expensive local solutions. \n\nLong-read sequencers have appeared more recently. These technologies have solved bottlenecks due to short fragments that limited, for example, the reliable and complete reconstruction of genomes. Complex and repetitive regions of the genome can be partially or in totality solved. De novo genome assemblies have thus been facilitated. Genomes sequenced with long reads better reflect reality, resulting in the greatly improved reliability of genomic studies aimed at the evolution of pathogens, drug resistance or genetic diversity such as that due to structural variants. \n\nThese long-read technologies are recent and still under development. They were, until recently, relatively expensive compared to short reads, but the arrival of ONT Nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) has shown that it is possible to use long-reads for reasonable costs while requiring minimal sample preparation before sequencing. This democratization makes routine clinical applications such as diagnostics or personalized medicine possible. \n\nONT continues its developments, closely followed by competitors such as PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA), which now offer more affordable devices. Recently, ONT has opened the way to peptide sequencing methods using the same principle [134,135]. ONT's developments are also focused on reducing or even eliminating the use of chemical reagents to prepare the libraries. Thus, the expertise required before sequencing is reduced to a minimum.",

            "text": "The comparatively higher error rate (15% on the average) and the increased cost with respect to short read technologies are considerable disadvantages that limit the application of longread sequencing in current large-scale genome resequencing studies. However, the continuous improvements in sequencing chemistries and base calling algorithms, and the development of novel sequencing platforms with reduced operating costs such as the PacBio Sequel or the Oxford Nanopore Promethion might open the possibility of applying long-read sequencing technologies to population scale resequencing projects in the near future. In this respect, the recent development of sequencing strategies for the generation of synthetic long reads relying on existing Illumina platforms, with error profiles and throughput similar to those of current Illumina devices, might represent a valid alternative to long-read sequencing technologies. Two different systems for generating synthetic long-reads are currently available: the Illumina synthetic longread sequencing platform (McCoy et al., 2014) (formerly known as Moleculo) and the 10X Genomics emulsion-based system4 . Both platforms rely on a similar strategy, where a specialized library preparation method based on extreme dilution and DNA barcoding is applied to a size selected DNA library in order to mimic single molecule sequencing. Input DNA is first sheared into kilobase-long fragments, which are then randomly distributed across a small number of containers. The contents of each container are then sheared further into shorter fragments and are assigned a unique barcode before being pooled together for sequencing. After sequencing, reads are demultiplexed using the barcodes. Each container may be assembled separately with a short-read assembler, which produces multiple kilobaselong sequences in each well; this approach is referred to as subassembly. Alternatively, the contents of each container may be sequenced at a relatively low coverage and resulting reads might be used to assist in tasks such as genome phasing and scaffolding. The main difference between the two approaches consists in that while the Illumina system is aimed at the precise reconstruction of each long DNA fragment and is designed for genome assembly, the 10X strategy does not attempt gapless, end-to-end coverage of single DNA fragments, and is generally used for haplotyping and scaffolding.",

            "text": "The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65]. The promise of the application of third-generation sequencing is emerging in recent literature, demonstrating that PacBio circumvents the issue of VH and VL matching [66][67][68]. Furthermore, besides preserving the linking information of VH and VL, the obtaining of full-length scFvs' sequences could, in the future, also circumvent the need to physically retrieve phages' clones from the sub-library by synthesizing the VH and VL of interest, thanks to the progressively lowering of synthetic DNA cost services (<0.1 US dollar/base) [134]. This perspective, alongside advances in high-throughput reformatting of phage displayed antibody fragments to IgGs [99,135,136], as well as to the implementation of engineered mammalian cell factories for improved production [122,137], will soon make it possible to efficiently test antibodies from display libraries in the end-use format, facilitating their preclinical development. Recently, also machine learning and neural networks have been implemented to optimize the screening itself and antibodies' properties [138,139]. Furthermore, the future challenge to widespread mAbs' use will likely be related to manufacturing costs, as this latter is still a major hurdle associated with mAbs. The high cost per patient is especially attributable to both high doses and the continuous administrations, especially needed in the two fastest-growing therapeutic areas of chronic diseases and cancer immunotherapy [130,140]. One of the remarkable innovative approaches is the in vivo gene transfer of mAbs. This technology-also currently investigated in clinical trials-is particularly attractive for the management of chronic diseases [141]. Indeed, as an alternative to the administration of mAb proteins, gene transfer resolves to administer the genetic information for mAb, allowing the patient to produce therapeutic mAbs for a sustained period, and thus avoiding the repetitive passive administration of recombinant proteins.",

Two long-read sequencing technologies, from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), are commercially available. Oxford Nanopore sequencers measure changes in ionic current when the DNA fragments translocate through protein nanopores in a semi-synthetic insulated membrane. Because the detection process does not require enzyme-based nucleotide incorporation and detection of fluorescent signals, ONT sequencing read length is theoretically only limited by the length of the DNA fragment translocating through the pore. Consequently, sequences >2 Mbps in length have been reported. This read length advantage is partially offset by the fact that individual raw sequencing reads tend to have higher error rates than secondgeneration sequencing reads, thus requiring sequence correction and post-assembly sequence polishing to generate high-quality sequencing data. Shortly after its inception, studies have shown that the ONT technology could be used for assembling microbial genomes [3][4][5] . Continuous improvements in chemistry, base calling, and sequencing throughputs have recently allowed researchers to use the technology for producing high-quality whole genome assemblies for larger genomes, in combination with Illumina sequencing reads, in species such as human 6 , Arabidopsis thaliana 7 , and the wild tomato species Solanum pennellii 8 .\n\nNumerous genomic assembly projects, including maize 9 and Aegilops tauschii 10 , have generated chromosome-scale scaffolds when combining long-read PacBio sequences with complementary long-range scaffolding technologies, such as Bionano Genomics optical maps or Hi-C proximity ligation 11 . The optical mapping technology developed by Bionano Genomics has been used in genome sequencing projects to provide contig sequence validation, error correction, and high-level scaffolding resulting in significant increases in contiguity and quality 12,13 . Recently, Bionano Genomics introduced a new labeling concept, called Direct Label and Stain (DLS). In DLS, the Direct Labeling Enzyme 1 (DLE-1",

            "text": ", including bacterial sequences (Muerdter et al. 2018), which may accumulate undetected errors as a result of spot-check sequencing approaches and can impact downstream function.\n\nHigh-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) does allow for simultaneous sequencing of large numbers of plasmids and provides full plasmid sequences (Gallegos et al. 2020). However, NGS is cost-prohibitive outside of large-scale approaches, and sample pooling coordination, indexing compatibility issues, equipment cost, and turnaround time are major barriers to its widespread adoption and make it unsuited for routine plasmid validation. Additionally, NGS does not allow for detection of variation outside of unique regions of plasmids in libraries due to the inability to uniquely map short reads to an individual plasmid (Liu et al. 2012).\n\nHere we present OnRamp (Oxford Nanopore-based Rapid Analysis of Multiplexed Plasmids), a tool that leverages Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long-read benchtop sequencing platform to obtain full sequences of pooled plasmids. OnRamp addresses the need for an approach that is simpler and more cost-effective than NGS, while providing full plasmid sequences at medium-throughput scale in a rapid, amplification-and barcode-free manner at $1.25 per kb, less than half the cost of equivalent Sanger sequencing. We describe here custom plasmid preparation protocols for use with OnRamp, testing of the OnRamp pipeline using simulated read data, and demonstrate detection of variation using real plasmid data across plasmid pools containing both dissimilar and highly similar (clonal) plasmid sequences. OnRamp comprises both these custom protocols and an analysis pipeline for ONT long-read pooled plasmid data, which is available through a web application (https://onramp.boylelab.org/), making interpretation of sequencing results accessible and simple.",

Selecting an appropriate sequencing platform is undoubtedly crucial for the success of the research outcome, thus there is a need to compare these long-read sequencing platforms and evaluate them for specific research questions. This study aims to compare the performance of PacBio and ONT platforms for transcriptomic analysis by utilizing transcriptome data from three different tissues (hepatopancreas, intestine, and gonads) of the juvenile black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. We compared three important features: (i) main characteristics of the sequencing libraries and their alignment with the reference genome, (ii) transcript assembly features and isoform identification, and (iii) correlation of the quantification of gene expression levels for both platforms. Our analyses suggest that read-length bias and differences in sequencing throughput are highly influential factors when using long reads in transcriptome studies. These comparisons can provide a guideline when designing a transcriptome study utilizing these two long-read sequencing technologies.",

            "text": "Abstract Background Long-read sequencing can be applied to generate very long contigs and even completely assembled genomes at relatively low cost and with minimal sample preparation. As a result, long-read sequencing platforms are becoming more popular. In this respect, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies\u2013based long-read sequencing \u201cnanopore\" platform is becoming a widely used tool with a broad range of applications and end-users. However, the need to explore and manipulate the complex data generated by long-read sequencing platforms necessitates accompanying specialized bioinformatics platforms and tools to process the long-read data correctly. Importantly, such tools should additionally help democratize bioinformatics analysis by enabling easy access and ease-of-use solutions for researchers. Results The Galaxy platform provides a user-friendly interface to computational command line\u2013based tools, handles the software dependencies, and provides refined workflows. The users do not have to possess programming experience or extended computer skills. The interface enables researchers to perform powerful bioinformatics analysis, including the assembly and analysis of short- or long-read sequence data. The newly developed \u201cNanoGalaxy\" is a Galaxy-based toolkit for analysing long-read sequencing data, which is suitable for diverse applications, including de novo genome assembly from genomic, metagenomic, and plasmid sequence reads. Conclusions A range of best-practice tools and workflows for long-read sequence genome assembly has been integrated into a NanoGalaxy platform to facilitate easy access and use of bioinformatics tools for researchers.

The numbers of reads output by Illumina sequencers could accurately quantify the highly expressed genes. However, because Illumina sequencers are appropriate only for short read-length sequencing, we must fragment RNA or cDNA during sample preparation. Thus, the read length is the major limitation in short-read RNA-Seq which would cause the loss of some information from the original full-length transcripts, and therefore it is hard to analyse several aspects of co/posttranscriptional processing events.\n\nWith the rapid development of sequencing technology, long-read sequencing platforms, including Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [1] and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [2], which have the capability to sequence entire",

The single-molecule real-time sequencing-by-synthesis (SMRT) technology from Pacific Biosciences introduced read lengths of single DNA fragments exceeding 10 Kb, and long sequences are particularly useful for de novo genome assemblies, especially where genomes are large or contain repetitive DNA, as is the case with many plants [10]. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) has commercialized two sequencing systems, RSII model and Sequel II, producing high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with more than 99% accuracy [11], and Revio is an advanced platform to generate HiFi reads at a higher throughput (15X. SMRT now enables the generation of very long reads of lengths over 30 Kb to 50 Kb. \n\nWith continual upgrades in sequencing chemistry and technology, it is possible to generate longer reads of over 100 Kb in length. Nanopore is a technology that takes a different approach to sequencing via synthesis adopted by PacBio. This technology (proposed in 1990 and commercialized by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT) decodes the DNA molecule by detecting electrical fluctuations as a nucleic acid molecule passes through a small diameter biological \"pore\". Continuous sequences from single molecules up to 500 Kb have been reported, although generally, a single molecule sequence is likely to average around 20 Kb [12]. By having multiple parallel pores and very rapid processing, it is possible to obtain hundreds of gigabases of nucleotide sequences at a low cost. Early iterations of the technology had relatively poor accuracy, and while the accuracy has improved (partly through the development of software specifically for interpreting nanopore signals), a nanopore is often corrected in practice by using highly accurate short Illumina reads before being used for genome assembly. Nanopore technology comes in different versions, including MinION, benchtop GridION, VolTRAX, and high-throughput PromethION [13]. Next, 10\u00d7 Genomics is another long-read sequence technology (www.10xgenomics.com) integrated with GemCode technology supplied with the Supernova2 genome assembler.",

Long-read sequencing technologies developed by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) overcome many of the limitations researchers face with short reads [20]. However, while standard long-read sequencing protocols often employed in PacBio sequencing include a size selection step that may exclude smaller plasmids [19], nanopore sequencing using ONT platforms has been employed to decipher the structures of smaller plasmids [21,22]. A unique property of the ONT MinION platform is its size, cost, portability, and the real-time utility, where very long reads are rapidly generated [23]. \n\nHere, the complete genome sequence of L. plantarum MF1298 is reported, which consists of one circular chromosome and an unusually high number of plasmids: 14 circular plasmids ranging in size from 2.3 to 63.1 kb were identified. The accurate complete sequence of MF1298 was obtained in a stepwise approach, in which long-read PacBio sequencing was initially used to obtain the sequence of the chromosome and the two largest plasmids. Subsequent short-read Illumina sequencing of the total genomic DNA fraction showed that a substantial amount of plasmid content was lacking from the PacBio assembly. To resolve the plasmid complement, known to often contain genes associated with important functions in LAB strains [18], the plasmid DNA fraction was sequenced using both Illumina and long-read ONT MinION sequencing, and a hybrid assembly was generated using the combined data.",

Enrichment of specific genomic fragments by PCR-generated baits for sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer was demonstrated by Karamitros & Magiorkinis (2015).\n\nHere, we present an adaptation of the method used by Brown et al. (2015) and Christiansen et al. (2014), enrichment of DNA fragments of between 1 and 15 kb for sequencing on long-read platforms. We joined the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION Access Program to assess the suitability of this platform used in combination with the targeted enrichment method. We compared sequence data from unenriched and enriched cultured influenza virus A and HCMV samples, run on the MinION and Illumina MiSeq platforms. We also mixed cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) genomic DNA from two different strains with human DNA to evaluate the efficiency of enrichment by hybridisation for longer bacterial DNA fragments. We found that the long genomic fragments were readily purified from a background of the cell line used for producing the viruses, or, in case of M. tb, mixed with human DNA. DNA from HCMV strain Merlin grown in fibroblast cell culture (6.75\u00c210 6 copies ml \u00c01 , determined by qPCR) was a kind gift of R.

            "text": "Phage display libraries based on M13 filamentous bacteriophage can present a vast diversity of antibody fragments on the pIII minor coat protein, utilising either a phagemid or phage vector system to encode the antibody-coat protein fusion (the different display systems including mutated helper phage are reviewed elsewhere, [1][2][3]). The presence of the antibody on the surface of the phage particle is accompanied by the gene for the antibody being packaged within the phage. In this way the phenotype (antibody binding) and the genotype (antibody gene) are linked [2]. Within standard panning methods, the highly diverse antibody library is introduced to an immobilised antigen and unbound phage washed away, bound phage are then eluted, usually by a shift in pH and the resulting sub-library propagated in Escherichia coli to amplify each phage clone. Such panning cycles are usually carried out 3-5 times to enrich for phage-antibodies that bind to the target antigen and hundreds of single phage clones are then isolated, propagated and tested in ELI-SAs [2]. More recently, screening has used next generation sequencing platforms to sequence thousands to millions of antibody genes contained within the selected sub-libraries of phage after panning. Sequencing usually targets the whole VH or the CDRH3 domain. These methods allow a thorough investigation of the enrichment of phage clones, even when they are minor components of the sub-libraries [4][5][6]. Phage display libraries can enable the identification of a variety of antibodies with desirable binding properties including antibodies that bind to toxic or non-immunogenic antigens. \n\nNaturally occurring or designed antibody domains have been developed that are suited for phage display but still retain the binding properties of a full-length IgG (Fig. 1). These domains include antigen binding fragments (Fab), single chain Fv (scFv) and single domain antibodies (nanobodies). The latter include camelid V H H and shark V NAR (New Antigen Receptor). \n\nPhage antibody libraries are classed as na\u00efve, semisynthetic, synthetic or immune libraries [2].",

            "text": "In the last decade we have witnessed an unprecedented development in sequencing technologies. This is sometimes referred to as the next-generation sequencing (NGS) revolution.\n\nYear by year, new technologies and chemistries have, to varying degrees, enabled increased throughput, read lengths and sequence quality. Currently there is a wide range of technologies and companies that allow sequencing and genomics analysis at a speed and with a throughput thought impossible only few years ago. In this work we focus our attention on three established technologies and their compatible tools: Illumina [1], PacBio [2] and OpGen [3]. However, the methods presented here can easily be extended and applied to similar and/or emerging technologies, e.g., IonTorrent [4], Oxford Nanopore [5] and BioNano [6]. The Illumina sequencing technology has become a leading tool in a wide range of application areas. Among others, Illumina is used for whole genome resequencing, haplotype phasing and identification of structural variations. Illumina technology is also widely used in de novo genome assembly projects. Despite the short read length, Illumina is used to quickly and cheaply obtain high genome coverages [7].\n\nIn 2011 Pacific Biosciences released the first commercially available long-read sequencer based on singlemolecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. In contrast to the short (i.e., 150 to 300 bp) Illumina reads, the PacBio RS II instrument produces average read lengths ranging from 10-15 kb, with the ultralong reads exceeding 50 kb. Such unprecedented read lengths are ideal for de novo assembly. However, long reads are also a key in studying structural variations or investigating isoforms by sequencing full-length intact transcripts [8][9][10][11].\n\nAnother technology is optical mapping [12][13][14][15][16], a method based on mapping the position of enzyme restriction sites along the sequence of the genome as observed by fluorescence microscopy, which was automated [17,18] to achieve high-throughput solutions amenable to the analysis of complex genomes. This technique allows the production of extremely long (hundreds of kbp) restriction maps, which to date has",

Each of the platforms has its own advantages and disadvantages related to accuracy, efficiency, and the cost. The whole process, from nucleic acid extraction through final sequence reporting, typically takes a minimum of 5-10 days (Petersen et al., 2020). Furthermore, highly advanced bioinformatics knowledge is required for data processing and analysis (Shendure & Ji, 2008). \n\nAfter the development of the first-(the Sanger's chain termination method) and the second (pyrosequencing)-generation sequencing approaches, which have been successfully used for several years and still are wildly used, a novel sequencing method based on nanopore technology, called the third-generation sequencing, was introduced (Bleidorn, 2016;Gavrielatos et al., 2021;Kuleshov et al., 2014;Petersen et al., 2020;Rhoads & Au, 2015;Schadt et al., 2010).",

            "text": "In recent years, long-read sequencing technologies have gained popularity for their ability to directly sequence DNA molecules spanning several kilobases. These technologies, pioneered by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), are commonly referred to as thirdgeneration sequencing technology. So far, both ONT (6%-8% error rate) and PacBio (up to 13% error rate, with up to 99.999% base call accuracy achievable through multiple-pass sequencing) exhibit relatively high error rates 19,20 . However, the advantage of long-read sequencing lies in its extended read length, leading to increased overall alignment quality compared to short reads 21 . Long-read sequencing can provide high alignment quality even at low sequencing depths, while short-read sequencing typically requires high sequencing depth for optimal alignment. PacBio long-read sequencing remains costprohibitive for widespread adoption in settings with limited resources. In contrast, ONT sequencing instruments and chemistry are highly affordable, user-friendly, and efficient, making complex sequencing experiments accessible even on a small scale 22 . ONT long-read sequencing offers high coverage of the full-length 16S rRNA gene, reducing the likelihood of misaligned highly conserved regions, despite its relatively high error rate. Many researchers have consequently started to employ long-read ONT 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for microbial compositional analysis 12,[23][24][25][26] . \n\nONT offers a combined PCR amplification-barcoding kit (16S Barcoding Kit 1-24, product number SQK-16S024) designed for efficient multiplexed full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A streamlined protocol combines the amplification and barcoding of the full-length 16S rRNA gene in a single PCR step. ONT proprietary amplification primers feature the universal 27F and 1492R priming sequences along with barcode sequence tags.",

These methods are characterized by two main features: 1) no PCR prior to sequencing (limiting artifacts) and 2) sequences are recorded in real-time (i.e., during the polymerase reaction or depolymerization). These methods can each yield very long reads (.5 Kb and up to 13-14 Kb for PacBio) making them useful in de novo genome sequencing efforts. Short reads from the PacBio SMRT technology can be highly accurate since the platform has the ability to resequence the circularized molecule repeatedly until base confidences are high; however, long reads have a very high endemic error rate (ca. 15%). Approaches are being developed to correct the SMRT data using large quantities of accurate but short-read Illumina data (English et al. 2012;Koren et al. 2012). The Nanopore technology is currently not widely available, so much is still unknown concerning its performance. Moreover, although SMRT methods provide much longer reads than earlier NGS approaches with considerable simplification of library preparation, neither is currently well supported by common NGS bioinformatics tools.",

            "text": "Directed evolution is a pivotal strategy for new antibody discovery, which allowed the generation of high-affinity Fabs against gliadin from two antibody libraries in our previous studies. One of the libraries was exclusively derived from celiac patients\u2019 mRNA (immune library) while the other was obtained through a protein engineering approach (semi-immune library). Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques are revolutionizing research across genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. In the present work, an Oxford Nanopore in-lab sequencing device was used to comprehensively characterize the composition of the constructed libraries, both at the beginning and throughout the phage-mediated selection processes against gliadin. A customized analysis pipeline was used to select high-quality reads, annotate chain distribution, perform sequence analysis, and conduct statistical comparisons between the different selection rounds. Some immunological attributes of the most representative phage variants after the selection process were also determined. Sequencing results revealed the successful transfer of the celiac immune response features to the immune library and the antibodies derived from it, suggesting the crucial role of these features in guiding the selection of high-affinity recombinant Fabs against gliadin. In summary, high-throughput DNA sequencing has improved our understanding of the selection processes aimed at generating molecular binders against gliadin.",

            "text": "Currently, there is no assay to study TRs simultaneously, let alone on a human genome scale [14]. \n\nNext-generation sequencing reads from the most conventional platforms (e.g., Illumina) are too short to directly resolve TRs. In the last 2 years, new algorithms were developed to circumvent this limitation, which enables screening for potential STR expansions. However, these length estimations lack accuracy and validation with gold standard techniques like Southern blotting is still necessary [14]. \n\nA solution can theoretically be obtained with longread sequencing. These technologies have rapidly improved in the last years with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) now providing the opportunity to perform human whole genome long-read sequencing. Long sequencing reads can span entire (expanded) TR alleles, providing TR length, nucleotide composition, and the possibility to detect nucleotide modifications. In practice, however, the higher sequencing error rates of long-read sequencing may limit this application and necessitates evaluation [15]. ONT sequencing has several characteristics which makes it particularly attractive to study TRs. It is based on direct sensing of nucleotides and does not require DNA polymerization. As such, ONT sequencing suffers less from a GC coverage bias in the often GCrich TRs [16], and nucleotide modifications can be directly detected. Secondly, there is no technical maximum on read length and the sequencing quality does not decay with increasing length [17]. Thirdly, real-time data processing on ONT devices can lower the turnaround time [18]. Lastly, with the release of the high-throughput PromethION sequencing platform in 2018, ONT now provides the most cost-effective human whole genome long-read sequencing option. \n\nA few reports exist on the use of long-read sequencing in TRs. However, these are limited to small-scale tests on plasmids, specifically amplified genomic regions, and/or do not include expanded TR alleles [8,19,20].",

            "text": "Long-read sequencing, also referred to as third-generation sequencing, has several substantial advantages over short-read next generation sequencing [27,28]. First, it can produce reads exceeding 10 kb [28] in transcriptomics context and even 10 mb in whole genome studies, while short-read technologies provide only 150-300 bases reads (Illumina) [27,29], up to 600 bases like in BGI technology [30] or in Thermo Fisher's Ion Torrent technology [31,32]. Although short-read sequencing is cost-effective and accurate [33], natural nucleic acid polymers like DNA and RNA span eight orders of magnitude in length, and sequencing them in short 150-600 bp amplified fragments makes the quantitative reconstruction of the original molecules a significantly challenging task, especially in the cases when de novo fusion mutations are generated in cancer context, and not only. Long-read sequencing provides means for very accurate de novo reads assembly and mapping, complex transcript isoform identification, as well as the detection of structural variants. \n\nWe will further focus on the Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing, as it has some advantages for transcriptomics that currently no other technology possesses [34]. Although currently the PacBio long-read platform provides sequencing with higher accuracy in regard to single-cell sequencing and cell barcoding, the ability of ONT direct sequencing to detect epitranscriptomic and epigenomic changes would have a higher impact in the field of biology and translational medicine in the long term. This advantage is based on the core foundation of the technology, namely the ability of ONT sequencers (MinION, GridION and PromethION) to measure the fluctuations in the ionic current produced by a single-stranded nucleic acid passing through a biological nanopore. Through a process named basecalling, the nucleotide sequence can be inferred using the specific patterns of current variation across the pore, since different nucleotides confer different resistances to the stretch of nucleic acid within the pore [35,36].",

            "text": "Second generation sequencing platforms have revolutionised bacterial genomic research by giving many laboratories access to high-throughput and high quality sequencing. These platforms are capable of sequencing, in parallel, massive numbers of PCR-amplified DNA molecules. Most of them perform sequencing by synthesis, i.e. by imaging DNA polymerase-mediated nucleotide incorporation into growing DNA strands. They generate vast amounts of high quality sequence data but often suffer from amplification and sequencing bias complications, and their read lengths are generally restricted to a few hundred bases 1,2 .\n\nThese short read lengths make it difficult to obtain complete de novo assemblies for genomes that include longer repetitive sequences, so resolving the genomic order of some contiguous sequences (contigs) can be challenging. In our experience of sequencing and assembling Francisella genomes, sequencing with Illumina technology typically generates 20-100 contigs due to the presence of variable numbers of IS elements 3 .\n\nHowever, a third generation of sequencers capable of producing reads several to tens of kilobases long is emerging. A prime example is the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II system, which has set the standard for commercial long-read sequencing by offering up to 30 kb reads. Like most other sequencing platforms it is based on sequencing by synthesis. However, it offers some major advantages over earlier technologies in that it can monitor individual DNA molecules, record the incorporation of fluorescently labelled nucleotides in real-time 4 , and eliminate much of the inherent sequencing bias of second generation platforms 1 . To improve sequence quality, in the PacBio system adapters are ligated at both ends of each DNA molecule to form a continuous DNA circle. This allows each DNA molecule to be sequenced through multiple passes to build a more accurate consensus read 5 . The technology has not yet matched second generation platforms in terms of sequence quality but has proven useful in various applications including contig scaffolding 6  Another promising platform is the MinION TM device, which was released in early 2014 by Oxford Nanopore Technologies through an early access program (The MinION Access Program, MAP). Like the PacBio system, it delivers long read real-time sequencing of individual molecules. It also has two very distinctive features: it is the first commercial nanopore-based (rather than synthesis-based) sequencer, and",

            "text": "Modern long read technologies produce reads of approximately 10-100 kb length from preferably unfragmented DNA (Figure 2C). The Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) technology relies on the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand by a single polymerase enzyme emitting light when incorporating a nucleotide to the growing DNA strand [11]. The sequencing instruments from Oxford Nanopore Technolo- gies pass a single-stranded DNA molecule through a protein pore and measure an ionic current corresponding to the nucleotides residing in the pore at each moment [12]. Though these processes are massively parallelized, they do not yet reach the throughput and low cost of short read sequencing (Table 1). Despite enormous improvements in accuracy, long read data still suffer from much higher error rates than short read data. To circumvent the lower accuracy, Pacific Biosciences has launched a high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing protocol, which sequences the same DNA fragments several times to allow computing a consensus sequence, thereby averaging out many sequencing errors. A limitation of PacBio sequencing is the high amount of DNA required as input. \n\nThough long reads are less suited to detect SNVs and indels because of their low per base accuracy, the increasing availability and dropping error rate of long read data has led to the development of the first dedicated long read SNV detection tools, e. g., Longshot. In contrast, the long read length simplifies the identification of SVs, e. g., using SVIM [13], as a single long read often spans an entire SV. Most notably in repetitive sequences, long read methods outperform short read methods when searching for SVs. Because long reads frequently span multiple variants, detected variants can be phased into the parental haplotypes, e. g., using WhatsHap [14]. Despite these advantages, the high cost and high error rate are still barriers to a widespread use of long read sequencing.",

LRS promises significant improvement over short read sequencing in four major areas: (1) better detection of structural variation (2) better resolution of highly repetitive or nonunique regions (3) accurate long\u2010range haplotype phasing and (4) the detection of base modifications natively from the sequencing data. Several successful applications of LRS have demonstrated its ability to resolve molecular diagnoses where short\u2010read sequencing fails to identify a cause. However, the argument for increased diagnostic yield from LRS remains to be validated. Larger cohort studies may be required to establish the realistic boundaries of LRS's clinical utility and analytical validity, as well as the development of standards for clinical applications. We discuss the limitations of the current standard of care, and contrast with the applications and advantages of two major LRS platforms, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, for molecular diagnostics of constitutional disorders, and present a critical argument about the potential of LRS in diagnostic settings.",

The importance of this platform was recognized by the award of the 2018 Noble Prize to scientists that developed the technology. 21 One of the main limitations of the standard screening method is that, during the biopanning process, some binding clones become dominant (as was observed for the OX40 selection), resulting in identification of alimited number of different candidates after screening. For example, in our study only 40 of 384 clones would not have been derived from the dominant clone in the OX40 selection. The advent of NGS has dramatically increased the depth and breadth of the analysis of display library selection outputs, making it possible to obtain information not only on the clones identified using aconventional colony screening method, but also additional, less abundant, candidates.- 14,15,20,22 Among the most commonly used NGS platforms, there has been asteady increase in the number and length of reads that can be obtained, but only PacBio has invested in increasing read length to alevel commensurate with obtaining full-length sequences of displayed antibody-like molecules, i. e., scFvs and Fabs. For this reason, isolating clones identified by NGS from aselection campaign, to test their functional properties, continues to be achallenge. With PacBio now able to provide full-length clone sequences, gene synthesis is avaluable option, but remains prohibitive on alarge scale, even if the cost of gene synthesis is becoming significantly cheaper. Furthermore, gene synthesis usually takes weeks. We previously described an approach allowing the direct isolation of NGS identified clones of interest from aselected library using an inverse PCR 23 and ligation-based strategy that exploits the unique barcode nature of the HCDR3 sequence  to synthesize pairs of outward-facing primers that used to amplify plasmids containing the HCDR3. 15 However, that approach was not very effective for short HCDR3s or clones with abundances less than 1%. \n\nHere, we explored afaster, cheaper method, requiring the design of asingle specific primer for each HCDR3 of interest, to quickly translate an NGS analysis into actual clones.",

A total of 14 FLO-MIN106R9 cells were run using standard kits and reagents and following manufacturer's protocols. Cells routinely produced 3-5 gigabases (Gb) data, but a small portion of cells stopped prematurely [after 100 megabases (Mb) of data]. These failed cells were replaced by Oxford Nanopore Technology at no cost.

            "text": "DNA sequencing techniques are currently under constant development. Meanwhile techniques for single molecule sequencing, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Nanopore), and Pacific Bioscience (PacBio), termed third generation sequencing, are increasingly available. To our knowledge, these techniques have so far not yet been applied for spider venom gland studies. With read lengths between 10,000 and 100,000 bases, third generation sequencing techniques produce much longer reads than next generation sequencing [248]. These read lengths enable full-length mRNA sequencing overcoming problems in de-novo assembly often encountered in next generation sequencing protocols. Full-length mRNA sequencing also provides a significant advantage for quantification of transcripts of closely related isoforms [249]. This can be challenging with short read methods as a read may not be unambiguously assigned to a single isoform. \n\nThird generation sequencing methods, however, have two major drawbacks. (1) High error rates of up to 15% (compared to approx. 0.1% for Illumina), and (2) low throughput compared to Illumina sequencing [249]. These drawbacks can be diminished if data from third generation sequencing is jointly assembled with data from a next generation sequencing technique [250,251]. This hybrid assembly approach, has been shown to facilitate de-novo genome assembly, and may also be applicable to study genomic data of spiders, which has up to now been a challenging task due to many repetitive elements, difficult to assemble from short reads. Third generation sequencing techniques may also drastically facilitate analysis of highly repetitive transcripts, such as the ones coding for complex cytolytic precursors (see above). The attractiveness of using PacBio alone for de-novo genome or transcriptome sequencing was very recently enhanced with the publication of a circular consensus sequencing protocol allowing reduction of error rates to <1% for single-molecule reads of up to 15 kb length [252,253]. \n\nIn spider venomic studies, third generation techniques have not established yet and many recently published data were still acquired with next generation techniques or conventional Sanger sequencing. While 454 sequencing was meanwhile discontinued by Roche, Illumina sequencing stays widely used and gets further developed with the only recently released NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system.",

            "text": "Currently there are two platforms which offer single molecule sequencing with long reads. Single Molecule Real Time sequencing (SMRT) from PacBio is a parallelized single molecule DNA sequencing method. A recent study led by Evan Eichler [8] sequenced a haploid human genome (CHM1) using PacBio long reads to identify missing sequence and genetic variation. The sequenced read-depth is 40X and the reads have an average mapped read length of 5.8 kb. Reads were first aligned to the reference assembly and gap regions were extended using a reiterative map-and-assemble strategy. At each stage, a new consensus sequenced was obtained from SMRT whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads mapped to each edge of a gap. In turn, the new consensus served as a template for recruiting additional sequence reads for assembly. In the study, they reported the identification of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the base-pair level, including inversions, complex insertions and long tracts of tandem repeats. Another study using assembly for SV detection was reported by Pendleton, et al. [41], who used 46X PacBio long reads and 80X long molecule Bionano mapping data. Another emerging single molecule sequencing platform is Oxford Nanopore's MinION, a real time nanopore-based DNA sequencing instrument [42][43][44]. With reported features of compact, inexpensive, long read length and fast sequencing data production, the MinION device offers great potential for genome analysis from structural variation perspectives. Figure 2a shows read length profiles from two datasets, E. coli [45] and yeast [46]. In the future, it would be interesting to know how to use long reads to accurately annotate complex SVs, such as the one shown in Figure 2b, where popular SV calling tools failed using short Illumina reads. From the study reported in [41], there seems to be a satisfactory solution using local assemblies obtained from long reads with high coverage. For cost reasons, however, challenges ahead for bioinformatics scientists are to seek practical solutions with low read coverage, say 5-10 at which assembly is not able to be done.",

            "text": "Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have made large-scale genomic data more accessible, promoting a new, data-driven approach to the study of biology. The analysis of data after sequencing is a challenging task. One of the biggest challenges for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing reads (i.e. short DNA fragments) is whole genome assembly [33], which is the process of aligning and merging DNA fragments in order to reconstruct the original sequence. More specifically, de novo genome assembly reconstructs the genome from the sequenced DNA without guidance from a reference genome. \n\nDe novo assembly guarantees that the full range of genetic variation of a specific organism will be assessed; thus enabling the identification of individual-specific genetic features in a way that is not biased by any reference [31]. Furthermore, de novo assembly can generate new sequence assemblies for previously uncharacterized genomes [31]. \n\nCurrent high-throughput sequencing methods can be divided in two main categories based on the length of the read: \"short-read\" and \"long-read\" technologies. The main limitation of short-read technologies [3] is their inability to deal with consistent accuracy with genomic repeats longer than the read length, resulting in fragmented assemblies with ambiguous placements of sequences [30,28]. Conversely, long-read technologies, offered by companies Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) with their Single-Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing [12] and Oxford Nanopore Technologies with their Nanopore sequencing [15], generate long reads with average lengths reaching and often exceeding 10,000 base pairs (bp). These allow the resolution of complex genomic repetitions, enabling more accurate ensemble views and leading to new disease models with improved predictive power. However, the improved read length of these technologies comes at the cost of lower accuracy, with error rates ranging from 5% to 35%. Nevertheless, errors are more random and more evenly distributed within PacBio long reads [14] compared to short-read technologies. \n\nWhile the assembly of short reads typically relies on the De Brujin Graph (DBG) abstraction, an overwhelming majority of the state-of-the-art long read assemblers uses the Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) paradigm [4].",

            "text": "In LongGF, we require an alignment is long enough to be significant and that an alignment has substantial overlap with a gene for further analysis. If only a smaller fraction (< 100 bp) of a gene is involved in a gene fusion, it is hard to distinguish the fusion candidates from sequencing/alignment noises. In LongGF, although users can set smaller thresholds to get gene fusions with smaller segments, they will generate more candidate fusion events and need to filter noisy candidates in the results. \n\nWith full-length transcriptome sequencing, we expect that long-read RNA-seq data (Oxford Nanopore and PacBio) will greatly facilitate gene fusion detection by overcoming many technical limitations of short reads. Compared to PacBio (either with traditional library or HiFi library preparation protocols), at fixed cost, Oxford Nanopore may be a more promising platform in gene fusion detection while generating data with higher error rate. This is because Nanopore currently has lower perbase cost of data generation, and our real data analysis showed that sequencing data with high read coverage can improve detection accuracy significantly. For Nanopore RNA-seq, there are two types: direct mRNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing. Compared to direct mRNA sequencing, cDNA sequencing allows samples to be amplified and requires less amount of starting materials, making it attractive in some cases. With more materials for sequencing (possibly in multiple flow cells), this can increase the read coverage at fusion breakpoint, and facilitate LongGF to detect gene fusions with low expression or low allele fraction (such as the BCR-ABL1 fusion discussed earlier). Additionally, we will conduct more comparison of the performance between LongGF with existing short read tools, for samples where both short-read and long-read sequencing data are available and the sample is available for experimental validation. We expect that we may find fusion events that are missed by short-read sequencing approaches, even when the sequencing coverage in short-read data is very high, if part of the fusion event falls under repetitive genomic regions.",

            "text": "The long reads can span most of the bacterial genome repeats and, therefore, allow the reconstruction of complete bacterial chromosomes and plasmids.Complete genomes enhance the resolution of phylogenetic analyses and the analysis of horizontal gene transfer networks, and provide higher quality data for the discovery of novel genotypes associated with clinically relevant phenotypes (e.g., antimicrobial resistance, virulence, persistence) [15,16].Over the past decade, long-read sequencing platforms have become increasingly competitive with short-read sequencing in terms of cost, throughput, and sequencing accuracy.As a result, long-read sequencing has led to many breakthroughs such as: the complete sequencing of the human genome [17], the recovery of complete bacterial genomes from metagenomes [18], and real-time tracking of epidemics and pandemics [19,20].\n\nWhen comparing the PacBio and ONT platforms, PacBio HiFi sequencing can produce highly accurate reads that can reconstruct highly accurate (> 99.999% [21]) and nearly complete bacterial genomes from pure cultures and metagenomes.However, the sequencer is expensive, not portable, and has a relatively high cost per sequenced base [22][23][24].In contrast, some ONT platforms like the MinIon are portable and provide realtime sequencing, are cost-effective, and have a relatively simpler library preparation, but the reconstructed bacterial genomes are less accurate (~ 99.95%) [25].For context, a 5 Mbp bacterial genome with 99.95% accuracy still contains 2,500 nucleotide errors.These errors can obscure the estimation of phylogenetic relationships between outbreak isolates, which may only differ by a few nucleotides [13,[26][27][28].Many of the errors in the nanopore assemblies are inherited from the reads which often have a sequencing error rate between 5 and 15%.Most of the sequencing errors are insertions or deletions (indels) associated with repetitive genomic regions, such as homopolymers, short repeats, or regions with high GC content, and are caused by the variable translocation speed of the DNA through the nanopore [29].",

            "text": "Recent advances in long-read sequencing technology have enabled the sequencing of RNA molecules, using either cDNA-based or direct RNA protocols from Oxford Nanopore (referred to as ONT or Nanopore) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). The Iso-Seq protocol from PacBio consists in a size selection step, sequencing of cDNAs, and finally a set of computational steps that produce sequences of full-length transcripts. ONT has three different experimental protocols for sequencing RNA molecules: cDNA transformation with amplification, direct cDNA (with or without amplification), and direct RNA.\n\nLong-read sequencing is increasingly used in transcriptome studies (Sedlazeck et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2016;Byrne et al., 2017;Oikonomopoulos et al., 2016) as they better describe exon/intron combinations (Sedlazeck et al., 2018). For instance the Iso-seq protocol has been used for isoform identification, including transcripts identification , de novo isoform discovery (Li et al., 2017) and fusion transcript detection (Weirather et al., 2015). Nanopore has recently been used for isoform identification (Byrne et al., 2017) and quantification (Oikonomopoulos et al., 2016).\n\nThe sequencing throughput of long-read technologies is significantly increasing over the years. It is now conceivable to sequence a full eukaryote transcriptome using either only long reads, or a combination of high-coverage long and short (Illumina) reads. Unlike the Iso-Seq protocol that requires extensive in silico processing prior to primary analysis (Sahlin et al., 2018), raw Nanopore reads can in principle be readily analyzed. Direct RNA reads also permit the analysis of base modifications (Workman et al., 2018), unlike all other cDNA-based sequencing technologies. There also exist circular sequencing techniques for Nanopore such as INC-Seq (Li et al., 2016) which aim at reducing error rates, at the expense of a special library preparation. With raw long reads, it is up to the primary analysis software (typically a mapping algorithm) to deal with sequences that have significant per-base error rate, currently around",

            "text": "Beyond shotgun sequencing of a microbiome's DNA content, there exist a number of other sequencing technologies that have become available and may further our understanding of halophilic ecosystems. Studies applying these technologies to more developed microbial fields, such as human gut microbiomes, have shown their great promise and their potential applications in halophilic microbial communities in the near future. \n\nConventional Illumina sequencing is limited to short DNA fragments (50 bp-250 bp), as errors accumulate rapidly at higher read lengths. However, read length, together with sequencing coverage, is undoubtedly a major limiting factor for metagenomics sequence assembly. Longer reads result in more accurate assembly and reduced chimeras, while they improve the contiguity of the assembly by allowing the assembly of repetitive DNA elements [99]. Recent sequencing technologies (minION from Oxford Nanopore and SMRT from PacBio sequencing) produce longer DNA fragments compared to Illumina. PacBio is able to consistently produce long reads (N50 up to 10 Kbp) with a relatively high degree of accuracy [100,101], while Nanopore sequencing produces even longer reads (N50 up to 100 Kbp), but with some sacrifices in accuracy [102,103]. Read lengths from these technologies enable not only the sequencing of complete ribosomal genes for improved taxonomic annotation, but also a significant improvement in the accuracy of metagenomics assembly and binning [101,104]. In highly diverse halophilic communities, long reads can help assemble ambiguous regions resulting from taxonomic heterogeneity, drastically improving the quality of the metagenome assembly [104]. Pseudo-single-cell technology from 10X Genomics, which tags each read with a barcode unique to the cell it came from, also shows great promise in halophilic microbiome deconvolution, as it is able to produce strain-specific synthetic long reads originating from single cells [105]. With reported maximum read lengths of over 1 Mbp from Nanopore, long-read technology is rapidly approaching the point where sequencing complete genomes in a single read is theoretically possible [106]. When this becomes reality, it will propel the field of metagenomics into a new post-assembly era.",

            "text": "Technologies such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (McCarthy 2010) and Oxford Nanopore (Ashton et al. 2014) produce long reads, but at much higher perbase error rate. PacBio has been leveraged for improved bacterial reference genome assemblies (Koren et al. 2013) and for targeted de novo assembly of the complex 1.3 Mb of 17q21.31 (Huddleston et al. 2014). However, these technologies are currently substantially lower in throughput and higher in cost than short-read technologies and so cannot currently be used to cost-effectively uncover variation in repeated regions of the genome. \n\nAn alternative approach used in LFR (Peters et al. 2012), CPTseq (Amini et al. 2014), and Illumina TruSeq Synthetic Long-Reads (previously known as Moleculo) (Kuleshov et al. 2014) utilizes accurate short-read sequencing of long DNA fragments in order to obtain long-range information at high nucleotide accuracy. The Illumina TruSeq protocol is able to produce 10-kbp long reads, retaining the benefits of the highly accurate and cost-effective Illumina technology (Kuleshov et al. 2014) and enabling human genome phasing (Kuleshov et al. 2014) and de novo assembly of complex genomes (Voskoboynik et al. 2013;McCoy et al. 2014). \n\nUnder Illumina's synthetic long-read protocol, DNA sequencing libraries are prepared as follows: First, the genomic DNA is sheared into long (\u226510 kbp) fragments and ligated with amplification adapters at both ends; second, these molecules are diluted into wells so that each well receives only a small fraction (1%-2%) of the genome; third, molecules are amplified, sheared into short fragments, and uniquely barcoded within each well (Kuleshov et al. 2014). The individual wells are then pooled and sequenced together. Demultiplexing the resulting reads by well barcode and aligning them to the reference genome yields clusters of short reads, which we call read clouds, each of which originated from a single long DNA molecule (Fig. 1A).",

            "text": "The major limitation of short-read RNA-seq is the difficulty in accurately reconstructing expressed full-length transcripts from the assembly of reads. This is particularly complicated in complex transcriptomes, where different but highly similar isoforms of the same gene are expressed, and for genes that have many exons and possible alternative promoters or 3' ends. Long-read technologies, such as Pacific-Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT and Oxford Nanopore, that were initially applied to genome sequencing are now being used for transcriptomics and have the potential to overcome this assembly problem. Long-read sequencing provides amplification-free, singlemolecule sequencing of cDNAs that enables recovery of full-length transcripts without the need for an assembly step. PacBio adds adapters to the cDNA molecule and creates a circularized structure that can be sequenced with multiple passes within one single long read. The Nanopore GridION system can directly sequence RNA strands by using RNA processive enzymes and RNA-specific bases. Another interesting technology was previously known as Moleculo (now Illumina's TruSeq synthetic long-read technology), where Illumina library preparation is multiplexed and restricted to a limited number of long DNA molecules that are separately bar-coded and pooled back for sequencing. As one barcode corresponds to a limited number of molecules, assembly is greatly simplified and unambiguous reconstruction to long contigs is possible. This approach has recently been published for RNA-seq analysis [185]. \n\nPacBio RNA-seq is the long-read approach with the most publications to date. The technology has proven useful for unraveling isoform diversity at complex loci [186], and for determining allele-specific expression from single reads [187]. Nevertheless, long-read sequencing has its own set of limitations, such as a still high error rate that limits de novo transcript identifications and forces the technology to leverage the reference genome [188]. Moreover, the relatively low throughput of SMRT cells hampers the quantification of transcript expression. These two limitations can be addressed by matching PacBio experiments with regular, short-read RNA-seq.",

            "text": "In the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (Levy and Myers 2016) revolutionized the field of microbiology (Escobar-Zepeda et al. 2015), which is not only reflected in the exponential increase in the number of fully sequenced microbial genomes but also in the detection of microbial diversity in many hitherto inaccessible habitats based on metagenomics. Using transcriptomics, important advances were also possible in the field of RNA biology (Wang et al. 2009;H\u00f6r et al. 2018) that shaped our understanding of the transcriptional landscape (Croucher and Thomson 2010;Nowrousian 2010) and RNA-mediated regulatory processes in prokaryotes (Saliba et al. 2017). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies can be categorized according to their platform-dependent read lengths and the necessity of a reverse transcription and amplification step to generate cDNA (Stark et al. 2019). Illumina sequencing yields highly accurate yet short sequencing reads (commonly 100-300 bp). Hence, sequence information is only available in a fragmented form, making full-length transcript-or isoform-detection a challenging task (Tilgner et al. 2015;Byrne et al. 2019). Sequencing platforms developed by Pacific Bioscience (Pac-Bio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) solved this issue. Both sequencing methods are bona fide single-molecule sequencing techniques that allow the sequencing of long DNAs or RNAs (Eid et al. 2009;Mikheyev and Tin 2014). However, the base detection differs significantly between the two methods. PacBio sequencers rely on fluorescence-based single-molecule detection that identifies bases based on the unique fluorescent signal of each nucleotide during DNA synthesis by a dedicated polymerase (Eid et al. 2009). In contrast, in an ONT sequencer, the DNA or RNA molecule is pushed through a membranebound biological pore with the aid of a motor protein attached to the pore protein called a nanopore. A change in current is caused by the translocation of the DNA or RNA strand through this nanopore, which serves as a readout signal for the sequencing process.",

            "text": "comprehensive variant discovery can be overcome by long-fragment/read sequencing (27,28). Direct sequencing of long DNA fragments requires single-molecule approaches, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) (29,30). This is because no enzymatic technology exists that can reliably amplify long DNA fragments of arbitrary sequences. The main trade-offs between Illumina and single-molecule long read approaches can at present be characterized as low-cost, high base quality, short fragments (Illumina) versus higher cost, low raw base quality, long fragments (PacBio and ONT) (9,31). As a consequence, whole-genome sequencing technologies now tend to be deployed in highly specialized ways that emphasize different methodologies depending on the goal to be achieved: standard 30\u00d7 Illumina sequencing for small variant detection and relatively low-power SV detection (7,32); mate-pair libraries or single-molecule approaches (i.e. longfragment) for better SV detection and haplotyping (9,33), and hybrid approaches with more than one technology for de novo assembly (15,34).\n\nNovel computational approaches leveraging the special characteristics of 10\u00d7 Genomics data have already generated significant advances in power and accuracy of haplotyping (35,36), cancer genome reconstruction (37,38), metagenome assemblies (39) and de novo assembly of large genomes (14,40,41). 10\u00d7 linked-read sequencing combines low per-base error and good small-variant discovery with long-range information for much improved SV detection (38,42), and the possibility of long-range contiguity in de novo assembly (40,41,43).\n\nAs assembly-based approaches become prevalent for SV detection (44,45), it becomes important to evaluate assembly quality and its dependence on library preparation parameters. We therefore assessed the ability of de novo 10\u00d7 assemblies to support SV detection with different parameters in 10\u00d7 linked-read libraries generation on two wellstudied individual genomes. Our analyses are based on pairwise alignment of the assemblies' contigs to the reference genome and finding gaps, a procedure whose compelling simplicity is only possible with assembly-based approaches (8",

            "text": "Modern sequencers require sufficient material to work with: the Illumina and Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platforms prescribe at least three micrograms, but recommend at least five [1] micrograms. Long-read sequencing technologies such as those offered by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) additionally require high molecular weight (HMW) DNA as a starting material, i.e. material in which individual DNA stretches are long. In many biological settings, obtaining sufficient amounts of DNA of the required quality and length is problematic, such as in studies on single cells [2,3] or single selected chromosomes [4]. To overcome this limitation DNA is amplified, starting from as little as picograms, in a process called whole-genome amplification (WGA) [5]. \n\nA major issue with the WGA process is that it introduces specific chimeric fragments [6,7] consisting of one or more inverted repeats (Fig. 1), so-called palindromes. This effect is partially alleviated by de-branching, however, chimeric fragments still remain [8]. In Illumina paired-end (PE) sequencing these fragments are then sheared into small sub-fragments before library preparation, which reduces the effect on subsequent analyses of the palindromic fragments as they will occur in only few reads. In other approaches to sequencing, however, the full fragments are used. For Illumina mate-pair (MP) sequencing, long palindromic fragments will result in pairs with incorrect directions and unpredictable insert sizes. As a result, short read MP libraries based on WGA are problematic for read mapping and de novo assembly. \n\nTools specifically aiming to detect and correct chimeric reads have been proposed (e.g. uchime [9]) and work well for paired-end and single-end short-read technologies. \n\nFor long reads however, the palindromic nature of the sequence hinders read mapping and renders de novo assembly highly problematic. Due to the high base-calling error rate of the long read technologies (11-38%) [10,11], finding and correcting these palindromic constructs in long reads cannot be done by exact string matching.",

Furthermore, Nanopore sequencing has already been applied for the rapid identification of microorganisms [36] and could be used for the detection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as Salmonella [37]. \n\nHowever, there are still some limitations to long-read technologies. They produce a higher rate of sequencing errors (5-20%) compared to other NGS data (<1%) [38], which are mostly randomly distributed. Nevertheless, long-read technologies are continuously improving, and the error rate is steadily decreasing with new machines. Moreover, bioinformatics algorithms have also evolved and now allow us to generate satisfactory read correction when the sequencing depth is high enough, reaching in some cases an accuracy over 99.9%. Aware of these limitations, the Oxford Nanopore company has refined resolution and throughput sequencing. For this purpose, several Oxford Nanopore products have been developed, including the GridION X5 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) commercialized since March 2017 that can generate up to 100 GB of data per cycle. The PromethION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), a high-throughput desktop device, contains channels for 144,000 nanopores (compared to 512 for the MinIon (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Other platforms are in development, such as the SmidgION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), a sequencer that can be connected to a smartphone and aims to make outdoor sequencing even more accessible.",

However, most genomes contain repeated DNA elements that are longer than the read lengths achievable with typical sequencers, so the genomic order of several generated contigs cannot be easily resolved. A new generation of sequencers offering substantially longer reads is emerging, notably the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II system and the MinION system, released in early 2014 by Oxford Nanopore Technologies through an early access program. The latter has highly advantageous portability and sequences samples by measuring changes in ionic current when single-stranded DNA molecules are translocated through nanopores. We show that the MinION system produces long reads with high mapability that can be used for scaffolding bacterial genomes, despite currently producing substantially higher error rates than PacBio reads. With further development we anticipate that MinION will be useful not only for assembling genomes, but also for rapid detection of organisms, potentially in the field.",

            "text": "In addition, this technology enables de novo assembly and direct detection of haplotypes; high consensus accuracy and allows the epigenetic characterization (direct detection of DNA base modifications at one-base resolution) [7,34]. The first sequencers using the SMRT technology faced the drawbacks of having a limited high-throughput, higher costs and higher error rate. However, significant improvements have been achieved to overcome those limitations. More recently, PacBio launched the Sequel II System, which claims to reduce the project costs and timelines, comparing with the prior versions, with highly accurate individual long reads (HiFi reads, up to 175 kb) [35]. Using a PacBio System, Merker and co-workers claimed to be the first to demonstrate a successful application of long-read genome sequencing to identify a pathogenic variant in a patient with Mendelian disease, suggests that this technology has significant potential for the identification of disease-causing structural variation [36]. \n\nA second approach to single-molecule sequencing was commercialized by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (some authors refer to as fourth-generation) named MinION, commercially available in 2015 [37]. This sequencer does not rely on SBS but instead relies on the electrical changes in current as each nucleotide (A, C, T and G) passes through the nanopore [38]. Nanopore sequencing uses electrophoresis to transport an unknown sample through a small opening, then an ionic current pass through nanopores and the current is changed as the bases pass through the pore in different combinations. This information allows the identification of each molecule and to perform the sequencing [39]. In May 2017, Oxford Nanopore Technologies launched the GridION Mk1, a flexible benchtop sequencing and analysis device that offers real-time, long-read, high-fidelity DNA and RNA sequencing. It was designed to allow that up to five experiments run simultaneously or individually, with simple library preparation, enabling the generation of up to 150 Gb of data during a run [40]. This year, new advances were launched with PromethION 48 system that offers 48 flow cells, and each flow cell allows up to 3000 nanopores sequence in simultaneously, which can deliver up to 7.6 Tb yields in 72 h.",

Twelve single cells were pooled together considering the sequencing cost and the requirement of initial DNA amount for TGS library construction. Nanopore and PacBio are two representative TGS sequencing platforms utilizing different principles. As SMOOTH-seq has only been tested on the PacBio platform, we further compared sequencing results from both technologies, specifically the Nanopore PromethION and the PacBio sequel II with HiFi mode using 12 cells in a library. The reads obtained from both platforms showed over 98% mapping ratios in individual cells, with PacBio data showing slightly better stability (Supporting Information Figure S3A). However, single cells sequenced on the Nanopore platform had a higher number of mapped reads (Supporting Information Figure S3B). The averaged read lengths varied among different cell types, which were likely caused by variable enzymatic activity of Tn5 transposase when applied to different genomes (Supporting Information Figure S3C,D). For U2OS cells, much longer read lengths were obtained with the Nanopore sequencing, which may lead to a relatively lower mapped read ratio (Supporting Information Figure S3A). The scWGS data acquired from the Nanopore platform exhibited enhanced genome coverage due to its higher read output (Supporting Information Figure S3E,F), thereby offering better capability in identifying structural genomic variations. The error rate from the Nanopore platform is much higher than the PacBio platform (Supporting Information Figure S3G), which could potentially affect ecDNA and SVs identification. Besides, there was a positive correlation between read length and error rate, indicating longer reads may contain more sequencing errors (Supporting Information Figure S3C,G). \n\nWe next tried to find ecDNA using the scGTP-seq data. Previous studies have developed analytical tools to resolve ecDNA using WGS reads from NGS platforms. 7,62 owever, few software tools exist for the identification of ecDNA from TGS reads. To address this, we established a bioinformatics pipeline named ecDNAFinder (Figure 2A and Supporting Information Figure S4, Methods).",

Jaffe used the data to resolve ambiguities in Illumina-only assemblies. The reads provided by Oxford Nanopore reached an average of more than 5 kb, with the longest reads over 10 kb, and Jaffe showed a slide made by Oxford Nanopore wherein the read length distribution was precisely overlapping with the fragment length distribution of the library. (This is important because PacBio reads are on average much shorter than the fragments that are read.) The Oxford data had high error rates but more than 80% of the reads had perfect 50-mer sections. Thus, these relatively long, if error-prone, nanopore reads are a first glimpse of what may yet come as these methods and basecalling algorithms improve. Oxford Nanopore has clearly achieved a technical tour de force, with the potential to threaten PacBio's dominance in the ultra-long-read field. \n\nIs there room for more short-read technologies? Hesaam Esfandyarpour from Genapsys (USA) thinks so. He wants to put one or more of his lunchbox-sized devices into every single laboratory. The Genapsys system involves all-electronic detection of incorporation of nucleotides into DNA clonally amplified on magnetic beads. These beads are held above a regular array of electronic detectors. However, the presentation was nearly data-free, leaving the audience craving more specifics regarding the mechanism of signal generation, current throughput, cost, turn-around time, read length, and error rate for this concept.",

This can lead to issues with reproducibility and the occasional loss of antibodies with loss of cell lines. Hybridoma cell lines have been the primary means of generating monoclonal antibodies from immunized animals including mice, rats, rabbits and alpacas. Excluding therapeutic antibodies, few hybridoma-derived antibody sequences are known. Sanger sequencing has been \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for antibody gene sequencing but relies on the availability of species-specific degenerate primer sets for amplification of light and heavy antibody genes, in addition to lengthy and expensive cDNA preparation. Here we leveraged recent improvements in long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to develop NAb-seq: a three-day, species-independent, and cost-effective workflow to characterize paired full-length immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes from hybridoma cell lines. When compared to Sanger sequencing of two hybridoma cell lines, long-read ONT sequencing was highly accurate, reliable, and amenable to high throughput. We further show that the method is applicable to single cells, allowing efficient antibody discovery in rare populations such as memory B cells. In summary, NAb-seq promises to accelerate identification and validation of hybridoma antibodies as well as antibodies from single B cells used in research, diagnostics and therapeutics.",

(2018), and the concentration was determined using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer and NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Whole-genome sequencing of bacteriophage was carried out using Illumina NovaSeq 6,000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and Nanopore GridION X5 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom) technology. Sequencing libraries for Illumina were prepared according to the QIASeq FX DNA library preparation protocol using the QIASeq FX DNA kit. For nanopore sequencing library preparation, genomic DNA was end-primed by using the NEBnext ultra II end repair kit and cleaned up with AMPure beads. Native barcoding of end-primed samples was carried out with EXP-NBD104(ONT). Finally, the equimolar concentration of the barcode sample was ligated with a sequencing adaptor, purified with AMPure beads, and eluted in 15 \u03bcL of elution buffer. Raw reads obtained from Illumina and nanopore sequencing were de-multiplexed using Bcl2Fastq software v2.20 1 and guppy-v2.3.4  (Wick et al., 2019), respectively. Trimgalore-v0.4.02 tool and Commander v2.0.203 were used in Illumina sequencing, and Porechop-v0.2.34 and Nanofilt-v2.8.0 5 were used in Nanopore sequencing for trimming the raw reads and to assess their quality. The long read obtained from Nanopore sequencing and the short read obtained from Illumina were assembled using Unicycler v0.4.8. A hybrid sequencing approach was carried out for de novo assembly. Detailed information on the raw reads statistics is given in Supplementary Table S1.",

            "text": "The advent of single-molecule, third-generation sequencing technologies, mainly represented by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), marked the beginning of a new era in genomics [1]. Thus, many other \"-omics\" are quickly adapting to these technologies, further improving the accumulated scientific knowledge obtained during the past decades using short-read sequencing methods. Although Illumina (short read) is still a widely used sequencing platform for transcriptomic studies, it has some technological limitations that can be overcome using long-read sequencing [2][3][4]. The main limitations of short-read sequencing are that assembled transcripts from short reads do not cover full-length transcripts in eukaryotic genomes, and PCR amplification bias can be introduced during library construction [5,6]. Read lengths are over 15 kb for PacBio and Life 2021, 11, 862 2 of 20 30 kb for ONT, exceeding the length needed to cover most RNA molecules in eukaryotes [2]. Additionally, sample preparation for ONT long-read sequencing does not require PCR amplification, thus reducing possible bias, although with the consequence of reduced sequencing throughput [1,2,7]. Moreover, previous work comparing Illumina and ONT quantification of gene expression assessed the existence of a high level of correlation between the quantification of transcripts for both technologies [8][9][10][11], confirming that results obtained with ONT RNA-seq approaches are comparable to those obtained with short-read sequencing platforms. All of these characteristics make these two long-read sequencing technologies-ONT and PacBio-very attractive and suitable options for isoform and fusion transcript discovery and de novo transcriptomic analysis [12]. \n\nWhile encouraging, third-generation sequencing platforms are still improving, and analysis of long-read transcriptomes is still challenging. One of the main drawbacks of leveraging third-generation sequencing technologies is the relative lack of bioinformatic tools and standardized pipelines designed for downstream analysis [13].",

Addition of molecular barcodes would allow pooling of several samples to be run  simultaneously on one MinION flowcell. This, coupled with increasing speed, accuracy and throughput of MinION reads (e.g. results in Norris et al., 2016), will reduce the time and number of reads necessary for strain and variant identification, making this method amenable for diagnostic purposes. The relatively inexpensive and small-footprint MinION sequencers have been used in settings where conventional Illumina sequencing would be difficult (Quick et al., 2016).\n\nWe see the main application of our method of enriching long fragments in the detection of structural variants and in generating comprehensive coverage of specific target regions by long-read sequencing. Nanopore sequencing has previously been used to detect structural variants in pathogenic bacteria (Ashton et al., 2014), human DNA samples (Ammar et al., 2015) or human cancer cell lines (Norris et al., 2016); we believe our method could be employed as a non-amplicon-based alternative for this application, improving library complexity and uniformity of the sample, and aiding the detection of single-nucleotide variants (Samorodnitsky et al., 2015). As the enrichment approach is platform-agnostic, it could also be used to generate libraries compatible with the other long-read sequencers, benefitting the field of research into structural variation.",

            "text": "There is a need for techniques capable of identifying the antigenic epitopes targeted by polyclonal antibody responses during deliberate or natural immunization. Although successful, traditional phage library screening is laborious and can map only some of the epitopes. To accelerate and improve epitope identification, we have employed massive sequencing of phage-displayed antigen-specific libraries using the Illumina MiSeq platform. This enabled us to precisely identify the regions of a model antigen, the meningococcal NadA virulence factor, targeted by serum antibodies in vaccinated individuals and to rank hundreds of antigenic fragments according to their immunoreactivity. We found that next generation sequencing can significantly empower the analysis of antigen-specific libraries by allowing simultaneous processing of dozens of library/serum combinations in less than two days, including the time required for antibody-mediated library selection. Moreover, compared with traditional plaque picking, the new technology (named Phage-based Representation OF Immuno-Ligand Epitope Repertoire or PROFILER) provides superior resolution in epitope identification. PROFILER seems ideally suited to streamline and guide rational antigen design, adjuvant selection, and quality control of newly produced vaccines. Furthermore, this method is also susceptible to find important applications in other fields covered by traditional quantitative serology.",

Illumina and PGM library preparation can be performed with far less DNA; the standard PGM IonEXpress library prep requires just 100 ng DNA and Illumina sequencing has been performed from subnanogram quantities [27]. The yield, sample-input requirements and amplification-free library prep of PacBio potentially make it unsuitable for counting applications and for applications involving significant prior enrichment such as exome sequencing [15] and ChIP-seq [18]. The PacBio platform, by virtue of its long read lengths, should however have application in de novo sequencing and may also benefit analysis of linkage of alternative splicing and in of variants across long amplicons. Furthermore, the potential for direct detection of epigenetic modifications has been demonstrated [28].\n\nFinally, it should be noted that thus study represents a point in time, utilising kits and reagents available up until the end of 2011. Ion Torrent and Pacific Biosciences are relatively new sequencing technologies that have not had time to mature in the same way that the Illumina technology has. We anticipate that whilst some of the issues identified may be intrinsic, others will be resolved as these platforms evolve.",

These sequencing platforms intended to produce reads that are much longer than the older second-generation platforms, like Illumina, IonTorrent, and SOLiD, and may overcome most of the limitations associated with shortreads. One of the most common issues associated with genome assembly that uses short-reads is that repeated DNA regions, like simple sequence repetitions (SSRs) that are longer than the read length, are considered computationally impossible to assemble \"exactly\". However, today, the throughput of these new long-read sequencers is still low and has a relatively high error rate compared to alternative platforms. This indicates that many aspects of genome sequencing still require improvement. Additionally, sequencing by PacBio SMRT still very time consuming and expensive when compared to other platforms, such as IonTorrent PGM and Illumina MiSeq. Finally, the size of the raw files generated by PacBio SMRT and Oxford Nanopore are substantially larger than the ones for second-generation platforms, even for microbial genomes, what reflects the growing need for computational and storage resources in the context of NGS. \n\nFifteen years since the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium released the first draft, and 10 years after Roche released its 454 platform, DNA sequencing has undergone many changes, and many technologies have been released. Furthermore, it is possible that, in the near future, only a de novo assembly, without any read preprocessing or post-assembly improvement, will be enough to generate high-quality finished genomes. However, such procedures are nowadays still necessary to achieve a reliable result.",

For the fragment library, 100 ng of genomic DNA was sheared to \u03f3250 bp using a Covaris LE instrument and was prepared for sequencing as previously described (81). The \u03f32-kb jumping library was prepared using a 2-to-5-kb-insertion Illumina mate-pair library prep kit (V2; Illumina) as previously described (82). These libraries were sequenced by the use of the Broad Institute Genomics Platform on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system to generate paired 101-base reads. The genome of DSM27421 was sequenced from a small (\u03f3350-bp)-insertion-size library on a HiSeq 2500 system to generate 151 base reads. For PacBio sequencing, large (15-to-20-kb)-insertion-size libraries were generated and run on a PacBio RS II or Sequel (2.0 chemistry) system(s) (see Table S1 at https://figshare.com/s/80a83fe2c088854e7dee). PacBio sequencing and Illumina sequencing of DSM27421 were performed at the Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Core Facility of the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology. Nanopore sequencing was performed per the manufacturer's guidelines. Libraries were prepared by the use of a SQK-LSK108 one-dimensional (1D) ligation sequencing kit and were run for 48 h in R9 flow cells (FLO-MN106) using a MinION system.

            "text": "Long-read platforms offer the capability of generating sequences of tens or even hundreds of thousands of base pairs. These platforms, developed by companies such as PacBio (Menlo Park, California, USA) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford, United Kingdom), are sometimes referred to as \"third-generation\" technologies. Long reads have helped to facilitate the transition from the assembly of short reads (50-200 bp in length) to more efficient means of whole genome sequencing, with nearly 800 plant genomes sequenced (Marks et al., 2021). Moreover, short-read sequencing is challenging for taxa that are heavy in transposable elements (TEs), so long-read technology can also expand the taxonomic breadth of genome sequencing (Shahid and Slotkin, 2020). These technologies require high-molecular-weight DNA (fragments of 50 kbp or longer), which is generally obtained via modification of protocols that are designed for obtaining shorter fragment lengths from DNA samples with little degradation. \n\nTo that end, De La Cerda et al. ( 2023) present a series of straightforward modifications (including mortar and pestle vs. beads and cut vs. intact pipette tips) to standard protocols to use nanopore sequencing to enable plant evolutionary studies in Calochortus, which has relatively large genomes. Furthermore, the authors modified a sodium dodecyl sulfate-based DNA extraction protocol to promote less-contaminated DNA, which is critical for long-read sequencing technologies. Any modifications that can improve DNA length and quality result in a more efficient sequencing run, which is of primary concern for researchers working in clades that are known for having taxa with large genomes. \n\nIn a complementary fashion, Kang et al. (2023) performed a series of DNA extraction modifications to optimize long-read sequencing in a diverse set of taxa spanning 18 orders. Testing a protocol in diverse taxa is especially important as long-read sequencing continues to be a method of choice for biodiversity studies. The authors developed a protocol that combines a nuclear extraction method (to reduce organellar DNA) with a CTAB method, including important modifications to reduce problems associated with secondary metabolites. They compared their protocol to a commercial kit and found that the novel protocol resulted in longer DNA fragments and less contamination.",

            "text": "Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), both platforms being employed for the so called \"long-read sequencing\". While shortread sequencing technologies produce reads of up to 600 bases, long-read sequencing technologies produce reads in excess of 10 kb (154,156). Those long-read sequencing technologies have considerable advantages, including longer read lengths, the direct detection of epigenetic modifications, the capability to resolve repetitive elements, to allow the characterization of full-length transcriptomes and to allow variant phasing (155,157,158). Long-reads also carry more information about structural variation as compared to short-reads. Long-read sequencing is already considered the gold standard for some applications, as for instance the HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) typing for tissue transplants. The technology relies on the kinetics of polymerase incorporation of individual nucleotides, allowing the direct detection of these modified cytosines (160,161). The PacBio system was the first to be launched as \"third-generation sequencing\". Sequencing occurs into the so-called \"zero mode waveguides\" (ZMW), that are single pockets where DNA and polymerase bind to and where the signal is detected by the incorporation of phosphate-labeled nucleotides to the well (162). In the latest Sequel II system, the SMRT cells used for sequencing contain 8M ZMW which represents an improvement of the data output as compared to the previous SMRT cells that contain 1M ZMW.\n\nIn ONT sequencing single-stranded DNA molecules are driven into nanopores; when each nucleotide of the DNA strands partially obstructs the nanopore, an alteration of the electrical property is recorded and analyzed (163,164). Since the technology uses unmodified DNA, the major advantage consists into yielding results very quickly from minimal starting quantities. The first prototype of the platform consisted in the MinION that was launched in the market in 2014 (147).\n\nDespite the technical advantages of long-read sequencing technologies, their application in the field of cancer has been very limited. Cavalier and colleagues (165) employed SMRT sequencing for the detection of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) resistance mutations down to a level of 1% in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients",

These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) [20]. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running [20]. The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% [21]. As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running [20]. The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) [22]. Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity. \n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.",

            "text": "The inclusion of long read sequencing has become more commonplace since its introduction in 2009 [15], and subsequent technological advancements.There are two fundamental approaches to long-read sequencing: native (also referred to as third generation sequencing) and synthetic (SLR).Native long read platforms, such as those from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, can improve de novo assembly, mapping uncertainty and detection of structural variants [16], however, they are also prone to lower per read accuracies, while requiring higher input amounts and yielding less data [17][18][19].Synthetic long reads overcome those constraints by harnessing the accuracy and throughput provided by short-read sequencers.Comparisons of LoopSeq synthetic long reads to native long read platforms have previously been performed, and as such are not included in this paper [20][21][22].\n\nLong-read RNA sequencing is also essential to detect isoform expression and to quantify isoform mutation expression.Previously, we showed that the combination of intramolecular barcoding with short-read sequencing of RNA resulted in highly accurate synthetic long-read sequencing data [21].To investigate the ability to generate similarly accurate long read sequences on the AVITI platform, ERCC transcripts were intramolecularly barcoded, fragmented, and sequenced.As shown in Figure 4A, longread sequencing using AVITI and NovaSeq 6000 achieved similar quantification results in relation to the reference standard for all detected transcripts: 0.9617 for AVITI and 0.9588 for NovaSeq 6000.The correlations were slightly lower for both platforms (0.9561 for AVITI and 0.9542 for NovaSeq 6000), if only the full-length transcripts were considered.The base substitution error rate of long-read sequencing from AVITI was 0.051%, while insertion/deletion rate was 0.0075% (Figure 4B).On the other hand, NovaSeq 6000 had a base substitution error rate of 0.054% and insertion/deletion rate of 0.0099%.",

            "text": "of calling bases accurately in homopolymer runs combined with the limitations of short reads for correcting these errors when they occur in genomic regions with poor short read mappability. One new strategy to address this is to generate supplementary lower coverage data from high fidelity long read sequencing, for instance with PacBio HiFi (Nanopore versions are currently in development). New polishing tools are specifically designed to polish Nanopore assemblies with higher-fidelity reads (e.g. Shafin et al., 2021) and users should see greatly improved overall sequence accuracy.\n\nThis kind of hybrid long-read assembly approach may prove to be even more efficient than the assembly workflow we have presented. Interestingly, we find that high contiguity can be achieved Figure 6. Highly contiguous assemblies can be obtained with lower coverage of ultra-long reads. The NGx curve is shown for Drosophila jambulina assemblies at varying levels of coverage. The length of the assembly with the full data is assumed to be the genome size. Read sets used for each assembly were obtained by randomly downsampling the basecalled reads (read N50~27.5 kb) to varying (5\u00c2 to 30\u00c2) depth of coverage. Proportionally, these read sets contain~55% of total sequenced bases in reads longer than 25 kb,~25% of bases in reads longer than 50 kb, and~7% of bases in reads longer than 100 kb. Near chromosome scale assemblies (N50>20Mb) were achievable even at 15\u00c2 to 20\u00c2 depth with this read length distribution. This corresponds to approximately 8\u00c2 to 10\u00c2 depth in reads longer than 25 kb. even with minimal (10-20\u00c2) coverage of moderately long (read N50 25 kb) Nanopore reads (Figure 6). Similar coverage with even longer reads could serve as a cheap way to generate almost chromosome-level contigs, which will then be polished with higher fidelity long reads or Illumina reads. Ultra-long Nanopore sequencing is also significantly more accessible than before. Recently (as of March 2021), Oxford Nanopore and Circulomics released new ultra-long sequencing kits that, under ideal conditions, allows users to perform ultra-long Nanopore sequencing runs where read N50s exceed 100 kb while nearly doubling overall flow cell through",

For example, Somerville et al. tested the feasibility of a complete de novo metagenome-assembled genome (MAGs) from low-complexity microbiomes in a natural microbial community (of natural whey starter cultures (NWCs) used in cheese production) using long-read single-molecule sequencing data [118]. Two NWCs from Swiss Gruy\u00e8re producers were subjected to whole metagenome shotgun sequencing using a combination of Illumina Miseq (San Diego, CA, USA), PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION (Nanopore, Oxford, UK) to resolve repeat regions. They succeeded to achieve the complete assembly of all dominant bacterial chromosomes, bacterial plasmids and phages and a corresponding prophage. With the help of long-read sequencing, Somerville and his colleagues successfully covered both intra-genomic and inter-genomic repeats, which enabled them to discover biologically relevant information by linking plasmids and phages to their respective host genomes. These findings were obtained by detecting DNA methylation motifs on plasmids without the pre-treatment of the DNA (e.g., bisulfite conversion) and matching prokaryotic CRISPR spacers and their proto-spacers on phages. They illustrated that PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and ONT sequencing technologies were crucial instrumentals to achieve MAGs with the possibility to associate plasmids with their most likely bacterial host which was impossible to achieve using only short-reads. So far, WMGS studies have mainly relied on long-read sequencing, establishing that read length is essential for assigning the correct taxon and providing insight into different taxonomic groups during metagenomic analyses [119,120].",

To overcome these limitations, third generation sequencing technologies, single molecule sequencingbased technologies, were developed [47][48][49]. Pacific Biosciences (Menlo Park, CA, USA) (Pac Bio) single molecule realtime (SMRT) and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) are representatives of this generation [50]. \n\nPacBio SMRT technology does not require amplification and offers much longer reads than second generation sequencing technologies. The library preparation is similar to that of secondgeneration sequencing technologies, except that the adapters used in library preparation have a hairpin structure to ensure that the double-stranded DNA fragments become circular after ligation to form the SMRTbell template. The bases are sequenced by synthesis in real time on a chip containing millions of zero mode waveguides (ZMWs), which are nanowells several nanometers in diameter and approximately 100 nm in depth. The template molecule and DNA polymerase are immobilized at the bottom of each ZMW. During the sequencing reactions, the complementary strand of the template is elongated by DNA polymerase with fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. The CCD camera inside of the machine captures and records the fluorescent signals in real-time observation [48,50,51]. The first PacBio RS (PacBio) was released in 2011, with an average sequencing read length of approximately 1.5 kb [49,52]. Two years later, RS II was released, with an average read length of approximately 20 kb [48,53]. In 2015, PacBio launched a new SMRT system, Sequel, with larger cells and an increased number of ZMWs, which produces an average read length between 8-12 kb [53]. The upgraded Sequel II system can currently generate eight-fold the sequence data with 50% of the reads \u2265 50 kb.",

            "text": "Owing to technical restrictions, targeting sub-region sequencing for short fragments represents a historical compromise. For example, most of the 16 s rRNA gene sequencing based on NGS only amplifies a portion of the marker gene, providing relatively limited information for bacterial community characterization. The advent of innovative longread sequencing technologies, including the PacBio and Oxford nanopore platforms, has changed this and opened new avenues for microbiota studies (Jiao et al., 2013;Li et al., 2016). In addition to maintaining the features of high-throughput and in-depth sequencing, the read lengths are up to 1.0-1.5 \u00d7 10 4 and 2-5 \u00d7 10 3 for PacBio and Oxford nanopore single-molecule sequencing platforms, respectively (Mosher et al., 2014;Laver et al., 2015;van Dijk et al., 2018). However, TGS is capable of routinely generating reads in excess of 1,500 bp and completely covering the full 16S rRNA gene (Franzen et al., 2015;Schloss et al., 2016;Wagner et al., 2016). Previous studies have shown that TGS of the full-length (V1-V9) 16S rRNA gene using the PacBio technique generated sufficient accuracy to resolve subtle nucleotide variations for taxonomic analysis at species or even strain levels (Earl et al., 2018;Johnson et al., 2019). Moreover, TGS has additional advantages over NGS platforms for deciphering complex microbial ecosystems. For example, nanopore sequencing is mediated by the translation of an electrical signal into a sequence of nucleotides and does not involve nucleic acid amplification. In addition, nanopore sequencing can directly identify native base modifications and sequence viral RNA genomes in native status (Quick et al., 2016;Rand et al., 2017;Simpson et al., 2017;Garalde et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2019;Freed et al., 2020). Consequently, this substantially eliminates the biases introduced by PCR or reverse transcription. Many critical human diseases are caused by emerging RNA viruses such as COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Ebola.",

            "title": "Comparing genomes recovered from time-series metagenomes using long- and short-read sequencing technologies",
            "text": "In shotgun metagenomic approaches, limitations in the read length (i.e., ~ 100-250 bp sequences) often translate into fragmented reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with uncertain levels of genomic completion during de novo assembly. These complications are primarily due to highly repetitive regions, high levels of sequence microdiversity, multiple copies of genes, and AT-rich/GC-rich regions [1]. Overcoming these limitations is paramount to understanding the role of microorganisms in natural processes and analyzing their diversity in environmental and gut microbiomes. \n\nThe emergence of long-read sequencing technologies restores the hopes of overcoming these limitations in genomic sequence recovery. Sequencing platforms from Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can produce longer reads, although at the expense of a higher sequencing error rate and less sequencing depth compared to Illumina short-reads [2] (SR). For instance, the median length of reads ranges from 5 to 20 kbp and throughputs from 15 to 50 Gbp in LR technologies. Current sequencing chemistries yield observed modal read accuracies of 99.99%, 99.14%, and 99.9% for Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, and PacBio, respectively [3,4]. Moreover, advances in technological and bioinformatic approaches are closing the gaps between short-and longread sequencing technology applications, especially for recovering high-quality MAGs from the environment. Thus, long-read (LR) shotgun metagenomics is poised to set new standards for MAG quality. For instance, current PacBio Sequel II technology offers circular consensus sequencing (CCS), providing a low-error rate in high fidelity reads, although at a shorter read length than the traditional long-read technology [3]. Additionally, better genome statistics (low number of contigs and high N50 values) [5][6][7][8][9] or the combination of short-and longreads for the recovery of high-quality MAGs [10,11] have already showcased the benefits for the recovery of microbial genomes [12].",

If we were able to extract \u22651 \u03bcg of DNA, strains were also processed for long-read sequencing. For each strain, the appropriate volume for 1 \u03bcg of DNA was diluted with sterile, nucleasefree water to obtain the required 47 \u03bcl of DNA for the library preparation method described here. Half of the DNA solution (23.5 \u03bcl) was then sheared to a fragment size of \u223c20 Kbp by centrifuging in a g-TUBE (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) at 4,200 rpm for 1 min. Sequencing libraries were prepared from the mixture of sheared and unsheared DNA using the SQK-LSK109 Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc., Oxford, UK) following the manufacturer's Genomic DNA by Ligation protocol (version GDE_9063_v109_revAE_14Aug2019). The Short Fragment Buffer was used during the clean-up step to purify all fragments equally. DNA repair and endprep was performed using the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair and Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing modules (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The library was loaded into a FLO-MIN106 flow cell and sequenced with a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc.) for \u223c48 h using the MinKNOW application (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc.).

Here, we show that high-quality recombinant polyclonals, in which hundreds of different antibodies are all directed toward a target of interest, can be easily generated in vitro by combining phage and yeast display. We show that, unlike traditional polyclonals, which are limited resources, recombinant polyclonal antibodies can be amplified over one hundred million-fold without losing representation or functionality. Our protocol was tested on 9 different targets to demonstrate how the strategy allows the selective amplification of antibodies directed toward desirable target specific epitopes, such as those found in one protein but not a closely related one, and the elimination of antibodies recognizing common epitopes, without significant loss of diversity. These recombinant renewable polyclonal antibodies are usable in different assays, and can be generated in high throughput. This approach could potentially be used to develop highly specific recombinant renewable antibodies against all human gene products.",

After sequencing in vitro selected populations, clones are binned into identical or similar groups and ordered by abundance, allowing identification of those that are most enriched. However, the greatest strength of deep sequencing is also its greatest weakness: clones are easily identified by their DNA sequences, but are not physically available for testing without a laborious multistep process involving several rounds of polymerization chain reaction (PCR), assembly and cloning. Here, using the isolation of antibody genes from a phage and yeast display selection as an example, we show the power of a rapid and simple inverse PCR-based method to easily isolate clones identified by deep sequencing. Once primers have been received, clone isolation can be carried out in a single day, rather than two days. Furthermore the reduced number of PCRs required will reduce PCR mutations correspondingly. We have observed a 100% success rate in amplifying clones with an abundance as low as 0.5% in a polyclonal population. This approach allows us to obtain full-length clones even when an incomplete sequence is available, and greatly simplifies the subcloning process. Moreover, rarer, but functional clones missed by traditional screening can be easily isolated using this method, and the approach can be extended to any selected library (scFv, cDNA, libraries based on scaffold proteins) where a unique sequence signature for the desired clones of interest is available.",

For this reason, HCDR3s have been used as unique identifiers to investigate adaptive immune responses in vivo and to characterize in vitro selection outputs where display systems were employed. Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding."

However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics."

Previous studies using earlier versions of sequencing chemistries have at most been able to finish bacterial genomes containing only one chromosome with de novo assembly. In this study, we compared the robustness of PacBio RS II, using one SMRT cell and the latest P6-C4 chemistry, with Illumina HiSeq 1500 in sequencing the genome of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium which contains two large circular chromosomes, very high G+C content of 68\u201369%, highly repetitive regions and substantial genomic diversity, and represents one of the largest and most complex bacterial genomes sequenced, using a reference genome generated by hybrid assembly using PacBio and Illumina datasets with subsequent manual validation. Results showed that PacBio data with de novo assembly, but not Illumina, was able to completely sequence the B. pseudomallei genome without any gaps or mis-assemblies. The two large contigs of the PacBio assembly aligned unambiguously to the reference genome, sharing >99.9% nucleotide identities. Conversely, Illumina data assembled using three different assemblers resulted in fragmented assemblies (201\u2013366 contigs), sharing only 92.2\u2013100% and 92.0\u2013100% nucleotide identities to chromosomes I and II reference sequences, respectively, with no indication that the B. pseudomallei genome consisted of two chromosomes with four copies of ribosomal operons. Among all assemblies, the PacBio assembly recovered the highest number of core and virulence proteins, and housekeeping genes based on whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST). Most notably, assembly solely based on PacBio outperformed even hybrid assembly using both PacBio and Illumina datasets. Hybrid approach generated only 74 contigs, while the PacBio data alone with de novo assembly achieved complete closure of the two-chromosome B. pseudomallei genome without additional costly bench work and further sequencing. PacBio RS II using P6-C4 chemistry is highly robust and cost-effective and should be the platform of choice in sequencing bacterial genomes, particularly for those that are well-known to be difficult-to-sequence.",

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries.",

Our PhageXpress technique is combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION sequencer and custom bioinformatics to achieve high-throughput screening of phage libraries. We performed 4 rounds of biopanning against Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) using traditional methods (4 week turnaround), which resulted in the isolation of 19 unique scFv clones. We validated the feasibility and efficiency of the PhageXpress method utilizing the same phage library and antigen target. Notably, we successfully mapped 14 of the 19 anti-NS1 scFv sequences (\u223c74%) with our new method, despite using \u223c30-fold less particles during screening and conducting only a single round of biopanning.

Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are key for modeling human immune responses, placing critical importance on the accurate annotation and quantification of their Ig and TCR repertoires. However, because of incomplete reference resources, the coverage and accuracy of the traditional targeted amplification strategies for profiling rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires are largely unknown. In this study, using long read sequencing, we sequenced four Indian-origin rhesus macaque tissues and obtained high-quality, full-length sequences for over 6000 unique Ig and TCR transcripts, without the need for sequence assembly. We constructed, to our knowledge, the first complete reference set for the constant regions of all known isotypes and chain types of rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires. We show that sequence diversity exists across the entire variable regions of rhesus Ig and TCR transcripts. Consequently, existing strategies using targeted amplification of rearranged variable regions comprised of V(D)J gene segments miss a significant fraction (27\u201353% and 42\u201349%) of rhesus Ig/TCR diversity. To overcome these limitations, we designed new rhesus-specific assays that remove the need for primers conventionally targeting variable regions and allow single cell level Ig and TCR repertoire analysis.

The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications."

(H\u00e9madou et al., 2017) Previously, reading both the heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable domains that constitute single chain variable fragments (scFvs) was a challenge due to the limitation of most NGS platforms to fragments of 500 bp, while scFvs typically span around 850 base pairs (bp). (Glanville et al., 2015) Fully sequencing both chains is particularly valuable. Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, (Akbar et al., 2019) with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, (Xu et al., 2000) evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding. (Kunik et al., 2012) Furthermore, the light chain plays a role in specificity, (D\u2019Angelo et al., 2018) with specific regions influencing the structure of the HCDR3 loop. (Guloglu et al., 2023) Therefore, sequencing the entire scFv provides crucial information for identifying better binders. (Levin et al., 2023) he advent of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing on PacBio platforms has already enabled the identification of antibodies with a diverse range of affinities, epitopes and biophysical characteristics, by leveraging full-length scFvs information in in vitro display libraries.

However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries.",

However, we have shown that up to 22% of the residues that actually bind the antigen fall outside the traditionally defined CDRs. The Paratome web server predicts the ABRs of an antibody, given its amino acid sequence or 3D structure. It is based on a set of consensus regions derived from a structural alignment of a non-redundant set of all known antibody\u2013antigen complexes. Given a query sequence or structure, the server identifies the regions in the query antibody that correspond to the consensus ABRs.

A fundamental premise for the predictability of paratope-epitope interactions is the existence of structural units that are universally shared among antibody-antigen binding complexes. Here, we screened the largest available set of non-redundant antibody-antigen structures for binding patterns and identified structural interaction motifs, which together compose a vocabulary of paratope-epitope interactions that is universally shared among investigated antibody-antigen structures. The vocabulary (i) is compact, less than 104 motifs, (ii) is immunity-specific and distinct from non-immune protein-protein interactions, (iii) mediates specific oligo- and polyreactive interactions between paratope-epitope pairs, and (iv) enables the machine learnability of paratope-epitope interactions.

Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data.",

It has long been known that the VH CDRs contribute more heavily to the antigen-binding surface (paratope), with the CDR-H3 loop providing a major modality for the generation of diverse paratopes. Here, we provide evidence for an additional role of the VL domain as a modulator of CDR-H3 structure, using a diverse set of antibody crystal structures and a large set of molecular dynamics simulations. We show that specific attributes of the VL domain such as CDR canonical forms and genes can influence the structural diversity of the CDR-H3 loop, and provide a physical model for how this effect occurs through inter-loop contacts and packing of CDRs against each other. Our study provides insights into the interdependent nature of CDR conformations, an understanding of which is important for the rational antibody design process.",

Surprisingly, our investigation into the correlation between NGS-derived frequencies of CDRs and affinity revealed a lack of association, although this limitation could be moderately mitigated by leveraging NGS clustering, enrichment and/or relative abundance across different regions to enhance lead prioritization. This study highlights NGS benefits, offering insights, recommendations, and the most effective approach to leverage NGS in therapeutic antibody discovery.",
                    "[3750653 | D'Angelo et al. | 2018 | Citations: 74]": "Because of its great potential for diversity, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) is taken as an antibody molecule\u2019s most important component in conferring binding activity and specificity. For this reason, HCDR3s have been used as unique identifiers to investigate adaptive immune responses in vivo and to characterize in vitro selection outputs where display systems were employed. Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding."

(H\u00e9madou et al., 2017) Previously, reading both the heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable domains that constitute single chain variable fragments (scFvs) was a challenge due to the limitation of most NGS platforms to fragments of 500 bp, while scFvs typically span around 850 base pairs (bp). (Glanville et al., 2015) Fully sequencing both chains is particularly valuable. Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, (Akbar et al., 2019) with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, (Xu et al., 2000) evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding. (Kunik et al., 2012) Furthermore, the light chain plays a role in specificity, (D\u2019Angelo et al., 2018) with specific regions influencing the structure of the HCDR3 loop. (Guloglu et al., 2023) Therefore, sequencing the entire scFv provides crucial information for identifying better binders. (Levin et al., 2023) he advent of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing on PacBio platforms has already enabled the identification of antibodies with a diverse range of affinities, epitopes and biophysical characteristics, by leveraging full-length scFvs information in in vitro display libraries.

Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries."

As a test case, we analyzed the PGT121 class of antibodies from IAVI donor 17, an HIV-1-infected individual.

Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data.",

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology enabled the sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulins (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissues have high affinities for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of their amino acid sequences and other sequence-independent features such as the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) may differ between the normal and tumor microenvironments. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rarity of recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCR/Ig sequences than in TCR sequences. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of discriminating BCRs/Igs in tumor and in normal tissues, by capturing these differences using supervised machine learning methods applied to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs. RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs were obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens from 90 gastric cancer patients. BCR/Ig-features obtained in Rep-Seq were used to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. Different machine learning models using various features were constructed as well as gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier combining these models. The results demonstrated that BCR/Ig sequences between normal and tumor microenvironments exhibit their differences. Next, by using a GBM trained to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences, we tried to classify sets of BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. As a result, an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.826 was achieved, suggesting that BCR/Ig repertoires have distinct sequence-level features in normal and tumor tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that BCR/Ig sequences derived from tumor and normal tissues have globally distinct patterns, and that these tissues can be effectively differentiated using BCR/Ig repertoires."

While CDR3 sequences and single-domain antibody genes could be successfully determined using systems like MiSeq, the sequencing of entire single-chain variable fragments (scFv), which contain 750-800 bases, remained challenging with these earlier platforms. <Paper corpusId=\"2340454\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> However, ongoing technological developments have addressed these limitations, with newer systems like PacBio Sequel offering improved depth while maintaining long-read capabilities, and nanopore systems such as Oxford Nanopore's MinIOn providing real-time DNA sequencing with ultra-long reads. <Paper corpusId=\"3573710\" paperTitle=\"(Rouet et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> These technological advances have positioned NGS to provide unique sequence insights into all stages of the antibody selection process in phage display libraries.",

Information gained from high-throughput DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes (Ig-seq) can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high sensitivity, to discover antibodies specific for antigens of interest, to guide vaccine development and to understand autoimmunity. Rapid progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different laboratories."

This approach allowed for in depth analysis of the library\u2019s diversity, provided sequence information on virtually all scFv during selection for binding to two targets and a global view of these enrichment processes. Using the most frequent heavy chain CDR3 sequences, primers were designed to rescue scFv from the third selection round. Identification, based on sequence frequency, retrieved the most potent scFv and valuable candidates that were missed using classical in vitro screening. Thus, by combining NGS with display technologies, laborious and time consuming upfront screening can be by-passed or complemented and valuable insights into the selection process can be obtained to improve library design and understanding of antibody repertoires."

                            "Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology revolutionized sequencing, offering a tremendous sequencing capacity with groundbreaking depth and accuracy, it continues to demonstrate serious limitations. In the early 2010s, the introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT), gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications."

                            "The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5\u2009kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the \u2018genome in a bottle\u2019 (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15\u2009megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads. High-fidelity reads improve variant detection and genome assembly on the PacBio platform."

                            "The wide implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the field of medical genetics. However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics."

                            "In recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65]. The implementation of long accurate reads and the recent introduction of sample multiplexing by barcoding renders the third-generation sequencing platforms very useful to obtain quantitative information of full-length antibody fragments (scFv, Fab) from library screenings. To date, these technologies are still very rarely applied to the screening of antibody libraries, but the recent improvements and a more widespread availability of instruments are paving the way to their more diffused application (Figure 2) [66][67][68]."

(H\u00e9madou et al., 2017) Previously, reading both the heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable domains that constitute single chain variable fragments (scFvs) was a challenge due to the limitation of most NGS platforms to fragments of 500 bp, while scFvs typically span around 850 base pairs (bp). (Glanville et al., 2015) Fully sequencing both chains is particularly valuable. Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, (Akbar et al., 2019) with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, (Xu et al., 2000) evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding. (Kunik et al., 2012) Furthermore, the light chain plays a role in specificity, (D\u2019Angelo et al., 2018) with specific regions influencing the structure of the HCDR3 loop. (Guloglu et al., 2023) Therefore, sequencing the entire scFv provides crucial information for identifying better binders.

                            "Antibodies are capable of specifically recognizing and binding antigens. Identification of the antigen-binding site, commonly dubbed paratope, is of high importance both for medical and biological applications. To date, the identification of antigen-binding regions (ABRs) relies on tools for the identification of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). However, we have shown that up to 22% of the residues that actually bind the antigen fall outside the traditionally defined CDRs. The Paratome web server predicts the ABRs of an antibody, given its amino acid sequence or 3D structure. It is based on a set of consensus regions derived from a structural alignment of a non-redundant set of all known antibody\u2013antigen complexes. Given a query sequence or structure, the server identifies the regions in the query antibody that correspond to the consensus ABRs. An independent set of antibody\u2013antigen complexes was used to test the server and it was shown to correctly identify at least 94% of the antigen-binding residues. The Paratome web server is freely available at http://www.ofranlab.org/paratome/."

                            "Because of its great potential for diversity, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) is taken as an antibody molecule\u2019s most important component in conferring binding activity and specificity. For this reason, HCDR3s have been used as unique identifiers to investigate adaptive immune responses in vivo and to characterize in vitro selection outputs where display systems were employed. Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding."

By contrast, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has a much lower capital cost and flexible throughput, with raw-read accuracy having improved in recent years to >95%, enabling its use for the sequencing of phage display outputs. (Raftery et al., 2019) However, the remaining errors in ONT, notably systematic homopolymer errors (insertions/deletions in tracts of >5 identical bases) can lead to frameshifts, complicating translation of nanopore-derived sequences into accurate antibody protein sequences. 24"

                            "Phage display methodologies offer a versatile platform for the isolation of single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules which may be rebuilt into monoclonal antibodies. Herein, we report on a complete workflow termed PhageXpress, for rapid selection of single-chain Fv sequences by leveraging electrohydrodynamic-manipulation of a solution containing phage library particles to enhance target binding whilst minimizing non-specific interactions. Our PhageXpress technique is combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION sequencer and custom bioinformatics to achieve high-throughput screening of phage libraries. We performed 4 rounds of biopanning against Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) using traditional methods (4 week turnaround), which resulted in the isolation of 19 unique scFv clones. We validated the feasibility and efficiency of the PhageXpress method utilizing the same phage library and antigen target. Notably, we successfully mapped 14 of the 19 anti-NS1 scFv sequences (\u223c74%) with our new method, despite using \u223c30-fold less particles during screening and conducting only a single round of biopanning. We believe this approach supersedes traditional methods for the discovery of bio-recognition molecules such as antibodies by speeding up the process for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic biologics."

                            "Therapeutic antibody discovery often relies on in-vitro display methods to identify lead candidates. Assessing selected output diversity traditionally involves random colony picking and Sanger sequencing, which has limitations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers a cost-effective solution with increased read depth, allowing a comprehensive understanding of diversity. Our study establishes NGS guidelines for antibody drug discovery, demonstrating its advantages in expanding the number of unique HCDR3 clusters, broadening the number of high affinity antibodies, expanding the total number of antibodies recognizing different epitopes, and improving lead prioritization. Surprisingly, our investigation into the correlation between NGS-derived frequencies of CDRs and affinity revealed a lack of association, although this limitation could be moderately mitigated by leveraging NGS clustering, enrichment and/or relative abundance across different regions to enhance lead prioritization. This study highlights NGS benefits, offering insights, recommendations, and the most effective approach to leverage NGS in therapeutic antibody discovery."

                            "Abstract Deep parallel sequencing (NGS) is a viable tool for monitoring scFv and Fab library dynamics in many antibody engineering high-throughput screening efforts. Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data."

                            "B-cell repertoire analysis using next-generation sequencing has become a valuable tool for interrogating the genetic record of humoral response to infection. However, key obstacles such as low throughput, short read length, high error rate and undetermined bias of multiplex PCR method have hindered broader application of this technology. In this study, we report several technical advances in antibody repertoire sequencing. We first demonstrated the ability to sequence antibody variable domains using the Ion Torrent PGM platform. As a test case, we analyzed the PGT121 class of antibodies from IAVI donor 17, an HIV-1-infected individual. We then obtained \"unbiased\" antibody repertoires by sequencing the 5\u2032-RACE PCR products of B-cell transcripts from IAVI donor 17 and two HIV-1-uninfected individuals. We also quantified the bias of previously published gene-specific primers by comparing the repertoires generated by 5\u2032-RACE PCR and multiplex PCR. We further developed a single-molecule barcoding strategy to reduce PCR-based amplification noise. Lastly, we evaluated several new PGM technologies in the context of antibody sequencing. We expect that, based upon long-read and high-fidelity next-generation sequencing technologies, the unbiased analysis will provide a more accurate view of the overall antibody repertoire while the barcoding strategy will facilitate high-resolution analysis of individual antibody families."

                            "The recent success of immunotherapy in treating tumors has attracted increasing interest in research related to the adaptive immune system in the tumor microenvironment. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology enabled the sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulins (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissues have high affinities for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of their amino acid sequences and other sequence-independent features such as the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) may differ between the normal and tumor microenvironments. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rarity of recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCR/Ig sequences than in TCR sequences. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of discriminating BCRs/Igs in tumor and in normal tissues, by capturing these differences using supervised machine learning methods applied to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs. RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs were obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens from 90 gastric cancer patients. BCR/Ig-features obtained in Rep-Seq were used to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. Different machine learning models using various features were constructed as well as gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier combining these models. The results demonstrated that BCR/Ig sequences between normal and tumor microenvironments exhibit their differences. Next, by using a GBM trained to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences, we tried to classify sets of BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. As a result, an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.826 was achieved, suggesting that BCR/Ig repertoires have distinct sequence-level features in normal and tumor tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that BCR/Ig sequences derived from tumor and normal tissues have globally distinct patterns, and that these tissues can be effectively differentiated using BCR/Ig repertoires."

                            "The screening of this library would be greatly improved with the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as Illumina, however often NGS platforms are limited in the length of the reads (\u2264400 bp), covering at most one VH or VL domain per read. This limitation has been addressed through the use of alternate high throughput NGS platforms such as the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) S5 and the Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) RSII and Sequel systems (40,41). Using the PGM-S5 system, He et al. generated 900 bp sequencing reads to identify precursors and lineage intermediates of HIV-1 bnAbs from a phage display library. Although single chain fragment variables (scFvs) from this combinatorial library did not necessarily represent authentic VH-VL pairing, the authors were able to validate their data using biopanning onto a native-like gp140 trimer and comparison with previously characterized bnAb lineages (42)(43)(44)(45)(46)(47)(48)(49). Using the PacBio RSII system, Hemadou et al. generated long reads (>800 bp) covering full length scFvs following in vivo panning in an animal model of atherosclerosis."

                "text": "\nWhile long-read sequencing technologies offer tremendous advantages for antibody fragment analysis in phage display libraries, their adoption was initially hindered by significant technical challenges. Early iterations of third-generation sequencing platforms from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore suffered from prohibitively high error rates exceeding 10% and relatively low throughput compared to short-read technologies <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248872718\" paperTitle=\"(Amoutzias et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These limitations posed particular problems for antibody sequence analysis, where even single nucleotide errors could result in frameshift mutations or amino acid substitutions that compromise accurate protein translation.\n\nA transformative breakthrough came with PacBio's development of circular consensus sequencing (CCS), which enables multiple passes over a single DNA molecule to dramatically reduce error rates <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248872718\" paperTitle=\"(Amoutzias et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"199542686\" paperTitle=\"(Wenger et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This innovation led to the generation of high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads with error rates below 1%, making the technology substantially more reliable for antibody sequence determination <Paper corpusId=\"248872718\" paperTitle=\"(Amoutzias et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Concurrently, Oxford Nanopore Technologies has made similar progress with their R.10 chemistry achieving consensus error rates of less than 1% <Paper corpusId=\"248872718\" paperTitle=\"(Amoutzias et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHardware improvements have accompanied these advances in sequencing chemistry. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system can now generate reads averaging 10-15 kb in length while producing 500 Gb of data within just 30 hours <Paper corpusId=\"248872718\" paperTitle=\"(Amoutzias et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

While PacBio sequencing has been successfully applied to single B cell analysis, phage display libraries, and repertoire sequencing, its higher cost has limited routine implementation <Paper corpusId=\"247749291\" paperTitle=\"(Satish et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15202080\" paperTitle=\"(Vollmers et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3577857\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"8314507\" paperTitle=\"(Hemadou et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218535112\" paperTitle=\"(Brochu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, Oxford Nanopore Technologies offers a more accessible entry point with lower capital costs and flexible throughput options, making it increasingly attractive for phage display applications <Paper corpusId=\"247749291\" paperTitle=\"(Satish et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207961686\" paperTitle=\"(Raftery et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nComputational advances have been equally critical in overcoming technical challenges. Improved bioinformatics algorithms, such as Nanopore's Bonito, have significantly enhanced base-calling accuracy and reduced systematic errors <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, persistent challenges remain, particularly with Oxford Nanopore's systematic homopolymer errors that can lead to insertions or deletions in tracts of identical bases, potentially causing frameshifts that complicate accurate translation of antibody sequences <Paper corpusId=\"247749291\" paperTitle=\"(Satish et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address these issues, novel error-correction methods like single-cell corrected long-read sequencing (scCOLOR-seq) have been developed, enabling error detection in barcode and unique molecular identifier sequences <Paper corpusId=\"247749291\" paperTitle=\"(Satish et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235709982\" paperTitle=\"(Philpott et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn emerging application of long-read sequencing that has particular relevance for phage display is the detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation patterns <Paper corpusId=\"274166295\" paperTitle=\"(Papudeshi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16152628\" paperTitle=\"(Simpson et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258866736\" paperTitle=\"(Sun et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These epigenetic features may influence phage resistance mechanisms and adaptability within microbial communities, adding another dimension to the characterization of phage display libraries.\n\nAs these technical challenges continue to be addressed through ongoing improvements in chemistry, hardware, and computational methods, long-read sequencing technologies are becoming increasingly accessible and reliable tools for comprehensive analysis of antibody fragments in phage display libraries.",

                            "In recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65]. The implementation of long accurate reads and the recent introduction of sample multiplexing by barcoding renders the third-generation sequencing platforms very useful to obtain quantitative information of full-length antibody fragments (scFv, Fab) from library screenings. To date, these technologies are still very rarely applied to the screening of antibody libraries, but the recent improvements and a more widespread availability of instruments are paving the way to their more diffused application (Figure 2) [66][67][68]."

                            "Over the last decade, third-generation long-read sequencing technologies have emerged to address the limitations referred to above, most notably from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Korlach et al., 2010) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [19]. These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% (Wenger et al., 2019). As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%."

                            "The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5\u2009kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the \u2018genome in a bottle\u2019 (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15\u2009megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads. High-fidelity reads improve variant detection and genome assembly on the PacBio platform."

(Philpott et al., 2021) PacBio long-read sequencing has been applied to the sequencing of single B cells, (Vollmers et al., 2015) phage display libraries, (Han et al., 2018)(H\u00e9madou et al., 2017) and repertoire sequencing, (Brochu et al., 2020) but its high cost makes it difficult to implement routinely. By contrast, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has a much lower capital cost and flexible throughput, with raw-read accuracy having improved in recent years to >95%, enabling its use for the sequencing of phage display outputs. (Raftery et al., 2019) However, the remaining errors in ONT, notably systematic homopolymer errors (insertions/deletions in tracts of >5 identical bases) can lead to frameshifts, complicating translation of nanopore-derived sequences into accurate antibody protein sequences. 24"

The constant region of the antibody heavy chain is encoded by multiple groups of exons which define the isotype and therefore many functional characteristics of the antibody. We performed both single B cell RNAseq and long read single molecule sequencing of antibody heavy chain transcripts and were able to identify novel exons for IGHA1 and IGHA2 as well as novel isoforms for IGHM antibody heavy chain."

                            "The screening of this library would be greatly improved with the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as Illumina, however often NGS platforms are limited in the length of the reads (\u2264400 bp), covering at most one VH or VL domain per read. This limitation has been addressed through the use of alternate high throughput NGS platforms such as the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) S5 and the Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) RSII and Sequel systems (40,41). Using the PGM-S5 system, He et al. generated 900 bp sequencing reads to identify precursors and lineage intermediates of HIV-1 bnAbs from a phage display library. Although single chain fragment variables (scFvs) from this combinatorial library did not necessarily represent authentic VH-VL pairing, the authors were able to validate their data using biopanning onto a native-like gp140 trimer and comparison with previously characterized bnAb lineages (42)(43)(44)(45)(46)(47)(48)(49). Using the PacBio RSII system, Hemadou et al. generated long reads (>800 bp) covering full length scFvs following in vivo panning in an animal model of atherosclerosis."

                            "Key Points PacBio Iso-Seq enables generation of immune repertoire C region references. Full-length CCS reads benchmark targeted immune repertoire assay efficiencies. The diversity of Ig and TCR repertoires is a focal point of immunological studies. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are key for modeling human immune responses, placing critical importance on the accurate annotation and quantification of their Ig and TCR repertoires. However, because of incomplete reference resources, the coverage and accuracy of the traditional targeted amplification strategies for profiling rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires are largely unknown. In this study, using long read sequencing, we sequenced four Indian-origin rhesus macaque tissues and obtained high-quality, full-length sequences for over 6000 unique Ig and TCR transcripts, without the need for sequence assembly. We constructed, to our knowledge, the first complete reference set for the constant regions of all known isotypes and chain types of rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires. We show that sequence diversity exists across the entire variable regions of rhesus Ig and TCR transcripts. Consequently, existing strategies using targeted amplification of rearranged variable regions comprised of V(D)J gene segments miss a significant fraction (27\u201353% and 42\u201349%) of rhesus Ig/TCR diversity. To overcome these limitations, we designed new rhesus-specific assays that remove the need for primers conventionally targeting variable regions and allow single cell level Ig and TCR repertoire analysis. Our improved approach will enable future studies to fully capture rhesus Ig and TCR repertoire diversity and is applicable for improving annotations in any model organism."

                            "Phage display methodologies offer a versatile platform for the isolation of single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules which may be rebuilt into monoclonal antibodies. Herein, we report on a complete workflow termed PhageXpress, for rapid selection of single-chain Fv sequences by leveraging electrohydrodynamic-manipulation of a solution containing phage library particles to enhance target binding whilst minimizing non-specific interactions. Our PhageXpress technique is combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION sequencer and custom bioinformatics to achieve high-throughput screening of phage libraries. We performed 4 rounds of biopanning against Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) using traditional methods (4 week turnaround), which resulted in the isolation of 19 unique scFv clones. We validated the feasibility and efficiency of the PhageXpress method utilizing the same phage library and antigen target. Notably, we successfully mapped 14 of the 19 anti-NS1 scFv sequences (\u223c74%) with our new method, despite using \u223c30-fold less particles during screening and conducting only a single round of biopanning. We believe this approach supersedes traditional methods for the discovery of bio-recognition molecules such as antibodies by speeding up the process for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic biologics."

                            "DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the survival of bacteriophages (phages), yet the understanding of their genome methylation remains limited. In this study, DNA methylation patterns are analyzed in 8848 metagenome\u2010assembled high\u2010quality phages from 104 fecal samples using single\u2010molecule real\u2010time sequencing. The results demonstrate that 97.60% of gut phages exhibit methylation, with certain factors correlating with methylation densities. Phages with higher methylation densities appear to have potential viability advantages. Strikingly, more than one\u2010third of the phages possess their own DNA methyltransferases (MTases). Increased MTase copies are associated with higher genome methylation densities, specific methylation motifs, and elevated prevalence of certain phage groups. Notably, the majority of these MTases share close homology with those encoded by gut bacteria, suggesting their exchange during phage\u2013bacterium interactions. Furthermore, these MTases can be employed to accurately predict phage\u2013host relationships. Overall, the findings indicate the widespread utilization of DNA methylation by gut DNA phages as an evasion mechanism against host defense systems, with a substantial contribution from phage\u2010encoded MTases."

Recent technical and bioinformatic advances have yielded ultra-long reads (up to 25 kilobases) with dramatically improved accuracy (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore), providing increasingly reliable full-length antibody fragment sequencing. <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> Additionally, the introduction of sample multiplexing through barcoding is making these platforms more accessible and cost-effective for routine library screening applications. <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAn emerging application of long-read sequencing is the comprehensive characterization of antibody structural relationships.

                            "In parallel to advancements in bioinformatics methods, the innovative application of Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) longread HiFi sequencing to in vitro display libraries has enabled the high-throughput full-length sequencing of recombinant antibodies. (H\u00e9madou et al., 2017) Previously, reading both the heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable domains that constitute single chain variable fragments (scFvs) was a challenge due to the limitation of most NGS platforms to fragments of 500 bp, while scFvs typically span around 850 base pairs (bp). (Glanville et al., 2015) Fully sequencing both chains is particularly valuable. Indeed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are known to play a significant role in binding, (Akbar et al., 2019) with the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) being crucial for antibody specificity, (Xu et al., 2000) evidence suggests that other regions also contribute to binding. (Kunik et al., 2012) Furthermore, the light chain plays a role in specificity, (D\u2019Angelo et al., 2018) with specific regions influencing the structure of the HCDR3 loop. (Guloglu et al., 2023) Therefore, sequencing the entire scFv provides crucial information for identifying better binders. (Levin et al., 2023) he advent of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing on PacBio platforms has already enabled the identification of antibodies with a diverse range of affinities, epitopes and biophysical characteristics, by leveraging full-length scFvs information in in vitro display libraries. (Nannini et al., 2020)(Erasmus et al., 2023)",
                            "In theory, Seq2scFv should be able to handle scFv sequences generated by any long-read sequencing platform, including newer generations of PacBio sequencers and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, as the framework is independent of pre-processing and only requires paired VH-VL sequences in FASTA format."

                            "In recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65]. The implementation of long accurate reads and the recent introduction of sample multiplexing by barcoding renders the third-generation sequencing platforms very useful to obtain quantitative information of full-length antibody fragments (scFv, Fab) from library screenings. To date, these technologies are still very rarely applied to the screening of antibody libraries, but the recent improvements and a more widespread availability of instruments are paving the way to their more diffused application (Figure 2) [66][67][68]."

                            "Because of its great potential for diversity, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) is taken as an antibody molecule\u2019s most important component in conferring binding activity and specificity. For this reason, HCDR3s have been used as unique identifiers to investigate adaptive immune responses in vivo and to characterize in vitro selection outputs where display systems were employed. Here, we show that many different HCDR3s can be identified within a target-specific antibody population after in vitro selection. For each identified HCDR3, a number of different antibodies bearing differences elsewhere can be found. In such selected populations, all antibodies with the same HCDR3 recognize the target, albeit at different affinities. In contrast, within unselected populations, the majority of antibodies with the same HCDR3 sequence do not bind the target. In one HCDR3 examined in depth, all target-specific antibodies were derived from the same VDJ rearrangement, while non-binding antibodies with the same HCDR3 were derived from many different V and D gene rearrangements. Careful examination of previously published in vivo datasets reveals that HCDR3s shared between, and within, different individuals can also originate from rearrangements of different V and D genes, with up to 26 different rearrangements yielding the same identical HCDR3 sequence. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the same HCDR3 can be generated by many different rearrangements, but that specific target binding is an outcome of unique rearrangements and VL pairing: the HCDR3 is necessary, albeit insufficient, for specific antibody binding."

                            "Antibodies, through their ability to target virtually any epitope, play a key role in driving the adaptive immune response in jawed vertebrates. The binding domains of standard antibodies are their variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) domains, both of which present analogous complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops. It has long been known that the VH CDRs contribute more heavily to the antigen-binding surface (paratope), with the CDR-H3 loop providing a major modality for the generation of diverse paratopes. Here, we provide evidence for an additional role of the VL domain as a modulator of CDR-H3 structure, using a diverse set of antibody crystal structures and a large set of molecular dynamics simulations. We show that specific attributes of the VL domain such as CDR canonical forms and genes can influence the structural diversity of the CDR-H3 loop, and provide a physical model for how this effect occurs through inter-loop contacts and packing of CDRs against each other. Our study provides insights into the interdependent nature of CDR conformations, an understanding of which is important for the rational antibody design process."

                            "Therapeutic antibody discovery often relies on in-vitro display methods to identify lead candidates. Assessing selected output diversity traditionally involves random colony picking and Sanger sequencing, which has limitations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers a cost-effective solution with increased read depth, allowing a comprehensive understanding of diversity. Our study establishes NGS guidelines for antibody drug discovery, demonstrating its advantages in expanding the number of unique HCDR3 clusters, broadening the number of high affinity antibodies, expanding the total number of antibodies recognizing different epitopes, and improving lead prioritization. Surprisingly, our investigation into the correlation between NGS-derived frequencies of CDRs and affinity revealed a lack of association, although this limitation could be moderately mitigated by leveraging NGS clustering, enrichment and/or relative abundance across different regions to enhance lead prioritization. This study highlights NGS benefits, offering insights, recommendations, and the most effective approach to leverage NGS in therapeutic antibody discovery."

Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data."

Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads."
