The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.",

                    "text": "Universal antibody phage display libraries, typically consisting of over ten billion unique sequences, have become a valuable source for discovery of mAbs against any types of targets. According to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library. By using mono-or trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIM technology) as building blocks, 84,85 diversified CDRs can be synthesized in a high-throughput manner, such as array-based oligonucleotide synthesis and Slonomics. 86,87 In the TRIM technology, each amino acid is encoded by a defined codon. Therefore, amino acid distribution at the desired position can be precisely defined. Moreover, because the codon for each amino acid is selected for optimal antibody expression, the functional library size is increased. In the natural antibody repertoire, the diversity of CDRs, except CDRH3, is a collection of defined sequences that exhibit canonical structures. Compared with the traditional column-based DNA synthesis approaches in which one single gene is produced per column, the high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies allow parallel synthesis of a large number of predetermined sequences in the same footprint on a silicon-based chip. 88,89 This enables not only removal of liability motifs that impact developability, but also precise mimic of the",

A key advantage of this system is that monoclonal display can be achieved, which facilitates selection of high affinity clones by avoiding the avidity effect during panning. 63,66 Meanwhile, phage infectivity is maximally retained due to the presence of wild type pIII. One drawback of the system is that wild type pIII is more efficiently assembled in the phage particle, resulting in only a small percentage (<10%) of antibody-displaying phage particles in the population. 74 As . According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library. In a typical phagemid system, variable regions of light and heavy chains, either cloned from a natural immunoglobulin repertoire or designed and synthesized in vitro, are cloned into a phage display vector (phagemid), with one of the chains genetically fused to pIII of phage for display. The library pool is then transformed to E.Coli host cells. By infection with helper phage, which provides all the components for phage production, a phage library is generated. Taking solid-phase panning as an example, the phage library is incubated with immobilized antigen. After washing, nonspecific phages are removed and antigen-specific phages stay with the antigen. The bound phages are then dissociated from the antigen by diverse methods, e.g., low-Ph elution, enzymatic cleavage. Lastly, eluted phages are subjected to propagation in E.Coli host cells. After iterative rounds of panning, antigen-specific clones are enriched. Typically, output phages from middle and late rounds of panning are subjected to sequencing and binding characterization for obtaining both sequence diversity and high affinity, respectively.

                    "text": "Phage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

                    "text": "In general, the improvements of developability properties in the second-generation libraries were achieved by sequencebased optimization. While our knowledge regarding sequence-based prediction of protein liabilities is still limited, many biophysical properties, such as stability, solubility, and expression, are closely related to higher order structure of a protein. Although scaffolds with high stability and expression can be selected for library construction, the overall biophysical properties of antibodies in a phage library are also highly determined by CDR sequence. Therefore, these developability properties were experimentally improved during construction of the third-generation libraries.\n\nIn order to enhance the library solubility and thermostability, a heat shock step, followed by a protein A recovery, was incorporated in the construction of the semisynthetic ALTHEA Gold library. 101 This is based on the observation that heat denaturation selected stable and well-folded antibodies. 153 Validation of the library showed that the overall frequency of hydrophobic residues at diversified CDR positions decreased after heat shock and protein A selection. In contrast, charged residues were positively selected by the filtration process. By panning the library against a diverse panel of antigens, the scFvs selected exhibited high affinity (K D ranges from single-digit nM to sub-nM), solubility (>50 mg/ L), and thermal stability (Tm > 70\u00b0C), which agree with biophysical parameters of therapeutic antibodies. 101,154,155 In another effort to create a semisynthetic phage library with \"drug-like\" properties, a yeast display filtration was applied to select sequences with optimal developability properties required for clinical development, including affinity, aggregation, thermostability, polyspecificity, and expression level. 102 This step leverages the eukaryotic protein quality control systems for selection of correctly behaving proteins for secretion. [156][157][158] In detail, five single-CDR yeast display libraries, in each of which one CDR (except CDRH3) was synthesized from replicated natural diversity, were individually created. The antibody sequences that were displayed correctly and in a high level were selected and subjected to nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) analysis.

The success of mAb is due to their high versatility, high target specificity, excellent clinical safety profile, and efficacy. Antibody discovery, the most upstream stage of the antibody development pipeline, plays a pivotal role in determination of the clinical outcome of an mAb product. Phage display technology, originally developed for peptide directed evolution, has been extensively applied to discovery of fully human antibodies due to its unprecedented advantages. The value of phage display technology has been proven by a number of approved mAbs, including several top-selling mAb drugs, derived from the technology. Since antibody phage display was first established over 30\u2009years ago, phage display platforms have been developed to generate mAbs targeting difficult-to-target antigens and tackle the drawbacks present in in vivo antibody discovery approaches. More recently, the new generation of phage display libraries have been optimized for discovery of mAbs with \u201ddrug-like\u201d properties. This review will summarize the principles of antibody phage display and design of three generations of antibody phage display libraries.\n## Phage display\nthat can be efficiently displayed is limited to 12 amino acids. 71 In a phagemid-based system, antibody-pIII fusion is encoded in a separate plasmid (designated phagemid) and coinfection with a helper phage is required to provide all proteins for phage proliferation. 66,72,73 As a result, each phage particle contains both wild type and antibody-fusion pIII proteins. A key advantage of this system is that monoclonal display can be achieved, which facilitates selection of high affinity clones by avoiding the avidity effect during panning. 63,66 Meanwhile, phage infectivity is maximally retained due to the presence of wild type pIII. One drawback of the system is that wild type pIII is more efficiently assembled in the phage particle, resulting in only a small percentage (<10%) of antibody-displaying phage particles in the population. 74 As . According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library. In a typical phagemid system, variable regions of light and heavy chains, either cloned from a natural immunoglobulin repertoire or designed and synthesized in vitro, are cloned into a phage display vector (phagemid), with one of the chains genetically fused to pIII of phage for display. The library pool is then transformed to E.Coli host cells. By infection with helper phage, which provides all the components for phage production, a phage library is generated. Taking solid-phase panning as an example, the phage library is incubated with immobilized antigen. After washing, nonspecific phages are removed and antigen-specific phages stay with the antigen. The bound phages are then dissociated from the antigen by diverse methods, e.g., low-Ph elution, enzymatic cleavage. Lastly, eluted phages are subjected to propagation in E.Coli host cells. After iterative rounds of panning, antigen-specific clones are enriched. Typically, output phages from middle and late rounds of panning are subjected to sequencing and binding characterization for obtaining both sequence diversity and high affinity, respectively. Alt-text\n\n## Three generations of antibody phage display libraries\nUniversal antibody phage display libraries, typically consisting of over ten billion unique sequences, have become a valuable source for discovery of mAbs against any types of targets. According to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library. By using mono-or trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIM technology) as building blocks, 84,85 diversified CDRs can be synthesized in a high-throughput manner, such as array-based oligonucleotide synthesis and Slonomics. 86,87 In the TRIM technology, each amino acid is encoded by a defined codon. Therefore, amino acid distribution at the desired position can be precisely defined. Moreover, because the codon for each amino acid is selected for optimal antibody expression, the functional library size is increased. In the natural antibody repertoire, the diversity of CDRs, except CDRH3, is a collection of defined sequences that exhibit canonical structures. Compared with the traditional column-based DNA synthesis approaches in which one single gene is produced per column, the high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies allow parallel synthesis of a large number of predetermined sequences in the same footprint on a silicon-based chip. 88,89 This enables not only removal of liability motifs that impact developability, but also precise mimic of the\n\n## Third-generation library\nIn general, the improvements of developability properties in the second-generation libraries were achieved by sequencebased optimization. While our knowledge regarding sequence-based prediction of protein liabilities is still limited, many biophysical properties, such as stability, solubility, and expression, are closely related to higher order structure of a protein. Although scaffolds with high stability and expression can be selected for library construction, the overall biophysical properties of antibodies in a phage library are also highly determined by CDR sequence. Therefore, these developability properties were experimentally improved during construction of the third-generation libraries.\n\nIn order to enhance the library solubility and thermostability, a heat shock step, followed by a protein A recovery, was incorporated in the construction of the semisynthetic ALTHEA Gold library. 101 This is based on the observation that heat denaturation selected stable and well-folded antibodies. 153 Validation of the library showed that the overall frequency of hydrophobic residues at diversified CDR positions decreased after heat shock and protein A selection. In contrast, charged residues were positively selected by the filtration process. By panning the library against a diverse panel of antigens, the scFvs selected exhibited high affinity (K D ranges from single-digit nM to sub-nM), solubility (>50 mg/ L), and thermal stability (Tm > 70\u00b0C), which agree with biophysical parameters of therapeutic antibodies. 101,154,155 In another effort to create a semisynthetic phage library with \"drug-like\" properties, a yeast display filtration was applied to select sequences with optimal developability properties required for clinical development, including affinity, aggregation, thermostability, polyspecificity, and expression level. 102 This step leverages the eukaryotic protein quality control systems for selection of correctly behaving proteins for secretion. [156][157][158] In detail, five single-CDR yeast display libraries, in each of which one CDR (except CDRH3) was synthesized from replicated natural diversity, were individually created. The antibody sequences that were displayed correctly and in a high level were selected and subjected to nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) analysis. CDRH3 sequences, however, were sourced from human natural antibody repertoire\n\n## Conclusions and prospects\nPhage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics.

                    "text": "Four types of antibody libraries can be distinguished with respect to the source of library sequences: Immune, na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries (Figure 2). While the first two are based entirely on naturally occurring sequence diversity, synthetic libraries are diversified according to design. Semi-synthetic libraries combine natural diversity for certain aspects of the library with in silico design. Although the combinatorial aspect is most prominent in semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries, na\u00efve and immune libraries also feature certain combinatorial aspects, e.g. the random pairing of heavy and light chains. For representative examples of different phage display libraries please refer to Table 1. \n\nGeneration of large functional libraries is limited by transformation/transfection efficiency and the occurrence of frame shift mutants leading to non functional proteins. The cloning of large antibody libraries is therefore technically challenging, laborious and time consuming. The principle of in vivo recombination of the light and heavy chain gene of an antibody was first described by the group of Greg Winter as a means to increase library size [65]. A Cre/loxP two vector system was used, with a donor plasmid vector encoding the heavy chain and an acceptor fd phage vector encoding the light chain. Both heavy as well as light chain gene are flanked by loxP sites leading to a site-specific recombination in vivo. By-passing the limitation of transformation efficiency with infection, this system allows the generation of very large libraries. Griffiths and coworkers used this system to generate a phage display library of 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . Sblattero and Bradbury used a modified version where both the heavy and light chain V-genes were located on the same phagemid separated by a loxP site. Starting out with a relatively small initial library with a size of 7 \u00d7 10 7 they were able to generate a library of 3 \u00d7 10 11 in vivo by site-specific recombination [66]. Another important aspect is functional library size, which is limited by the occurrence of deletion mutants caused by frameshifts or stop codons introduced during diversification. Tremendous progress has been made by construction of vector systems comprising a positive selection for protein integrity.",

Neugebauer, Kathrin Ladetzki-Baehs, Kathrin Tissot\n## Abstract\nSince the initial description of phage display technology for the generation of human antibodies, a variety of selection methods has been developed. The most critical parameter for all in vitro-based approaches is the quality of the antibody library. Concurrent evolution of the libraries has allowed display and selection technologies to reveal their full potential. They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design.\n## Design of Combinatorial Antibody Libraries\nFour types of antibody libraries can be distinguished with respect to the source of library sequences: Immune, na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries (Figure 2). While the first two are based entirely on naturally occurring sequence diversity, synthetic libraries are diversified according to design. Semi-synthetic libraries combine natural diversity for certain aspects of the library with in silico design. Although the combinatorial aspect is most prominent in semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries, na\u00efve and immune libraries also feature certain combinatorial aspects, e.g. the random pairing of heavy and light chains. For representative examples of different phage display libraries please refer to Table 1. \n\nGeneration of large functional libraries is limited by transformation/transfection efficiency and the occurrence of frame shift mutants leading to non functional proteins. The cloning of large antibody libraries is therefore technically challenging, laborious and time consuming. The principle of in vivo recombination of the light and heavy chain gene of an antibody was first described by the group of Greg Winter as a means to increase library size [65]. A Cre/loxP two vector system was used, with a donor plasmid vector encoding the heavy chain and an acceptor fd phage vector encoding the light chain. Both heavy as well as light chain gene are flanked by loxP sites leading to a site-specific recombination in vivo. By-passing the limitation of transformation efficiency with infection, this system allows the generation of very large libraries. Griffiths and coworkers used this system to generate a phage display library of 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . Sblattero and Bradbury used a modified version where both the heavy and light chain V-genes were located on the same phagemid separated by a loxP site. Starting out with a relatively small initial library with a size of 7 \u00d7 10 7 they were able to generate a library of 3 \u00d7 10 11 in vivo by site-specific recombination [66]. Another important aspect is functional library size, which is limited by the occurrence of deletion mutants caused by frameshifts or stop codons introduced during diversification. Tremendous progress has been made by construction of vector systems comprising a positive selection for protein integrity.\n\n## Synthetic and Semi-Synthetic Libraries\nThe fundamental difference between immune or na\u00efve libraries and synthetic libraries consists in the origin of the sequences used to build the library. While immune and na\u00efve libraries are amplified from a natural source, synthetic library parts are diversified by design. In synthetic libraries the antibody diversity is designed in silico and then synthesized in a controlled fashion. \n\nThe ratio of naturally-derived and synthetically-designed parts varies in different libraries from semi-to fully synthetic. An advantage of synthetic diversification is that the composition of the CDRs can be exactly defined and controlled. \n\nSynthetic libraries can further be grouped according to the acceptor frameworks used, the origin or design of the sequence diversity within the CDR regions and the method used for building the library. \n\nThe first semi-synthetic libraries used a variety of different framework genes to keep diversity high [55,56,62,79]. In 1992 Hoogenboom and Winter described semi-synthetic scFv-antibody phage display libraries, comprising 49 germline VH sequences and a single V_lambda 3 light chain sequence [79]. Five or eight residues in the CDR-H3 were randomized in a PCR-based approach to generate libraries with a size of 1 \u00d7 10 7 . Subsequent libraries were based on the same set of acceptor VH frameworks, with the addition of 26 kappa and 21 lambda sequences [62]. Length variability was introduced in the CDR3s and diversity generated through randomization of 4-12 residues in CDR-H3, 1-3 residues in kappa CDR-L3 and 0-5 residues in lambda CDR-L3. In parallel, library size increased over three orders of magnitude up to 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . \n\nIn a similar approach, de Kruif and collaborators used all 49 human germline VH genes and seven different light chain genes (4 V_kappa, 3 V_lambda) with CDR-H3 length variability between 6-15 residues to construct a library of the size of 3.6 \u00d7 10 8 . \n\nThe shorter CDR-H3s of six amino acid length were fully randomized, whereas for the longer CDR-H3s the design included a stretch of fully randomized amino acid residues flanked by regions of lower diversity resembling human antibody sequences [56].\n\n## Conclusions\nOver the past 15 years the generation of therapeutic antibodies from combinatorial antibody libraries has been established as a valid alternative to conventional immunization. To isolate candidates from such libraries the antibodies or antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of cells, phages, ribosomes or within the cell. Among those display methods, phage display has the longest history and it is among the technologies most commonly used today. While the choice of the antibody format can be limited by the display method, e.g., to the scFv or the Fab in the case of phage display, library design is in principle independent, as long as sufficient expression properties in the respective host system are ensured. \n\nCombinatorial antibody libraries differ in design, origin of sequence diversity and method of generation.

                    "text": "Once display of a parent protein has been demonstrated, it is possible to build display libraries of 10 6 -10 11 variants from which variants having a desired binding property can be selected. In contrast, other screening methods such as chemical library or cell based screening allow testing of hundreds or thousands of synthetic compounds, or tens of thousands of plated colonies. In fact, 10 10 variants in a phage display library is actually a small part of the available theoretical sequence space. That is, the first set of binders to an antigen of interest can be subsequently diversified, retaining the sequence features that initially caused binding. This iterative variegation was used successfully to create high-affinity protease inhibitors of human plasmin, plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and it has become a common strategy in affinity maturation of drug candidates identified by phage display. 4,5 hage display was first described in 1985 and used to display short peptide fragments, 6 and the first patent was filed in 1991 (US5223409). 7 Since then, phage display has proven to be a reliable method for the generation of peptides with potential therapeutic or diagnostic utility. 8 Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv) was reported in 1990, along with selective recovery of the phage on the basis of antigen binding. 9 It has since become a major discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 10 More recently described antibody libraries have displayed Fab fragments on the phage protein, which can be readily reformatted to full-length IgG antibodies, usually without loss of binding function. 11,12 ources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest.",

Alternatively, single large na\u00efve, 13 synthetic, 14,15 or semi-synthetic libraries (where synthetic diversity is combined with natural diversity) 12 have been shown to be capable of producing high affinity antibodies (K d < 10nM) to a wide range of structurally diverse antigens. The use of such libraries therefore eliminates the need for a specific library for a specific antigen and circumvents issues with immunological tolerance found with mouse immunization approaches. \n\nA critical feature of phage display is the ability to deplete libraries of binders to epitopes that are not of interest. Use of compounds (such as murine antibodies or non-specific enzyme inhibitors) that mask desirable binding sites on the target can be used to deplete libraries and thereby enrich for candidates likely to have desired biological activity (Fig. 2). For example, in the development of an active-site inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) the phage display library was first depleted by selecting with MMP-14 bound to its natural, active site inhibitor. 16 This depletion step eliminates the majority of antibodies that bind at sites other than the active site. Subsequent selection with active MMP-14 was then used to identify a highly specific candidate antibody that acted as a competitive inhibitor to the target site of interest. 3 Selection strategies can also be designed to remove candidates with vulnerability toward challenges such as proteolytic digestion or resistance to denaturation. 17 Moreover, the initial protein scaffold itself can be used to steer toward biological activity. For example, Kunitz domains are highly likely to bind the active site of serine proteases and have been used as a successful starting point to create a variety of specific protease inhibitors. 18 ][21] Another distinct advantage of using in vitro methods, such as phage display, for drug discovery is the ability to select for candidates that bind to both human and non-human targets. 3 Having a candidate that binds the mouse, rat or monkey orthologs of a human target simplifies preclinical tests of efficacy and toxicity, and can shorten development timelines.",

Ladner\n## Abstract\nPhage display, one of today\u2019s fundamental drug discovery technologies, allows identification of a broad range of biological drugs, including peptides, antibodies and other proteins, with the ability to tailor critical characteristics such as potency, specificity and cross-species binding. Further, unlike in vivo technologies, generating phage display-derived antibodies is not restricted by immunological tolerance. Although more than 20 phage display-derived antibody and peptides are currently in late-stage clinical trials or approved, there is little literature addressing the specific challenges and successes in the clinical development of phage-derived drugs. This review uses case studies, from candidate identification through clinical development, to illustrate the utility of phage display as a drug discovery tool, and offers a perspective for future developments of phage display technology.\n## Introduction to Phage Display\nOnce display of a parent protein has been demonstrated, it is possible to build display libraries of 10 6 -10 11 variants from which variants having a desired binding property can be selected. In contrast, other screening methods such as chemical library or cell based screening allow testing of hundreds or thousands of synthetic compounds, or tens of thousands of plated colonies. In fact, 10 10 variants in a phage display library is actually a small part of the available theoretical sequence space. That is, the first set of binders to an antigen of interest can be subsequently diversified, retaining the sequence features that initially caused binding. This iterative variegation was used successfully to create high-affinity protease inhibitors of human plasmin, plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and it has become a common strategy in affinity maturation of drug candidates identified by phage display. 4,5 hage display was first described in 1985 and used to display short peptide fragments, 6 and the first patent was filed in 1991 (US5223409). 7 Since then, phage display has proven to be a reliable method for the generation of peptides with potential therapeutic or diagnostic utility. 8 Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv) was reported in 1990, along with selective recovery of the phage on the basis of antigen binding. 9 It has since become a major discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 10 More recently described antibody libraries have displayed Fab fragments on the phage protein, which can be readily reformatted to full-length IgG antibodies, usually without loss of binding function. 11,12 ources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest.\n...\nThis approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest. Alternatively, single large na\u00efve, 13 synthetic, 14,15 or semi-synthetic libraries (where synthetic diversity is combined with natural diversity) 12 have been shown to be capable of producing high affinity antibodies (K d < 10nM) to a wide range of structurally diverse antigens. The use of such libraries therefore eliminates the need for a specific library for a specific antigen and circumvents issues with immunological tolerance found with mouse immunization approaches. \n\nA critical feature of phage display is the ability to deplete libraries of binders to epitopes that are not of interest. Use of compounds (such as murine antibodies or non-specific enzyme inhibitors) that mask desirable binding sites on the target can be used to deplete libraries and thereby enrich for candidates likely to have desired biological activity (Fig. 2). For example, in the development of an active-site inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) the phage display library was first depleted by selecting with MMP-14 bound to its natural, active site inhibitor. 16 This depletion step eliminates the majority of antibodies that bind at sites other than the active site. Subsequent selection with active MMP-14 was then used to identify a highly specific candidate antibody that acted as a competitive inhibitor to the target site of interest. 3 Selection strategies can also be designed to remove candidates with vulnerability toward challenges such as proteolytic digestion or resistance to denaturation. 17 Moreover, the initial protein scaffold itself can be used to steer toward biological activity. For example, Kunitz domains are highly likely to bind the active site of serine proteases and have been used as a successful starting point to create a variety of specific protease inhibitors. 18 ][21] Another distinct advantage of using in vitro methods, such as phage display, for drug discovery is the ability to select for candidates that bind to both human and non-human targets. 3 Having a candidate that binds the mouse, rat or monkey orthologs of a human target simplifies preclinical tests of efficacy and toxicity, and can shorten development timelines.",

One remarkable feature of nanobodies is their compact size, comprising only the variable domain without the additional heavy or light chains. This simplicity grants nanobodies several advantages, including enhanced tissue penetration, increased stability, and the ability to recognize cryptic epitopes that might be challenging for larger antibodies.

Since then, numerous phage-derived antibodies have been successfully developed and advanced into clinical studies, resulting in the approval of more than a dozen therapeutic antibodies. These antibodies have demonstrated efficacy across a spectrum of medical conditions, ranging from autoimmune diseases to various cancers. In this article, we provide an in-depth review of the development of phage display libraries as powerful platforms for therapeutic antibody discovery, elucidating the intricate procedures involved in antibody development. Additionally, we conduct a review of the current ntibody drugs for cancer treatment that have been developed using the phage display platform. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges inherent in this technology, offering insights into potential solutions to enhance crucial steps and facilitate more efficient drug discovery in the field of phage display technology.\n## Library Construction\nThe journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.\n\n## Categories of Phage Display Libraries for Antibody Development\nRenowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27]. One remarkable feature of nanobodies is their compact size, comprising only the variable domain without the additional heavy or light chains. This simplicity grants nanobodies several advantages, including enhanced tissue penetration, increased stability, and the ability to recognize cryptic epitopes that might be challenging for larger antibodies. The absence of a light chain also simplifies production and engineering processes. The selection process from nanobody libraries often involves immunizing animals with the target antigen of interest, followed by the generation of the library and subsequent panning against the antigen. Additionally, synthetic or na\u00efve nanobody libraries can be created without prior immunization, providing a valuable resource for discovering binders against a wide range of targets [28]. \n\nIn addition, chimeric phage display libraries are a hybrid class of libraries that incorporate genetic material from multiple sources, combining elements to enhance the diversity and functionality of displayed peptides or proteins. The construction of chimeric libraries involves the fusion of genetic sequences derived from different antibody fragments or protein domains, resulting in a mosaic-like collection of variants presented on the surface of bacteriophages [29]. These libraries aim to harness the strengths of different antibody formats or functional domains to create molecules with optimized properties. One common strategy for constructing chimeric libraries is the fusion of variable regions from human antibodies with constant regions from non-human sources, such as mice. This chimerization process seeks to retain the specificity and affinity of human antibodies while benefiting from the stability and expression advantages offered by non-human constant regions. Chimeric libraries can also be generated by combining variable domains from different antibodies, allowing for the exploration of diverse binding specificities within a single library [30]. \n\nIn another way, phage display antibody libraries can be classified into four distinct types based on the origin of their sequences: naive, immune, semi-synthetic, and synthetic libraries [31,32]. Naive libraries, sourced from natural entities such as primary B-cells of non-immunized donors, harness naturally rearranged variable region genes. With extensive repertoires reaching up to 10 11 members, naive libraries have the capacity to generate antibodies targeting a diverse array of antigens.",

The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era.

In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage. The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms.\n## Phage Display Antibody Libraries\nPhage display libraries can be constructed using antibody variable (v) genes isolated from IgM mRNA of non-immunised human donor B cells derived from diverse lymphoid sources such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), spleen cells, tonsils, bone marrow or from nonimmunised animal B cells (na\u00efve antibody libraries).

Indeed, antibodies obtained from this library had a proportion of T-cell epitopes no higher than that of naturally occurring antibodies. An antibody against ICAM-1 was isolated from this library and shown to have potent anti-myeloma activity in vivo (30). \n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation. Hoet et al. at Dyax Corp reported the isolation of very high-affinity antibodies through synthetic diversity introduced into the key antigen-contact sites of CDR1 and CDR2 within the heavy chain in combination with naturally occurring diversity in the heavy chain CDR3 and light chains from donors with autoimmune diseases (31). Their human antibody phage display libraries have produced multiple drug candidates currently in different phases of clinical development.",

In many instances, to simplify construction, only the CDR3 region was fully synthetic. Subsequently, libraries with fully synthetic variable sequences were introduced, with the FR based on consensus sequences from natural antibodies but optimized for high expression on phage in Escherichia coli to reduce the effect of variable expression of the human framework sequences on selection. The first fully synthetic Human Combinatorial Antibody Libraries (HuCAL) generated to produce therapeutic antibodies was reported by Morphosys in 2000 with their first version of the HuCAL (16). Several versions of the HuCAL has since been constructed that incorporate additional features such as improved phage elution by disulphide bond cleavage, selection for in-frame clones, additional CDR3 loop length and diversity and optimization for expression in mammalian cell culture through removal of unwanted potential post-translational modification sites (25,26). These modifications have resulted in an increase in the number of antibodies isolated per target antigen. There are several antibodies generated from the Morphosys libraries currently in various stages of clinical development; a recent example being the potent anti-cancer activity of OMP-18R5, with activity in multiple preclinical human tumour models (27). This antibody targeting the Wnt pathway was isolated from the HuCAL GOLD library and is currently in Phase 1 clinical testing. \n\nWhile synthetic libraries have allowed the development of human antibodies with reduced immunogenicity relative to humanized animal antibodies against self-antigens, the CDRs of these libraries can also be immunogenic as often the sequences are not naturally present in the human antibody repertoire (28). With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.",

An additional advantage of these libraries is that design features can be incorporated to allow facile affinity maturation, such as CDRs flanked by restriction sites for easy replacement or appropriate consensus primers for targeting of specific CDRs for directed mutagenesis (16). Several fully human synthetic library-derived mAbs have been approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration or completed clinical trials. The first of these was adalimumab, an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody developed by Cambridge Antibody Technologies for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis and Crohn's disease (17,18). Subsequently, other antibodies were developed for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease such as necitumumab (non-small cell lung cancer), ramucirumab (gastrointestinal cancers) and belimumab (systemic lupus erythematosus) (12,19,20). Many others are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years (21,22).

An additional advantage of these libraries is that design features can be incorporated to allow facile affinity maturation, such as CDRs flanked by restriction sites for easy replacement or appropriate consensus primers for targeting of specific CDRs for directed mutagenesis (16). Several fully human synthetic library-derived mAbs have been approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration or completed clinical trials. The first of these was adalimumab, an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody developed by Cambridge Antibody Technologies for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis and Crohn's disease (17,18). Subsequently, other antibodies were developed for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease such as necitumumab (non-small cell lung cancer), ramucirumab (gastrointestinal cancers) and belimumab (systemic lupus erythematosus) (12,19,20). Many others are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years (21,22). As mAbs gain popularity as a form of alternative drug therapy, the use of phage displayed antibody libraries has also gained a reputation as the premier technology for antibody discovery. \n\nSemi-synthetic libraries, which were the first to be made, typically consist of FRs sourced from naturally occurring antibodies and CDR regions synthesized from degenerate oligonucleotides (23,24).\n...\nSemi-synthetic libraries, which were the first to be made, typically consist of FRs sourced from naturally occurring antibodies and CDR regions synthesized from degenerate oligonucleotides (23,24). In many instances, to simplify construction, only the CDR3 region was fully synthetic. Subsequently, libraries with fully synthetic variable sequences were introduced, with the FR based on consensus sequences from natural antibodies but optimized for high expression on phage in Escherichia coli to reduce the effect of variable expression of the human framework sequences on selection. The first fully synthetic Human Combinatorial Antibody Libraries (HuCAL) generated to produce therapeutic antibodies was reported by Morphosys in 2000 with their first version of the HuCAL (16). Several versions of the HuCAL has since been constructed that incorporate additional features such as improved phage elution by disulphide bond cleavage, selection for in-frame clones, additional CDR3 loop length and diversity and optimization for expression in mammalian cell culture through removal of unwanted potential post-translational modification sites (25,26). These modifications have resulted in an increase in the number of antibodies isolated per target antigen. There are several antibodies generated from the Morphosys libraries currently in various stages of clinical development; a recent example being the potent anti-cancer activity of OMP-18R5, with activity in multiple preclinical human tumour models (27). This antibody targeting the Wnt pathway was isolated from the HuCAL GOLD library and is currently in Phase 1 clinical testing. \n\nWhile synthetic libraries have allowed the development of human antibodies with reduced immunogenicity relative to humanized animal antibodies against self-antigens, the CDRs of these libraries can also be immunogenic as often the sequences are not naturally present in the human antibody repertoire (28). With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.\n...\nWhile allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic. Indeed, antibodies obtained from this library had a proportion of T-cell epitopes no higher than that of naturally occurring antibodies. An antibody against ICAM-1 was isolated from this library and shown to have potent anti-myeloma activity in vivo (30). \n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation. Hoet et al. at Dyax Corp reported the isolation of very high-affinity antibodies through synthetic diversity introduced into the key antigen-contact sites of CDR1 and CDR2 within the heavy chain in combination with naturally occurring diversity in the heavy chain CDR3 and light chains from donors with autoimmune diseases (31). Their human antibody phage display libraries have produced multiple drug candidates currently in different phases of clinical development.",

Generally, the greater the antibody library diversity, the greater the probability of selecting a diverse array of high affinity leads. According to this paradigm, the primary means of elevating library diversity has been\u00a0by increasing the number of donors. In the present study we explored the possibility\u00a0of creating an in vitro antibody library from a single healthy individual, showing that the number of lymphocytes, rather than\u00a0the number of donors, is the key\u00a0criterion in the production of a diverse and functional antibody library. We describe the construction of a high-quality phage display library comprising\u00a05\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9 human antibodies by applying an efficient B cell extraction protocol from a single donor and a targeted V-gene amplification strategy favoring\u00a0specific antibody families for their improved developability profiles. Each step of the library generation process\u00a0was followed and validated by next generation sequencing to\u00a0monitor the library quality and diversity. The functionality of the library was tested using several therapeutically relevant targets for which a vast number of different antibodies with desired biophysical properties were obtained. Here, the authors construct and validate an in vitro antibody library from a single, healthy donor. They demonstrate the functionality of the library using several therapeutically relevant targets and were able to obtain many different antibodies with the desired biophysical properties.",

Effective development of therapeutic antibodies demands high-quality molecules to meet strict manufacturing requirements and success in clinical applications. The first step in antibody discovery is the identification of potential candidate binding targets of interest, with two main methods used: hybridoma generation (or more recently single-cell cloning methods) from the immunization of normal or transgenic animals, and display methods based on naive or immune libraries. The source of diversity for libraries from which antibodies are selected has taken many formats: immune repertoires, generated from immunized animals or humans seropositive for a target; natural naive, derived from the B lymphocytes of nonimmunized donors [1][2][3] ; synthetic, in which diversity is derived from oligonucleotides [4][5][6][7][8][9] ; semi-synthetic, combining synthetic and natural diversity 10 ; and PCR-based recombinatorial approaches in which natural CDR diversity is shuffled within a fixed scaffold 11,12 . \n\nSpecific binders are selected from libraries displayed using platforms such as phage/phagemid 1,13,14 , yeast 15,16 , ribosome 17,18 , and mammalian display [19][20][21] , with phage and yeast display being the most commonly used. These methods couple phenotype to genotype: the gene encoding the displayed antibody is coupled to the antibody itself, allowing the cloning of antibody genes on the basis of the properties (e.g., binding activity) of the encoded antibodies. Once selected, the affinity or specificity of an antibody can be further improved by applying the same display methods to derivative libraries. \n\nThe key feature of any compound library, including antibody libraries, is diversity. In the case of antibody libraries, this is often measured by counting the number of clones obtained after library transformation. However, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 .",

                    "text": "However, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 . Diversity correlates with library functionality: the probability of discovering an antibody in the library with desired activity (e.g., affinity, functional activity, or therapeutic efficacy). In the case of antibody libraries, other desirable key features are \"developability properties\": stability and resistance to aggregation in solution, thermodynamic stability, and low self-interaction, among others. Therefore, scientists strive to make antibody libraries as large as possible by performing numerous transformations or, less commonly, applying sitespecific recombination approaches 3,4,24 . However, unless the underlying genetic diversity is sufficiently large, generating more transformants will not necessarily increase library functionality. This is less of a problem for synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries, in which the theoretical diversity far exceeds the number of transformants that can be routinely obtained. For example, the theoretical diversity of the HuCAL Gold library 8 was estimated to be 10 60 , but the number of transformants, 10 10 , was the limiting factor. Although the assessment of genetic diversity is clearly an improvement over counting colonies, functional diversity is a more valuable measure, particularly in the case of synthetic libraries in which degenerate oligonucleotides may encode poorly folding, or polyreactive, antibodies, resulting in a larger chemical space that does not necessarily directly correlates with protein functionality. \n\nFor natural naive libraries, the general paradigm has been to increase the natural source of B-cell diversity by increasing the number of donors 23,25,26 . The question remains as to whether increasing the number of donors actually leads to improved antibody diversity and library functionality. \n\nIn recent papers examining library diversity with nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), estimated genetic diversity was far lower than anticipated 22,23,26,27 . This may be a consequence of cloning or PCR inefficiencies, inherently restricted underlying diversity (e.g., insufficient numbers of B cells or libraries skewed by excesses of memory or plasma cells), or problems with harvesting the natural diversity, by failing to collect and reproduce the entirety of the diversity present in the starting material.",

Erasmus, S. D\u2019Angelo, F. Ferrara, L. Naranjo, Andre A R Teixeira, Rebecca A Buonpane, Shaun Stewart, H. Nastri, A. Bradbury\n## Abstract\nAntibody complementarity determining region diversity has been considered to be the most important\u00a0metric for the production of a functional antibody library. Generally, the greater the antibody library diversity, the greater the probability of selecting a diverse array of high affinity leads. According to this paradigm, the primary means of elevating library diversity has been\u00a0by increasing the number of donors. In the present study we explored the possibility\u00a0of creating an in vitro antibody library from a single healthy individual, showing that the number of lymphocytes, rather than\u00a0the number of donors, is the key\u00a0criterion in the production of a diverse and functional antibody library. We describe the construction of a high-quality phage display library comprising\u00a05\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9 human antibodies by applying an efficient B cell extraction protocol from a single donor and a targeted V-gene amplification strategy favoring\u00a0specific antibody families for their improved developability profiles. Each step of the library generation process\u00a0was followed and validated by next generation sequencing to\u00a0monitor the library quality and diversity. The functionality of the library was tested using several therapeutically relevant targets for which a vast number of different antibodies with desired biophysical properties were obtained. Here, the authors construct and validate an in vitro antibody library from a single, healthy donor. They demonstrate the functionality of the library using several therapeutically relevant targets and were able to obtain many different antibodies with the desired biophysical properties.\n## M\nonoclonal antibodies are now the most successful class of therapeutics, representing seven of the top ten bestselling pharmaceuticals. Effective development of therapeutic antibodies demands high-quality molecules to meet strict manufacturing requirements and success in clinical applications. The first step in antibody discovery is the identification of potential candidate binding targets of interest, with two main methods used: hybridoma generation (or more recently single-cell cloning methods) from the immunization of normal or transgenic animals, and display methods based on naive or immune libraries. The source of diversity for libraries from which antibodies are selected has taken many formats: immune repertoires, generated from immunized animals or humans seropositive for a target; natural naive, derived from the B lymphocytes of nonimmunized donors [1][2][3] ; synthetic, in which diversity is derived from oligonucleotides [4][5][6][7][8][9] ; semi-synthetic, combining synthetic and natural diversity 10 ; and PCR-based recombinatorial approaches in which natural CDR diversity is shuffled within a fixed scaffold 11,12 . \n\nSpecific binders are selected from libraries displayed using platforms such as phage/phagemid 1,13,14 , yeast 15,16 , ribosome 17,18 , and mammalian display [19][20][21] , with phage and yeast display being the most commonly used. These methods couple phenotype to genotype: the gene encoding the displayed antibody is coupled to the antibody itself, allowing the cloning of antibody genes on the basis of the properties (e.g., binding activity) of the encoded antibodies. Once selected, the affinity or specificity of an antibody can be further improved by applying the same display methods to derivative libraries. \n\nThe key feature of any compound library, including antibody libraries, is diversity. In the case of antibody libraries, this is often measured by counting the number of clones obtained after library transformation. However, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 .\n...\nHowever, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 . Diversity correlates with library functionality: the probability of discovering an antibody in the library with desired activity (e.g., affinity, functional activity, or therapeutic efficacy). In the case of antibody libraries, other desirable key features are \"developability properties\": stability and resistance to aggregation in solution, thermodynamic stability, and low self-interaction, among others. Therefore, scientists strive to make antibody libraries as large as possible by performing numerous transformations or, less commonly, applying sitespecific recombination approaches 3,4,24 . However, unless the underlying genetic diversity is sufficiently large, generating more transformants will not necessarily increase library functionality. This is less of a problem for synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries, in which the theoretical diversity far exceeds the number of transformants that can be routinely obtained. For example, the theoretical diversity of the HuCAL Gold library 8 was estimated to be 10 60 , but the number of transformants, 10 10 , was the limiting factor. Although the assessment of genetic diversity is clearly an improvement over counting colonies, functional diversity is a more valuable measure, particularly in the case of synthetic libraries in which degenerate oligonucleotides may encode poorly folding, or polyreactive, antibodies, resulting in a larger chemical space that does not necessarily directly correlates with protein functionality. \n\nFor natural naive libraries, the general paradigm has been to increase the natural source of B-cell diversity by increasing the number of donors 23,25,26 . The question remains as to whether increasing the number of donors actually leads to improved antibody diversity and library functionality. \n\nIn recent papers examining library diversity with nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), estimated genetic diversity was far lower than anticipated 22,23,26,27 . This may be a consequence of cloning or PCR inefficiencies, inherently restricted underlying diversity (e.g., insufficient numbers of B cells or libraries skewed by excesses of memory or plasma cells), or problems with harvesting the natural diversity, by failing to collect and reproduce the entirety of the diversity present in the starting material.",

                    "text": "For instance, most mAbs produced via hybridoma technology are of murine origin and may induce human antimouse antibody responses in clinical settings [14]. To mitigate immunogenicity, antibodies from non-human species undergo a humanization process, either through chimerization or by grafting complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) on scaffolds from human Ig. However, these modifications can compromise the antibodies' binding affinity or stability, potentially reducing their therapeutic efficacy [15,16]. Consequently, screening antibodies from a human library is deemed the most effective approach for developing clinically applicable antibodies [17]. \n\nAmong various antibody libraries, such as synthetic, semi-synthetic, na\u00efve, immune libraries, and predefined CDR libraries tailored to specific requirements, the immune library offers a distinct advantage due to its repertoire specifically elicited against the target antigen [17][18][19][20][21]. Affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation and repeated exposure via immunization or natural infection enhances the specificity and efficacy of the antibodies. Antibodies sourced from immune libraries exhibit superior binding affinities compared to those from synthetic or na\u00efve libraries [17,22]. The human immune library, boasting its inherent diversity and eliminating the need for humanization, is an ideal source for library construction. Nonetheless, constructing a human immune library presents Methods Protoc. 2024, 7, 13 3 of 31 challenges, such as ethical considerations and the impracticality of deliberate immunization with the target antigen. Hence, the creation of a human immune scFv library typically relies on donated samples from individuals naturally exposed to the antigen or infected with the target pathogen [17,18,20,23]. \n\nThe innovative development of phage display by George P. Smith has revolutionized the field, offering an efficient technique for generating antibodies against specific antigens [24]. Phage display screening, or affinity selection, is characterized by its rapidity, the ability to screen vast libraries, superior efficiency compared to conventional hybridoma methods, and cost-effectiveness [25][26][27]. This method allows for the display of diverse scFv repertoires on the surface of filamentous phages, facilitating their binding to the desired antigen.",

The protocol utilizes 348 primer combinations spanning the entire human antibody repertoire to minimize sequence bias and maintain library diversity during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for scFv generation, resulting in a library size greater than 1 \u00d7 108. Furthermore, we describe a high-throughput phage display screening protocol using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate more than 1200 scFv candidates. The generation of a highly diverse scFv library, coupled with the implementation of a phage display screening methodology, is expected to provide a valuable resource for researchers in pursuit of scFvs with high affinity for target antigens, thus advancing both research and clinical endeavors.\n## Introduction\nFor instance, most mAbs produced via hybridoma technology are of murine origin and may induce human antimouse antibody responses in clinical settings [14]. To mitigate immunogenicity, antibodies from non-human species undergo a humanization process, either through chimerization or by grafting complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) on scaffolds from human Ig. However, these modifications can compromise the antibodies' binding affinity or stability, potentially reducing their therapeutic efficacy [15,16]. Consequently, screening antibodies from a human library is deemed the most effective approach for developing clinically applicable antibodies [17]. \n\nAmong various antibody libraries, such as synthetic, semi-synthetic, na\u00efve, immune libraries, and predefined CDR libraries tailored to specific requirements, the immune library offers a distinct advantage due to its repertoire specifically elicited against the target antigen [17][18][19][20][21]. Affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation and repeated exposure via immunization or natural infection enhances the specificity and efficacy of the antibodies. Antibodies sourced from immune libraries exhibit superior binding affinities compared to those from synthetic or na\u00efve libraries [17,22]. The human immune library, boasting its inherent diversity and eliminating the need for humanization, is an ideal source for library construction. Nonetheless, constructing a human immune library presents Methods Protoc. 2024, 7, 13 3 of 31 challenges, such as ethical considerations and the impracticality of deliberate immunization with the target antigen. Hence, the creation of a human immune scFv library typically relies on donated samples from individuals naturally exposed to the antigen or infected with the target pathogen [17,18,20,23]. \n\nThe innovative development of phage display by George P. Smith has revolutionized the field, offering an efficient technique for generating antibodies against specific antigens [24]. Phage display screening, or affinity selection, is characterized by its rapidity, the ability to screen vast libraries, superior efficiency compared to conventional hybridoma methods, and cost-effectiveness [25][26][27]. This method allows for the display of diverse scFv repertoires on the surface of filamentous phages, facilitating their binding to the desired antigen.",

However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. 32 Most of these libraries are produced from mouse, 33\u221237 but also other animals, such as chicken, 38,39 rabbit, 32,40 sheep, 41 monkey, 42 camel, 43 and shark, 44 have been used. Additionally, immunized human libraries have been made using blood from patients naturally infected with viruses or parasites. 5,45 n the other hand, nai \u0308ve antibody libraries can be constructed completely in vitro resulting in nonimmunized, 46 synthetic, 47 or semisynthetic libraries. 48 The use of synthetic repertoires bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences. 49 Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). 9 Synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce diversity into the CDRs.",

Many environmentally or pharmacologically interesting target analytes might not have naturally appropriate binding partners for biosensor development, but phage display can facilitate the production of novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, making the technology a valuable tool in the quest of new recognition elements for biosensor development.\n## ACS Omega\nAlthough the first use of phage display focused on peptides, antibody libraries have been arguably the most successful use of this technology and have led to the discovery of antibodies with affinities comparable to those obtained by hybridoma technology. 9,27 In fact, alongside with the development of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology 28 and the isolation and cloning of antibody genes to enable expression of antibody fragments in bacteria, 29,30 the generation of antibody libraries by phage display can be considered as one of the groundbreaking methods for the antibody discovery. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed from natural sources by isolating the B cells of a source animal that has been immunized with the target antigen and using the isolated antibody genes to create the antibody library. 31 These kind of libraries have a strong bias toward the antigen, and even a modest-sized library can be sufficient to isolate specific binders. However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. 32 Most of these libraries are produced from mouse, 33\u221237 but also other animals, such as chicken, 38,39 rabbit, 32,40 sheep, 41 monkey, 42 camel, 43 and shark, 44 have been used. Additionally, immunized human libraries have been made using blood from patients naturally infected with viruses or parasites. 5,45 n the other hand, nai \u0308ve antibody libraries can be constructed completely in vitro resulting in nonimmunized, 46 synthetic, 47 or semisynthetic libraries. 48 The use of synthetic repertoires bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences. 49 Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). 9 Synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce diversity into the CDRs.",

Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38].

Such plasticity can be exploited to generate human antibody libraries featuring hallmarks of these diverse repertoires. In this study, the focus was to capture CDRH3 sequences, as this region generally accounts for most of the interaction energy with antigen. Sequences from human as well as non-human sources were successfully integrated into human antibody libraries. Next generation sequencing of these libraries proved that the CDRH3 lengths and amino acid composition corresponded to the species of origin. Specific CDRH3 sequences, biased towards the recognition of a model antigen either by immunizing mice or by selecting with phage display, were then integrated into another set of libraries. From these antigen biased libraries, highly potent antibodies were more frequently isolated, indicating that the characteristics of an immune repertoire is transferrable via CDRH3 sequences into a human antibody library. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the properties of naturally or experimentally biased repertoires can be effectively harnessed for the generation of targeted human antibody libraries, substantially increasing the probability of isolating antibodies suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

                    "text": "A key characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its capacity to generate useful antibodies directed against invading pathogens. For this, the antibody repertoire expressed by B cells within an organism constantly evolves in response to infection. Phage, yeast, ribosome or bacterial display methodologies [1], [2] are employed extensively for the generation of antibodies to be used for research and therapeutic applications [3], [4]. This approach aims at recapitulating the process of appropriate antibody creation by the immune system, via in vitro selection of target-specific antibodies starting from a large repository of immunoglobulin genes [5]. \n\nStrategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity [6], [7], [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires [9], [10], [11], [12]. A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity [11], [13], [14], [15]. One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16].",

Ravn, V. Buatois, F. Gueneau, S\u00e9bastien Calloud, M. Kosco-Vilbois, N. Fischer\n## Abstract\nAntibody repertoires are characterized by diversity as they vary not only amongst individuals and post antigen exposure but also differ significantly between vertebrate species. Such plasticity can be exploited to generate human antibody libraries featuring hallmarks of these diverse repertoires. In this study, the focus was to capture CDRH3 sequences, as this region generally accounts for most of the interaction energy with antigen. Sequences from human as well as non-human sources were successfully integrated into human antibody libraries. Next generation sequencing of these libraries proved that the CDRH3 lengths and amino acid composition corresponded to the species of origin. Specific CDRH3 sequences, biased towards the recognition of a model antigen either by immunizing mice or by selecting with phage display, were then integrated into another set of libraries. From these antigen biased libraries, highly potent antibodies were more frequently isolated, indicating that the characteristics of an immune repertoire is transferrable via CDRH3 sequences into a human antibody library. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the properties of naturally or experimentally biased repertoires can be effectively harnessed for the generation of targeted human antibody libraries, substantially increasing the probability of isolating antibodies suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.\n## Introduction\nA key characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its capacity to generate useful antibodies directed against invading pathogens. For this, the antibody repertoire expressed by B cells within an organism constantly evolves in response to infection. Phage, yeast, ribosome or bacterial display methodologies [1], [2] are employed extensively for the generation of antibodies to be used for research and therapeutic applications [3], [4]. This approach aims at recapitulating the process of appropriate antibody creation by the immune system, via in vitro selection of target-specific antibodies starting from a large repository of immunoglobulin genes [5]. \n\nStrategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity [6], [7], [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires [9], [10], [11], [12]. A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity [11], [13], [14], [15]. One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16].",

The advantage of synthetic antibody libraries includes the possibility of exerting fine control over factors like framework sequences, amino acid and codon usage, and CDR diversity. However, random combinatorial synthesis of oligonucleotides for CDR sequence diversity also produces many clones with unnatural sequences and/or undesirable modification motifs. To alleviate these issues, we designed and constructed a novel semi-synthetic human scFv library with non-combinatorial, pre-designed CDR diversity and a single native human framework each for heavy, kappa, and lambda chain variable domains. Next-generation sequencing analysis indicated that the library consists of antibody clones with highly nature-like CDR sequences and the occurrence of the post-translational modification motifs is minimized. Multiple unique clones with nanomolar affinity could be isolated from the library against a number of target antigens, validating the library design strategy. The results demonstrate that it is possible to construct a functional antibody library using low, non-combinatorial synthetic CDR diversity, and provides a new strategy for the design of antibody libraries suitable for demanding applications.",

The size and quality of the antibody library is a major determinant of the success of in vitro antibody generation, and many different strategies have been employed to design and construct large, highly functional antibody libraries [1]. While the size of an antibody library is mostly determined by the transformation efficiency of bacteria or yeast, multiple different factors can influence the functionality of a library and thus need to be considered in the library design. One important factor in library design is the source and nature of the sequence diversity, which can originate from natural (animal B-cells), synthetic, or semi-synthetic sources. \n\nAntibody libraries from natural sources consist of antibody clones with variable regions that are the end product of V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation of germline immunoglobulin genes, all of which are presumably optimized through the evolutionary history of adaptive immunity. Antibodies isolated from a natural antibody library are thus generally considered more nature-like than those from a synthetic antibody library, whose diversity typically is generated by random combinatorial events. On the other hand, the greater heterogeneity of the framework regions among the clones of natural antibody libraries may result in more uneven propagation of the clones during the amplification phase of biopanning. Also, somatic hypermutations, especially in the framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that can elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response when the antibody is used as a therapeutic agent. \n\nSynthetic antibody libraries usually have one or a small number of framework sequences, upon which artificially designed and synthesized CDR sequences are grafted. The CDR diversity is mostly generated by concatenating random nucleotides [2][3][4] or trinucleotide units [5][6][7]. Various CDR design strategies have been employed to emulate natural CDRs. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences to the library.",

Bai, Jihye Kim, Seungmin Kang, Wankyu Kim, H. Shim\n## Abstract\nThe present work describes the construction and validation of a human scFv library with a novel design approach to synthetic complementarity determining region (CDR) diversification. The advantage of synthetic antibody libraries includes the possibility of exerting fine control over factors like framework sequences, amino acid and codon usage, and CDR diversity. However, random combinatorial synthesis of oligonucleotides for CDR sequence diversity also produces many clones with unnatural sequences and/or undesirable modification motifs. To alleviate these issues, we designed and constructed a novel semi-synthetic human scFv library with non-combinatorial, pre-designed CDR diversity and a single native human framework each for heavy, kappa, and lambda chain variable domains. Next-generation sequencing analysis indicated that the library consists of antibody clones with highly nature-like CDR sequences and the occurrence of the post-translational modification motifs is minimized. Multiple unique clones with nanomolar affinity could be isolated from the library against a number of target antigens, validating the library design strategy. The results demonstrate that it is possible to construct a functional antibody library using low, non-combinatorial synthetic CDR diversity, and provides a new strategy for the design of antibody libraries suitable for demanding applications.\n## Introduction\nTarget-specific antibodies can be rapidly isolated from a large antibody library by in vitro display technologies, such as phage or yeast display. The size and quality of the antibody library is a major determinant of the success of in vitro antibody generation, and many different strategies have been employed to design and construct large, highly functional antibody libraries [1]. While the size of an antibody library is mostly determined by the transformation efficiency of bacteria or yeast, multiple different factors can influence the functionality of a library and thus need to be considered in the library design. One important factor in library design is the source and nature of the sequence diversity, which can originate from natural (animal B-cells), synthetic, or semi-synthetic sources. \n\nAntibody libraries from natural sources consist of antibody clones with variable regions that are the end product of V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation of germline immunoglobulin genes, all of which are presumably optimized through the evolutionary history of adaptive immunity. Antibodies isolated from a natural antibody library are thus generally considered more nature-like than those from a synthetic antibody library, whose diversity typically is generated by random combinatorial events. On the other hand, the greater heterogeneity of the framework regions among the clones of natural antibody libraries may result in more uneven propagation of the clones during the amplification phase of biopanning. Also, somatic hypermutations, especially in the framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that can elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response when the antibody is used as a therapeutic agent. \n\nSynthetic antibody libraries usually have one or a small number of framework sequences, upon which artificially designed and synthesized CDR sequences are grafted. The CDR diversity is mostly generated by concatenating random nucleotides [2][3][4] or trinucleotide units [5][6][7]. Various CDR design strategies have been employed to emulate natural CDRs. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences to the library.",

These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies.",

Yet, the overall process of bringing antibodies from the early discovery phase into the market is a long and expensive one, with the investment increasing exponentially as the potential antibody-based drug progresses from discovery to preclinical development to clinical trials and finally reaches the market. \n\nOver decades, as therapeutic antibodies either moved through the process required for commercialization 2 or failed to perform in preclinical development and clinical trials, it has become clear that many of the properties that account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials, collectively called developability, 3,4 are encoded in the primary amino acid sequence of the antibody. This implies that the developability profile of an antibody can be engineered in the early discovery phase, where the costs of development are still relatively modest. Hence, there is substantial interest in, and demand for, the design and implementation of more robust and efficient discovery platforms capable of generating antibody sequences with the optimal developability profile in the earliest stages of development. \n\nPhage display has served as a key enabling technology for therapeutic antibody discovery. 5 This technology platform, which was developed in the late 1980s and perfected during the past three decades, [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] rests on the principle that more diverse, functional and larger libraries produce more diverse, specific and higher affinity antibodies. To generate larger and more diverse antibody libraries, three main approaches have been described in the literature, including: 1) na\u00efve libraries composed of natural diversity; 12 2) libraries based on rational design and synthesis of selected scaffolds; 9,11,14 and 3) semisynthetic libraries, which combine synthetic and natural fragments. 10 irst-generation phage display antibody libraries were na\u00efve. 12 Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library.",

P\u00e9rez-Tapia, R. Nelson, Omar U Guzm\u00e1n-Bringas, H. Arrieta-Oliva, Keyla M G\u00f3mez-Castellano, M. Pohl, J. C. Almagro\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT We describe here the design, construction and validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122. These single-chain variable fragment (scFv), semisynthetic libraries are built on synthetic human well-known IGHV and IGKV germline genes combined with natural human complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3/JH (H3J) fragments. One IGHV gene provided a universal VH scaffold and was paired with two IGKV scaffolds to furnish different topographies for binding distinct epitopes. The scaffolds were diversified at positions identified as in contact with antigens in the known antigen-antibody complex structures. The diversification regime consisted of high-usage amino acids found at those positions in human antibody sequences. Functionality, stability and diversity of the libraries were improved throughout a three-step construction process. In a first step, fully synthetic primary libraries were generated by combining the diversified scaffolds with a set of synthetic neutral H3J germline gene fragments. The second step consisted of selecting the primary libraries for enhanced thermostability based on the natural capacity of Protein A to bind the universal VH scaffold. In the third and final step, the resultant stable synthetic antibody fragments were combined with natural H3J fragments obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a large pool of 200 donors. Validation of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 with seven targets yielded specific antibodies in all the cases. Further characterization of the isolated antibodies indicated KD values as human IgG1 molecules in the single-digit and sub-nM range. The thermal stability (Tm) of all the antigen-binding fragments was 75\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C, demonstrating that ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 are a valuable source of specific, high affinity and highly stable antibodies.\n## Introduction\nAntibodies represent the fastest-growing segment of all the therapeutic proteins in the biotechnology industry. 1 This remarkable progress is due in part to the exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibodies, compounded with their stability, solubility, clinical tolerability and relatively straightforward manufacturing process compared to other biologics. Yet, the overall process of bringing antibodies from the early discovery phase into the market is a long and expensive one, with the investment increasing exponentially as the potential antibody-based drug progresses from discovery to preclinical development to clinical trials and finally reaches the market. \n\nOver decades, as therapeutic antibodies either moved through the process required for commercialization 2 or failed to perform in preclinical development and clinical trials, it has become clear that many of the properties that account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials, collectively called developability, 3,4 are encoded in the primary amino acid sequence of the antibody. This implies that the developability profile of an antibody can be engineered in the early discovery phase, where the costs of development are still relatively modest. Hence, there is substantial interest in, and demand for, the design and implementation of more robust and efficient discovery platforms capable of generating antibody sequences with the optimal developability profile in the earliest stages of development. \n\nPhage display has served as a key enabling technology for therapeutic antibody discovery. 5 This technology platform, which was developed in the late 1980s and perfected during the past three decades, [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] rests on the principle that more diverse, functional and larger libraries produce more diverse, specific and higher affinity antibodies. To generate larger and more diverse antibody libraries, three main approaches have been described in the literature, including: 1) na\u00efve libraries composed of natural diversity; 12 2) libraries based on rational design and synthesis of selected scaffolds; 9,11,14 and 3) semisynthetic libraries, which combine synthetic and natural fragments. 10 irst-generation phage display antibody libraries were na\u00efve. 12 Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library.",

This technology was initially developed by George Smith in the mid-1980s and applied by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter to antibody engineering at the beginning of 1990s. Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies.

                    "text": "Since the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

                    "text": "An important parameter and perhaps the simplest one to be considered when building an antibody phage display library is its size, as it correlates with the probability of selecting higher affinity antibodies, as predicted by Perelson [34]. The libraries described in Table 1 reached the maximum possible size of \u224810 11 antibody variants. With these library sizes, diverse, highly specific, and sub-nM binders have been obtained from nearly all of the libraries, regardless of the antibody repertoire type, be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic. The effective size of the libraries was on average 85%, meaning that there is room for a 15% improvement, assuming a 100% functionality could be reached. A 15% improvement in a repertoire of 10 11 molecules implies 1.5 \u00d7 10 10 additional antibody variants to select from. \n\nTo improve the effective size of the libraries, better DNA synthesis methods can be applied to increase the percentage of ORFs by reducing stop codons, frameshifts, and redundant and/or unwanted amino acids in the targeted positions for diversification. Current synthesis platforms, such as Twist Bioscience's silicon-based DNA synthesis platform, enables the precise synthesis of variants with a uniform incorporation of variants in each library, as validated by next-generation sequencing (https://www.twistbioscience.com/libraries_poster_precisionsynthesis). This precise synthesis method can be combined with libraries of antibody molecules with an enhanced developability profile. This can be done by incorporating better developability prediction methods in the design phase of the libraries. In this regard, new in silico tools [89] can identify antibody sequences that have anomalous developability values compared with therapeutics antibodies. This metric, called therapeutic antibody profiling (TAP), builds a downloadable structural model of an antibody V sequence and tests it against guideline thresholds of five calculated measures likely to be linked to poor developability. Therefore, by generating each possible variant of an antibody library in silico and filtering out those with poor TAP, non-developable variants can be replaced with developable ones.",

                    "text": "The method consists of building a library (left panel) of peptide or protein variants-or in the case of antibodies, an antibody gene repertoire-and affinity selecting (right panel) specific antibody-phage fusions via affinity with the target of interest. An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. Alternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16]. \n\nInitially, the main goal of phage display antibody discovery campaigns was to select for specific and high affinity antibodies [17]. In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials.",

                    "text": "While the library size can be defined by one number (N) and the effective size can be assessed by the percentage of antibody display, the diversity of a library has a somewhat elusive definition. Sometimes the size of an antibody repertoire is used as a proxy to characterize its diversity. However, it assumes that the antibody repertoire is a random set of antigen-binding site shapes and amino acid sidechains. Furthermore, not all antibody repertoires are created equal. \n\nFor instance, if one were to generate a library of antibody variants by diversifying all the 11 positions of the LCDR1 with the 20 amino acids, the resultant repertoire would be 20 11 or 2 \u00d7 10 14 antibody variants. This would appear to be a diverse repertoire based on its size and it would thus presumably lead to a large number of functional antibodies. Nevertheless, most of the amino acids in LCDR1 are located in the periphery of the antigen-binding site and have a marginal role in defining the binding properties of antibodies, especially for small and mid-sized targets [40]. Therefore, such a library would very likely be of limited use. In contrast, the same library size, e.g., 11 positions mutated to the 20 amino acids, but in the HCDR3, which is located at the center of the antigen-binding site and plays a critical role in recognizing diverse targets, would likely yield antibodies with reasonable affinity [41]. Hence, diversity is not only the number of in-frame and/or non-toxic antibody variants, but it is also the number of functional molecules capable of recognizing as many diverse targets as possible. \n\nThe first functional antibody repertoires used as a substrate to build phage display antibody libraries were obtained from immunized animals [42] or humans [43]. This type of library, known as immune, has been of limited application as general-purpose platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. Those obtained from immunized animals are single-use libraries as the libraries are biased toward the recognition of the antigen utilized as an immunogen. More importantly, the antibodies obtained from immune libraries, being nonhuman proteins, require further engineering (humanization), which increases the cost of the antibody drug development process.",

                    "text": "In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.",

Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies.

An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. \n\nAlternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16].

Almagro, Martha Pedraza-Escalona, Hugo Iv\u00e1n Arrieta, S. P\u00e9rez-Tapia\n## Abstract\nPhage display technology has played a key role in the remarkable progress of discovering and optimizing antibodies for diverse applications, particularly antibody-based drugs. This technology was initially developed by George Smith in the mid-1980s and applied by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter to antibody engineering at the beginning of 1990s. Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges pertaining to phage display platforms and related display technologies.\n## Introduction\nThe method consists of building a library (left panel) of peptide or protein variants-or in the case of antibodies, an antibody gene repertoireand affinity selecting (right panel) specific antibody-phage fusions via affinity with the target of interest. An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. \n\nAlternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16].

In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials.\n...\nIn the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.\n\n## Types of Antibody Repertoires\nWhile the library size can be defined by one number (N) and the effective size can be assessed by the percentage of antibody display, the diversity of a library has a somewhat elusive definition. Sometimes the size of an antibody repertoire is used as a proxy to characterize its diversity. However, it assumes that the antibody repertoire is a random set of antigen-binding site shapes and amino acid sidechains. Furthermore, not all antibody repertoires are created equal. \n\nFor instance, if one were to generate a library of antibody variants by diversifying all the 11 positions of the LCDR1 with the 20 amino acids, the resultant repertoire would be 20 11 or 2 \u00d7 10 14 antibody variants. This would appear to be a diverse repertoire based on its size and it would thus presumably lead to a large number of functional antibodies. Nevertheless, most of the amino acids in LCDR1 are located in the periphery of the antigen-binding site and have a marginal role in defining the binding properties of antibodies, especially for small and mid-sized targets [40]. Therefore, such a library would very likely be of limited use. In contrast, the same library size, e.g., 11 positions mutated to the 20 amino acids, but in the HCDR3, which is located at the center of the antigen-binding site and plays a critical role in recognizing diverse targets, would likely yield antibodies with reasonable affinity [41]. Hence, diversity is not only the number of in-frame and/or non-toxic antibody variants, but it is also the number of functional molecules capable of recognizing as many diverse targets as possible. \n\nThe first functional antibody repertoires used as a substrate to build phage display antibody libraries were obtained from immunized animals [42] or humans [43]. This type of library, known as immune, has been of limited application as general-purpose platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. Those obtained from immunized animals are single-use libraries as the libraries are biased toward the recognition of the antigen utilized as an immunogen. More importantly, the antibodies obtained from immune libraries, being nonhuman proteins, require further engineering (humanization), which increases the cost of the antibody drug development process.\n\n## Current Opportunities and Challenges\nAn important parameter and perhaps the simplest one to be considered when building an antibody phage display library is its size, as it correlates with the probability of selecting higher affinity antibodies, as predicted by Perelson [34]. The libraries described in Table 1 reached the maximum possible size of \u224810 11 antibody variants. With these library sizes, diverse, highly specific, and sub-nM binders have been obtained from nearly all of the libraries, regardless of the antibody repertoire type, be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic. The effective size of the libraries was on average 85%, meaning that there is room for a 15% improvement, assuming a 100% functionality could be reached. A 15% improvement in a repertoire of 10 11 molecules implies 1.5 \u00d7 10 10 additional antibody variants to select from. \n\nTo improve the effective size of the libraries, better DNA synthesis methods can be applied to increase the percentage of ORFs by reducing stop codons, frameshifts, and redundant and/or unwanted amino acids in the targeted positions for diversification. Current synthesis platforms, such as Twist Bioscience's silicon-based DNA synthesis platform, enables the precise synthesis of variants with a uniform incorporation of variants in each library, as validated by next-generation sequencing (https://www.twistbioscience.com/libraries_poster_precisionsynthesis). This precise synthesis method can be combined with libraries of antibody molecules with an enhanced developability profile. This can be done by incorporating better developability prediction methods in the design phase of the libraries. In this regard, new in silico tools [89] can identify antibody sequences that have anomalous developability values compared with therapeutics antibodies. This metric, called therapeutic antibody profiling (TAP), builds a downloadable structural model of an antibody V sequence and tests it against guideline thresholds of five calculated measures likely to be linked to poor developability. Therefore, by generating each possible variant of an antibody library in silico and filtering out those with poor TAP, non-developable variants can be replaced with developable ones.\n\n## Concluding Remarks\nSince the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

We obtained a database of unique 7,373 VH and 41,804 VK sequences by 454 pyrosequencing, and analyzed the repertoires. The distribution of VH and VK subfamilies and germline genes in our antibody repertoires slightly differed from those in earlier published natural antibody libraries. The frequency of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) in heavy-chain complementarity determining region (HCDR)1 and HCDR2 are higher compared with the natural IgM repertoire. Analysis of position-specific SHMs in CDRs indicates that asparagine, threonine, arginine, aspartate and phenylalanine are the most frequent non-germline residues on the antibody-antigen interface and are converted mostly from the germline residues, which are highly represented in germline SHM hotspots. The amino acid composition and length-dependent changes in amino acid frequencies of HCDR3 are similar to those in previous reports, except that frequencies of aspartate and phenylalanine are a little higher in our repertoire. Taken together, the results show that this antibody library shares common features of natural antibody repertoires and also has unique features. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human antibodies against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display.

Park, Seung Gu Park, Seulki Cho, Jin Hong Kim, N. S. Ipper, S. Choi, Eung Suk Lee, H. Hong\n## Abstract\nWe constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \u00d7 1010 colonies) from the lymphocytes of 809 human donors, assessed available diversities of the heavy-chain variable (VH) and \u03ba light-chain variable (VK) domain repertoires, and validated the library by selecting Fabs against 10 therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. We obtained a database of unique 7,373 VH and 41,804 VK sequences by 454 pyrosequencing, and analyzed the repertoires. The distribution of VH and VK subfamilies and germline genes in our antibody repertoires slightly differed from those in earlier published natural antibody libraries. The frequency of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) in heavy-chain complementarity determining region (HCDR)1 and HCDR2 are higher compared with the natural IgM repertoire. Analysis of position-specific SHMs in CDRs indicates that asparagine, threonine, arginine, aspartate and phenylalanine are the most frequent non-germline residues on the antibody-antigen interface and are converted mostly from the germline residues, which are highly represented in germline SHM hotspots. The amino acid composition and length-dependent changes in amino acid frequencies of HCDR3 are similar to those in previous reports, except that frequencies of aspartate and phenylalanine are a little higher in our repertoire. Taken together, the results show that this antibody library shares common features of natural antibody repertoires and also has unique features. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human antibodies against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.\n## Molecules and Cells\nPhage display has become the most frequently used display technology, with the advantage of robustness due to high stability of the phage (Hoet et al., 2005). The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human mAbs against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

Antibody phage display (APD) provides the opportunity to design and construct large libraries of antibody fragments. The expression of antibodies on the surface of phage particles represents a powerful platform for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with desired binding characteristics that can serve for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of various disorders especially infectious diseases [35]. \n\nAccording to the source of antibody-encoding sequences, phage antibody libraries (PALs) are divided into two main types of natural and synthetic libraries. Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors. This type of antibody library has been constructed from different species including human, non-human primates, mouse, chicken, sheep, camel, and cattle. Immune libraries are considered as the most useful type of PALs for infectious diseases. They are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36,37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs).",

Additionally, their high stability, easily modifiable surface, and enormous diversity in shape and size, distinguish viruses from synthetic nanocarriers used for drug delivery. Indeed, several plant and bacterial viruses (e.g., phages) have been investigated and applied as drug carriers. The ability to remove the genetic material within the capsids of some plant viruses and phages produces empty viral-like particles that are replication-deficient and can be loaded with therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the current applications of plant viruses and phages in drug discovery and as drug delivery systems and includes a discussion of the present status of virus-based materials in clinical research, alongside the observed challenges and opportunities.",

Moreover, due to the lack of affinity maturation, these universal libraries have low risk of immunogenicity [133]. In principle, a universal library can be applicable to mAb selection of any type of antigen. This is because the library comprises a high variability of antibody genes and comprises antibody genes from many donors [132]. Universal libraries are further sub-classified as na\u00efve, semi-synthetic, or fully-synthetic. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed from the natural human IgM repertoire (i.e., from not intentionally immunized donors) [132,133]. Examples of na\u00efve universal libraries are the human Fab library constructed by de Haard and colleagues at Dyax (now Shire) [137], the scFv libraries from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) [142,143], scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA59, and the HAL scFv libraries [135,144]. Fully synthetic libraries are constructed to include synthetic genes derived from known (human) antibody frameworks with the capacity to generate a large diversity in appropriate regions [145]. Semi-synthetic libraries are a combination of natural (i.e., donor-derived antibody) and synthetic antibody sequences [138]. A combination of na\u00efve and synthetic repertoires was used for the Dyax FAB310 library. Fully-synthetic libraries were developed by MorphoSys [133]. In addition, a particular type of antibody library is generated during guided phage display selection of human antibody using a non-human original antibody sequence. This strategy has been used for humanization and the discovery of fully human antibodies with similar properties to the murine antibody template, such as adalimumab [146].\n\nOverall, the identification of mAbs and mAb derivatives by phage display technology was a breakthrough that has enabled the isolation of human antibodies towards many types of antigen without immunization. Since then, it is one of the main platforms for generation of human therapeutic antibodies together with transgenic immunized mice, antibody humanization techniques, and single B-cell expression cloning [169].",

Gauthier\n## Abstract\nViruses have recently emerged as promising nanomaterials for biotechnological applications. One of the most important applications of viruses is phage display, which has already been employed to identify a broad range of potential therapeutic peptides and antibodies, as well as other biotechnologically relevant polypeptides (including protease inhibitors, minimizing proteins, and cell/organ targeting peptides). Additionally, their high stability, easily modifiable surface, and enormous diversity in shape and size, distinguish viruses from synthetic nanocarriers used for drug delivery. Indeed, several plant and bacterial viruses (e.g., phages) have been investigated and applied as drug carriers. The ability to remove the genetic material within the capsids of some plant viruses and phages produces empty viral-like particles that are replication-deficient and can be loaded with therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the current applications of plant viruses and phages in drug discovery and as drug delivery systems and includes a discussion of the present status of virus-based materials in clinical research, alongside the observed challenges and opportunities.\n## Phage Display-Derived Therapeutics\nare generated by a source for which the immune system had not been activated to recognize a specific antigen (na\u00efve) [132]. Moreover, due to the lack of affinity maturation, these universal libraries have low risk of immunogenicity [133]. In principle, a universal library can be applicable to mAb selection of any type of antigen. This is because the library comprises a high variability of antibody genes and comprises antibody genes from many donors [132]. Universal libraries are further sub-classified as na\u00efve, semi-synthetic, or fully-synthetic. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed from the natural human IgM repertoire (i.e., from not intentionally immunized donors) [132,133]. Examples of na\u00efve universal libraries are the human Fab library constructed by de Haard and colleagues at Dyax (now Shire) [137], the scFv libraries from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) [142,143], scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA59, and the HAL scFv libraries [135,144]. Fully synthetic libraries are constructed to include synthetic genes derived from known (human) antibody frameworks with the capacity to generate a large diversity in appropriate regions [145]. Semi-synthetic libraries are a combination of natural (i.e., donor-derived antibody) and synthetic antibody sequences [138]. A combination of na\u00efve and synthetic repertoires was used for the Dyax FAB310 library. Fully-synthetic libraries were developed by MorphoSys [133]. In addition, a particular type of antibody library is generated during guided phage display selection of human antibody using a non-human original antibody sequence. This strategy has been used for humanization and the discovery of fully human antibodies with similar properties to the murine antibody template, such as adalimumab [146].\n\nOverall, the identification of mAbs and mAb derivatives by phage display technology was a breakthrough that has enabled the isolation of human antibodies towards many types of antigen without immunization. Since then, it is one of the main platforms for generation of human therapeutic antibodies together with transgenic immunized mice, antibody humanization techniques, and single B-cell expression cloning [169].",

In most cases, large repertoires of antibody genes have been assembled to create highly diversified libraries allowing the isolation of antibodies recognizing virtually any antigen. However, these universal libraries might not allow the isolation of antibodies with specific structural properties or particular amino acid contents that are rarely found in natural repertoires. Purpose-oriented libraries specially designed to incorporate desired characteristics have been successfully used. However, the workload required for library construction has limited the attractiveness of this approach compared to the use of large universal libraries. We have developed an approach to capture synthetic or natural diversity into the complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3) of human antibody repertoires using Type IIS restriction enzymes. In this way, we generated several libraries either biased in amino acid content or towards long CDRH3 loops. The latter were successfully used to identify antibodies inhibiting the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase, whereas libraries enriched in histidines allowed for the isolation of antibodies binding to human Fc in a pH-dependent manner. These libraries indicate that tailored diversification of CDR3 is sufficient to generate purpose-oriented libraries and isolate antibodies with uncommon properties.",

                    "text": "Over the last two decades, in vitro selection technologies have matured as effective alternatives to animal immunization for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since the first description that antibody fragments can be expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and selected for specific binding to a target, phage display has become one of the most widely used in vitro approaches for the generation of antibodies for research and therapeutic applications [1,2]. More recently, the display of antibodies at the surface of yeast or mammalian cells, as well as cell free systems, such as ribosome display, have complemented the panel of technologies available for the isolation and engineering of antibodies and other protein scaffolds [3,4]. Regardless of the display package used for in vitro isolation of antibodies, a collection of diversified genes encoding antibody variable regions has to be generated. The diversity and quality of such an antibody gene library is of critical importance for success and the correlation between the number and affinity of antibodies that can be isolated and the library size has been demonstrated [5]. Thus, there has been significant effort to assemble very large antibody libraries, i.e., comprising between 10 8 and >10 11 members, so that, in principle, antibodies against any antigen can be identified [6][7][8]. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed either by capturing naturally rearranged immunoglobulin genes isolated from B cells or using synthetic approaches relying on mutagenesis of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described [9]. In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen [10,11]. In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher.",

Kosco-Vilbois, N. Fischer, A. Nissim\n## Abstract\nThe development of in vitro antibody selection technologies has allowed overcoming some limitations inherent to the hybridoma technology. In most cases, large repertoires of antibody genes have been assembled to create highly diversified libraries allowing the isolation of antibodies recognizing virtually any antigen. However, these universal libraries might not allow the isolation of antibodies with specific structural properties or particular amino acid contents that are rarely found in natural repertoires. Purpose-oriented libraries specially designed to incorporate desired characteristics have been successfully used. However, the workload required for library construction has limited the attractiveness of this approach compared to the use of large universal libraries. We have developed an approach to capture synthetic or natural diversity into the complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3) of human antibody repertoires using Type IIS restriction enzymes. In this way, we generated several libraries either biased in amino acid content or towards long CDRH3 loops. The latter were successfully used to identify antibodies inhibiting the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase, whereas libraries enriched in histidines allowed for the isolation of antibodies binding to human Fc in a pH-dependent manner. These libraries indicate that tailored diversification of CDR3 is sufficient to generate purpose-oriented libraries and isolate antibodies with uncommon properties.\n## Introduction\nOver the last two decades, in vitro selection technologies have matured as effective alternatives to animal immunization for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since the first description that antibody fragments can be expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and selected for specific binding to a target, phage display has become one of the most widely used in vitro approaches for the generation of antibodies for research and therapeutic applications [1,2]. More recently, the display of antibodies at the surface of yeast or mammalian cells, as well as cell free systems, such as ribosome display, have complemented the panel of technologies available for the isolation and engineering of antibodies and other protein scaffolds [3,4]. Regardless of the display package used for in vitro isolation of antibodies, a collection of diversified genes encoding antibody variable regions has to be generated. The diversity and quality of such an antibody gene library is of critical importance for success and the correlation between the number and affinity of antibodies that can be isolated and the library size has been demonstrated [5]. Thus, there has been significant effort to assemble very large antibody libraries, i.e., comprising between 10 8 and >10 11 members, so that, in principle, antibodies against any antigen can be identified [6][7][8]. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed either by capturing naturally rearranged immunoglobulin genes isolated from B cells or using synthetic approaches relying on mutagenesis of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described [9]. In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen [10,11]. In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher.",

These include high affinity and specificity for the intended target, biological activity, and additional characteristics now known as \u201cdevelopability properties\u201d: long-term stability and resistance to aggregation when in solution, thermodynamic stability to prevent unfolding, high expression yields to facilitate manufacturing, low self-interaction, among others. Sequence-based liabilities may affect one or more of these characteristics. Improving the stability and developability of a lead antibody is typically achieved by modifying its sequence, a time-consuming process that often results in reduced affinity. Here we present a new antibody library format that yields high-affinity binders with drug-like developability properties directly from initial selections, reducing the need for further engineering or affinity maturation. The innovative semi-synthetic design involves grafting natural complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from human antibodies into scaffolds based on well-behaved clinical antibodies. HCDR3s were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs, from which all sequence liabilities had been purged, were replicated from a large next-generation sequencing dataset. By combining two in vitro display techniques, phage and yeast display, we were able to routinely recover a large number of unique, highly developable antibodies against clinically relevant targets with affinities in the subnanomolar to low nanomolar range. We anticipate that the designs and approaches presented here will accelerate the drug development process by reducing the failure rate of leads due to poor antibody affinities and developability.

In the case of natural libraries, the random nature of variable heavy and variable light (VH/VL) chain pairing may create poorly developable combinations, while synthetic diversity may create artificial complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences that fold poorly. \n\nWe hypothesized that a library comprising a defined collection of natural CDR sequences from which most known sequence-based liabilities were eliminated, embedded within paired frameworks derived exclusively from well-behaved therapeutic molecules, would facilitate the discovery of highly developable antibodies directly from the library. Reasoning that the stringent quality control applied to antibodies undergoing natural B-cell maturation would also apply to their individual CDRs, a library comprising replicated natural CDRs informatically purged of sequence liabilities could provide superior biophysical properties when used as a diversity source. While it remains difficult to predict the relevant properties of therapeutic antibodies on the basis of primary sequence alone, many short sequence liabilities have been identified, particularly those related to chemical instability or polyreactivity, including, for example, N-glycosylation motifs, asparagine deamidation motifs, aspartate isomerization motifs, unpaired cysteines, surface hydrophobic/aromatic patches and others (Table 1). \n\nBuilding on pioneer antibody library designs (generation 1) [17][18][19][20][21][22] and other designs that further improved the capabilities of in vitro antibody discovery (generation 2), [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] here we present a \"Generation 3\" library architecture that leverages developability data on therapeutic antibodies, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of human repertoires, and high-throughput synthetic oligonucleotide synthesis to create a platform able to yield large numbers of high affinity, developable antibodies against any target.",

F. Erasmus, S. D\u2019Angelo, L. Naranjo, F. Ferrara, Camila Leal-Lopes, O. Durrant, Cecile Galmiche, Aleardo Morelli, Anthony Scott-Tucker, A. Bradbury\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT Therapeutic antibodies must have \u201cdrug-like\u201d properties. These include high affinity and specificity for the intended target, biological activity, and additional characteristics now known as \u201cdevelopability properties\u201d: long-term stability and resistance to aggregation when in solution, thermodynamic stability to prevent unfolding, high expression yields to facilitate manufacturing, low self-interaction, among others. Sequence-based liabilities may affect one or more of these characteristics. Improving the stability and developability of a lead antibody is typically achieved by modifying its sequence, a time-consuming process that often results in reduced affinity. Here we present a new antibody library format that yields high-affinity binders with drug-like developability properties directly from initial selections, reducing the need for further engineering or affinity maturation. The innovative semi-synthetic design involves grafting natural complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from human antibodies into scaffolds based on well-behaved clinical antibodies. HCDR3s were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs, from which all sequence liabilities had been purged, were replicated from a large next-generation sequencing dataset. By combining two in vitro display techniques, phage and yeast display, we were able to routinely recover a large number of unique, highly developable antibodies against clinically relevant targets with affinities in the subnanomolar to low nanomolar range. We anticipate that the designs and approaches presented here will accelerate the drug development process by reducing the failure rate of leads due to poor antibody affinities and developability.

In the case of natural libraries, the random nature of variable heavy and variable light (VH/VL) chain pairing may create poorly developable combinations, while synthetic diversity may create artificial complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences that fold poorly. \n\nWe hypothesized that a library comprising a defined collection of natural CDR sequences from which most known sequence-based liabilities were eliminated, embedded within paired frameworks derived exclusively from well-behaved therapeutic molecules, would facilitate the discovery of highly developable antibodies directly from the library. Reasoning that the stringent quality control applied to antibodies undergoing natural B-cell maturation would also apply to their individual CDRs, a library comprising replicated natural CDRs informatically purged of sequence liabilities could provide superior biophysical properties when used as a diversity source. While it remains difficult to predict the relevant properties of therapeutic antibodies on the basis of primary sequence alone, many short sequence liabilities have been identified, particularly those related to chemical instability or polyreactivity, including, for example, N-glycosylation motifs, asparagine deamidation motifs, aspartate isomerization motifs, unpaired cysteines, surface hydrophobic/aromatic patches and others (Table 1). \n\nBuilding on pioneer antibody library designs (generation 1) [17][18][19][20][21][22] and other designs that further improved the capabilities of in vitro antibody discovery (generation 2), [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] here we present a \"Generation 3\" library architecture that leverages developability data on therapeutic antibodies, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of human repertoires, and high-throughput synthetic oligonucleotide synthesis to create a platform able to yield large numbers of high affinity, developable antibodies against any target.",

An antibody library, a large collection of diverse, pre-constructed antibodies, can be rapidly screened using in vitro display technologies such as phage display. One of the keys to successful in vitro antibody discovery is the quality of the library diversity. Antibody diversity can be obtained either from natural B-cell sources or by the synthetic methods that combinatorially generate random nucleotide sequences.

V variable domain, C constant domain, H heavy chain, L light chain immunisation and library cloning for each antigen but small repertoire libraries (~ 10 6 ) usually facilitate the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [7][8][9]). On the other hand, na\u00efve or synthetic/semi-synthetic libraries (collectively known as single-pot libraries) can be used against any antigen but are required to have very high diversity (typically > 10 10 ) to allow the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [12][13][14][15][16]). \n\nIn terms of antibody formats, Fabs consist of the VH-CH1 and VL-CL chains, one of which is fused to the pIII protein [17]. In phage display systems these two chains are usually expressed separately and assemble into the Fab format within the periplasm of the bacteria via a disulphide bond linkage.",

Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002;Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams & Sidhu, 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015). \n\nThe capacity of fully synthetic antibody libraries was theoretically the largest, but there were key issues that need to be addressed, such as conserved sequencing of backbone regions (Benhar, 2007). \n\nThe phage display single chain antibody libraries were the recombinant phage libraries consisting of a large number of individual phages with different scFvs. In this large scFv libraries, after 3-4 rounds of screening, one or more scFvs will bind specifically to some molecule or the receptor on the surface of the target. This scFv provided an effective method for subsequent disease treatment or diagnosis (Li et al., 2022).",

Tong, Bocui Song\n## Abstract\nPhage display technology has become an important research tool in biological research, fundamentally changing the traditional monoclonal antibody preparation process, and has been widely used in the establishment of antigen-antibody libraries, drug design, vaccine research, pathogen detection, gene therapy, antigenic epitope research, and cellular signal transduction research.The phage display is a powerful platform for technology development. Using phage display technology, single chain fragment variable (scFv) can be screened, replacing the disadvantage of the large size of traditional antibodies. Phage display single chain antibody libraries have significant biological implications. Here we describe the types of antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and scFvs. In addition, we describe the phage display system, phage display single chain antibody libraries, screening of specific antibodies by phage libraries and the application of phage libraries.\n## Phage display single chain antibody libraries\nPhage display libraries included natural antibody libraries, semi-synthetic antibody libraries, and synthetic antibody libraries. Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002;Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams & Sidhu, 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015). \n\nThe capacity of fully synthetic antibody libraries was theoretically the largest, but there were key issues that need to be addressed, such as conserved sequencing of backbone regions (Benhar, 2007). \n\nThe phage display single chain antibody libraries were the recombinant phage libraries consisting of a large number of individual phages with different scFvs. In this large scFv libraries, after 3-4 rounds of screening, one or more scFvs will bind specifically to some molecule or the receptor on the surface of the target. This scFv provided an effective method for subsequent disease treatment or diagnosis (Li et al., 2022).",

Evidently, infectious diseases have contributed to an alarming rate of mortality worldwide making it a growing concern. Historically, antibodies have been used successfully to prevent and treat infectious diseases since the nineteenth century using antisera collected from immunized animals. The inherent ability of antibodies to trigger effector mechanisms aids the immune system to fight off pathogens that invades the host. Immune libraries have always been an important source of antibodies for infectious diseases due to the skewed repertoire generated post infection.

Antibody libraries are useful assets for antibody development programs as they can be applied for various targets for multiple applications. In general, antibody libraries are classified into four categories, namely the na\u00efve, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. The classification of the antibody libraries are mainly influenced by the source of antibody V genes for library generation [93]. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using V genes from non-immunized donors [93,94]. Immune antibody libraries however are constructed utilizing antibody V genes from immunized donors or infected individuals [93]. Synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries are constructed using synthesized DNA oligonucleotides where the repertoire diversity is devoid of any natural immune maturation processes [95]. This chapter will focus on the principles and characteristics of na\u00efve libraries including the application of antibodies derived from na\u00efve libraries in combating infectious diseases.\n\nNa\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using B cells of unimmunized or healthy donors, normally focusing on the IgM isotype. Na\u00efve libraries are supposedly able to be used for the isolation of mAbs against any antigen [96]. The process involved in the generation of na\u00efve antibody libraries is well established and has been described in numerous publications [97][98][99][100]. The human natural antibody repertoire is approximately 10 11 in size, which is a thousand times larger than the murine na\u00efve antibody repertoire [101]. However, antibodies isolated from na\u00efve antibody libraries usually exhibit lower affinities compared to antibodies isolated from immunized libraries. This is because the na\u00efve repertoire would not have undergone in vivo affinity maturation to produce higher affinity antibodies [96]. During antibody library generation, several critical aspects that are monitored includes library size and repertoire diversity in determining the quality of the library [102]. In the case of na\u00efve libraries, larger library sizes are preferred to ensure higher affinity mAbs are isolated. The correlation between larger library sizes with higher affinity mAbs has been reported in several instances as high affinity clones were successfully retrieved from larger size libraries compared to smaller size antibody libraries [93,103,104].\n\nThe actual source where antibody genes are retrieved from is a vital consideration during the construction process of antibody libraries.

Rahumatullah, Jing Yi Lai, T. S. Lim\n## Abstract\nMany countries are facing an uphill battle in combating the spread of infectious diseases. The constant evolution of microorganisms magnifies the problem as it facilitates the re-emergence of old infectious diseases as well as promote the introduction of new and more deadly variants. Evidently, infectious diseases have contributed to an alarming rate of mortality worldwide making it a growing concern. Historically, antibodies have been used successfully to prevent and treat infectious diseases since the nineteenth century using antisera collected from immunized animals. The inherent ability of antibodies to trigger effector mechanisms aids the immune system to fight off pathogens that invades the host. Immune libraries have always been an important source of antibodies for infectious diseases due to the skewed repertoire generated post infection. Even so, the role and ability of na\u00efve antibody libraries should not be underestimated. The na\u00efve repertoire has its own unique advantages in generating antibodies against target antigens. This chapter will highlight the concept, advantages and application of human na\u00efve libraries as a source to isolate antibodies against infectious disease target antigens.\n## Construction of Na\u00efve Antibody Library for Phage Display\nAs highlighted earlier, the basic requirement for antibody phage display is the accessibility of an antibody library for screening. Antibody libraries are useful assets for antibody development programs as they can be applied for various targets for multiple applications. In general, antibody libraries are classified into four categories, namely the na\u00efve, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. The classification of the antibody libraries are mainly influenced by the source of antibody V genes for library generation [93]. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using V genes from non-immunized donors [93,94]. Immune antibody libraries however are constructed utilizing antibody V genes from immunized donors or infected individuals [93]. Synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries are constructed using synthesized DNA oligonucleotides where the repertoire diversity is devoid of any natural immune maturation processes [95]. This chapter will focus on the principles and characteristics of na\u00efve libraries including the application of antibodies derived from na\u00efve libraries in combating infectious diseases.\n\nNa\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using B cells of unimmunized or healthy donors, normally focusing on the IgM isotype. Na\u00efve libraries are supposedly able to be used for the isolation of mAbs against any antigen [96]. The process involved in the generation of na\u00efve antibody libraries is well established and has been described in numerous publications [97][98][99][100]. The human natural antibody repertoire is approximately 10 11 in size, which is a thousand times larger than the murine na\u00efve antibody repertoire [101]. However, antibodies isolated from na\u00efve antibody libraries usually exhibit lower affinities compared to antibodies isolated from immunized libraries. This is because the na\u00efve repertoire would not have undergone in vivo affinity maturation to produce higher affinity antibodies [96]. During antibody library generation, several critical aspects that are monitored includes library size and repertoire diversity in determining the quality of the library [102]. In the case of na\u00efve libraries, larger library sizes are preferred to ensure higher affinity mAbs are isolated. The correlation between larger library sizes with higher affinity mAbs has been reported in several instances as high affinity clones were successfully retrieved from larger size libraries compared to smaller size antibody libraries [93,103,104].\n\nThe actual source where antibody genes are retrieved from is a vital consideration during the construction process of antibody libraries.

Effective development of therapeutic antibodies demands high-quality molecules to meet strict manufacturing requirements and success in clinical applications. The first step in antibody discovery is the identification of potential candidate binding targets of interest, with two main methods used: hybridoma generation (or more recently single-cell cloning methods) from the immunization of normal or transgenic animals, and display methods based on naive or immune libraries. The source of diversity for libraries from which antibodies are selected has taken many formats: immune repertoires, generated from immunized animals or humans seropositive for a target; natural naive, derived from the B lymphocytes of nonimmunized donors [1][2][3] ; synthetic, in which diversity is derived from oligonucleotides [4][5][6][7][8][9] ; semi-synthetic, combining synthetic and natural diversity 10 ; and PCR-based recombinatorial approaches in which natural CDR diversity is shuffled within a fixed scaffold 11,12 . \n\nSpecific binders are selected from libraries displayed using platforms such as phage/phagemid 1,13,14 , yeast 15,16 , ribosome 17,18 , and mammalian display [19][20][21] , with phage and yeast display being the most commonly used. These methods couple phenotype to genotype: the gene encoding the displayed antibody is coupled to the antibody itself, allowing the cloning of antibody genes on the basis of the properties (e.g., binding activity) of the encoded antibodies. Once selected, the affinity or specificity of an antibody can be further improved by applying the same display methods to derivative libraries. \n\nThe key feature of any compound library, including antibody libraries, is diversity. In the case of antibody libraries, this is often measured by counting the number of clones obtained after library transformation. However, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 .",

Based on the fusion of antibody fragments to M13 filamentous bacteriophage envelope proteins (17), phage display libraries can generate tremendous diversity of antibody fragments on the phage surface (18,19). With standard panning methodologies, up to hundreds of phage binders can be isolated. Phage display antibody libraries have proven to be a powerful and efficient tool to isolate diagnostic or potential therapeutic antibodies (18). \n\nThere are many types of phage display libraries such as natural, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic; and they are classified by the source of their sequences (19). A natural library can be obtained from various human B-cells and are relatively similar to the natural human antibody repertoire. Immune libraries are constructed from infection-recovered humans or immunized animals and can yield high affinity binders against targets from a small sized immune library (~10 6 ). The diversity of a semi-synthetic library is increased through mutating one or more CDRs by using oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis or mixing synthetic and natural sequences (18,19). A synthetic library is composed of artificially designed and synthesized antibody sequences (20,21). Engineered semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries have several advantages including the use of scaffolds with highly stable properties and codon-optimized sequences with high expression levels (21, 22). Generally, immune libraries are directed towards limited number of targets. Natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic libraries can be used to isolate high affinity binders against broad antigens but are required to have very high diversity (~10 10 to 10 11 ). \n\nThe size and quality of diversity design and functional clones of the antibody library are crucial for the success of isolating potential therapeutic antibodies (20)(21)(22).",

            "text": "Phage display libraries included natural antibody libraries, semi-synthetic antibody libraries, and synthetic antibody libraries. Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002;Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams & Sidhu, 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015). \n\nThe capacity of fully synthetic antibody libraries was theoretically the largest, but there were key issues that need to be addressed, such as conserved sequencing of backbone regions (Benhar, 2007). \n\nThe phage display single chain antibody libraries were the recombinant phage libraries consisting of a large number of individual phages with different scFvs. In this large scFv libraries, after 3-4 rounds of screening, one or more scFvs will bind specifically to some molecule or the receptor on the surface of the target. This scFv provided an effective method for subsequent disease treatment or diagnosis (Li et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Over the past 15 years the generation of therapeutic antibodies from combinatorial antibody libraries has been established as a valid alternative to conventional immunization. To isolate candidates from such libraries the antibodies or antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of cells, phages, ribosomes or within the cell. Among those display methods, phage display has the longest history and it is among the technologies most commonly used today. While the choice of the antibody format can be limited by the display method, e.g., to the scFv or the Fab in the case of phage display, library design is in principle independent, as long as sufficient expression properties in the respective host system are ensured. \n\nCombinatorial antibody libraries differ in design, origin of sequence diversity and method of generation. All three aspects have an impact on the most essential features of a library: its size and functional diversity reflected in the ability to deliver high affinity antibodies with good biophysical properties. Antibody libraries can be classified into three major groups: na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. Most libraries aim at maximizing library diversity, but differ in their approaches of maximizing functional size and subsequent developability of the selected molecules. Limitation to a single stable framework or to a selected number of consensus frameworks to ensure good biophysical properties is one trend in this context. Currently there is a trend to be as close to human germline as possible, both in the choice of framework and CDR composition, to avoid potential issues of immunogenicity. \n\nWith the synthetic library of moderate size described by Pini and coworkers, scFvs were selected with monovalent affinities down to 10 nM [57]. Affinities achieved with large semi-synthetic libraries described by Hoet and S\u00f6derlind reached the sub-nanomolar range, whereas antibodies in the lower picomolar range have been isolated directly from the fully synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM \u00ae library as well as the very large na\u00efve CAT2.0 library. Affinity improvement factors vary widely within each method and are highly dependent on both the antigen as well as the starting molecule. The approaches targeting CDR regions have advantages concerning functional size of maturation libraries and integrity of antibody framework.",

            "text": "Phage display has become the most frequently used display technology, with the advantage of robustness due to high stability of the phage (Hoet et al., 2005). The in vitro methods employ a na\u00efve antibody library generated from donor-derived B cells, a synthetic library from synthetically derived diversity, or a semi-synthetic library derived from a combination of these two approaches, which differ in framework region (FR) composition and CDR diversification (Glanville et al., 2009;Hoogenboom, 2005;Kugler et al., 2015;Lloyd et al., 2009;Tiller et al., 2013;Zhai et al., 2011). The most commonly used antibody formats for phage display are single-chain Fv (scFv) and Fab. ScFv fragments are moderately stable on average and often have a high tendency to form multimers as well as aggregates, whereas Fab fragments have been found to possess comparably higher structural stability by an additional interface of the constant domains (Rothlisberger et al., 2005). For these reasons, Fab has replaced the scFv as a display format in many of recent phage libraries (Ponsel et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we constructed a large na\u00efve human Fab library (3 \uf0b4 10 10 colonies) from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow of 809 human donors and assessed available diversities of the VH and \u03ba VL (VK) repertoires in the entire library by 454 pyrosequencing. In addition, we validated the antibody library by selecting specific Fabs against 10 different therapeutically relevant antigens by phage display. The antibody library will be useful in the generation of human mAbs against diverse antigens, and the information about the diversity of natural antibody repertoires will be valuable in the future design of synthetic human antibody libraries with high functional diversity.",

            "text": "Phage display has proven to be an unequivocal success for antibody discovery, evidenced by 17 approved mAbs and an increasing number of phage-derived antibodies under clinical investigation. As an entirely in vitro technology, phage display not only compensates for many limitations inherited by in vivo antibody discovery approaches, it also provides a highly versatile and customizable platform that continuously evolves to meet distinct development goals.\n\nAffinity is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a phage library. It has been observed that affinity that can be achieved is correlated with the library size. We investigated the correlation between highest affinity values obtained from published universal phage libraries and library size (data not shown). In agreement with previous observations, there is a positive correlation between the two parameters. This is because a universal library is designed for antibody discovery against any given target. Therefore, a larger library (higher diversity) offers a greater chance of identifying high affinity antibodies. In the case of a synthetic library, although a limited number of frameworks are used, the designed CDR diversity usually far exceeds the natural CDR diversity. Therefore, the chance to obtain high affinity antibodies mainly depends on CDR sequence diversity. In the case of a na\u00efve library, the library diversity comes from not only the sequence diversity, but also from light and heavy chain rearrangement. Of note, the random heavy and light chain rearrangement is a process highly resembling chain shuffling, which is a routine strategy for in vitro antibody affinity maturation. This may explain why antibodies with very high affinity were isolated from na\u00efve phage libraries, even when the libraries were constructed from germline sequences with no or very limited somatic hypermutations. While it was expected that identification of library size is a key factor that determines the affinity, a correlation with either library type or library generation was not observed (data not shown). One reason is that, except for a few early libraries, the library size difference among three generations of phage libraries is minimal. Also, the advancements of three generations of phage libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of",

This has, for example, been used to generate minimalistic antibody libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids in the randomized CDR region [19,20]. Semi-synthetic libraries with different combinations of synthetically and naturally host derived diversity have also been created. \n\nUnlike the immunized and na\u00efve libraries, the synthetic and semisynthetic libraries can be made using only one or few of the antibody framework repertoires. This reduces the contribution to diversity from the interface residues bordering the CDRs. It has, however, been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that some variable (V) segments are much more commonly used in functional antibodies than others. Furthermore there are great differences in the stability and suitability for bacterial expression between different frameworks [21,22]. \n\nFollowing the creation of large libraries of recombinant antibodies, systems, which allow sorting of the libraries, need to be introduced and here display of the recombinant antibodies on the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage (phage) have played a pioneering role. The application known as \"phage display\" was first developed by G.P Smith in 1985 [23]. In phage display a foreign protein is expressed in fusion with one of the phage capsid proteins by cloning the foreign DNA sequence into the same reading frame as the gene of the chosen capsid protein. The major strength of phage display is the physical coupling between the phenotype (the fusion protein) and the genotype (the DNA inside the virion encoding the fusion protein). This coupling allows for high throughput selection of desirable properties of the fusion protein from libraries with billions of variants. There are two very important aspects of phage display selection of recombinant antibodies, namely the nature and quality of the material containing the antigen selected against, and perhaps more overlooked the quality and design of the displayed antibody library itself.",

            "text": "libraries to be beneficial is the theoretical diversity of the library. As the repertoire is largely na\u00efve, the potential combinations generated by synthetic methods are able to rival the process carried out naturally with the large library size. However, the sheer size of the library diversity makes it difficult to re-culture without eventual loss of diversity. Even so, the antibodies enriched from synthetic libraries showed comparable affinities to those derived naturally [32]. Another major bottleneck associated with the use of synthetic libraries is the cost of generating a synthetic library. Even so, the turn of events in genetic engineering over the past few years has seen the cost for oligonucleotide synthesis reduced tremendously. Therefore, now it is a plausible solution for most laboratories to generate their own version of a synthetic antibody library.\n\nA key subset of synthetic libraries is the production of semi-synthetic libraries. The first semisynthetic library was reported in 1992, in which rearrangement of 49 human VH gene segments with five to eight residues of synthetic CDR was carried out to yield a semi-synthetic singlechain fragment variable (scFv) library [33]. The key difference between semi-and fully synthetic libraries is the source of the diversity. In semi-synthetic libraries, the diversity is largely obtained from natural sources whereby the genes encoding the CDR are isolated. These CDR genes are then inserted to a fixed framework sequence, which encodes the antibody backbone [27,34]. The diversity is still natural, taking advantage of the maturation processes of antibodies in vivo. The application of synthetic antibodies to develop antibodies for diagnostic applications has allowed the generation of antibodies against various antigens of diagnostic value. This is evident with approximately three billion clones in the ETH-2-Gold library that were used against a wide range of recombinant antigens, such as extracellular glycoprotein of tenascin-C (TNC) [35]. Other versions have been reported such as the Tomlinson I library with 18 amino acid side-chain diversity on the CDR, and the Griffin library [36] was constructed by using six diverse synthetic CDR3 regions [37]. The main difference between Tomlinson I and J libraries is the choice of randomization used before clone into pIT2 phagemid system. The Tomlinson I library uses the DVT",

            "text": "Once display of a parent protein has been demonstrated, it is possible to build display libraries of 10 6 -10 11 variants from which variants having a desired binding property can be selected. In contrast, other screening methods such as chemical library or cell based screening allow testing of hundreds or thousands of synthetic compounds, or tens of thousands of plated colonies. In fact, 10 10 variants in a phage display library is actually a small part of the available theoretical sequence space. That is, the first set of binders to an antigen of interest can be subsequently diversified, retaining the sequence features that initially caused binding. This iterative variegation was used successfully to create high-affinity protease inhibitors of human plasmin, plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and it has become a common strategy in affinity maturation of drug candidates identified by phage display. 4,5 hage display was first described in 1985 and used to display short peptide fragments, 6 and the first patent was filed in 1991 (US5223409). 7 Since then, phage display has proven to be a reliable method for the generation of peptides with potential therapeutic or diagnostic utility. 8 Phage display of single-chain V-domain antibody fragments (scFv) was reported in 1990, along with selective recovery of the phage on the basis of antigen binding. 9 It has since become a major discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). 10 More recently described antibody libraries have displayed Fab fragments on the phage protein, which can be readily reformatted to full-length IgG antibodies, usually without loss of binding function. 11,12 ources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest.",

            "text": "Four types of antibody libraries can be distinguished with respect to the source of library sequences: Immune, na\u00efve, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries (Figure 2). While the first two are based entirely on naturally occurring sequence diversity, synthetic libraries are diversified according to design. Semi-synthetic libraries combine natural diversity for certain aspects of the library with in silico design. Although the combinatorial aspect is most prominent in semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries, na\u00efve and immune libraries also feature certain combinatorial aspects, e.g. the random pairing of heavy and light chains. For representative examples of different phage display libraries please refer to Table 1. \n\nGeneration of large functional libraries is limited by transformation/transfection efficiency and the occurrence of frame shift mutants leading to non functional proteins. The cloning of large antibody libraries is therefore technically challenging, laborious and time consuming. The principle of in vivo recombination of the light and heavy chain gene of an antibody was first described by the group of Greg Winter as a means to increase library size [65]. A Cre/loxP two vector system was used, with a donor plasmid vector encoding the heavy chain and an acceptor fd phage vector encoding the light chain. Both heavy as well as light chain gene are flanked by loxP sites leading to a site-specific recombination in vivo. By-passing the limitation of transformation efficiency with infection, this system allows the generation of very large libraries. Griffiths and coworkers used this system to generate a phage display library of 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . Sblattero and Bradbury used a modified version where both the heavy and light chain V-genes were located on the same phagemid separated by a loxP site. Starting out with a relatively small initial library with a size of 7 \u00d7 10 7 they were able to generate a library of 3 \u00d7 10 11 in vivo by site-specific recombination [66]. Another important aspect is functional library size, which is limited by the occurrence of deletion mutants caused by frameshifts or stop codons introduced during diversification. Tremendous progress has been made by construction of vector systems comprising a positive selection for protein integrity.",

            "text": "Phage display has been introduced as an efficient alternative to hybridoma technology for the generation of therapeutically relevant antibodies. Antibody phage display (APD) provides the opportunity to design and construct large libraries of antibody fragments. The expression of antibodies on the surface of phage particles represents a powerful platform for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with desired binding characteristics that can serve for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of various disorders especially infectious diseases [35]. \n\nAccording to the source of antibody-encoding sequences, phage antibody libraries (PALs) are divided into two main types of natural and synthetic libraries. Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors. This type of antibody library has been constructed from different species including human, non-human primates, mouse, chicken, sheep, camel, and cattle. Immune libraries are considered as the most useful type of PALs for infectious diseases. They are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36,37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs).",

The latter are produced by cloning the antibody genes from immunised animals (e.g. [7][8][9]) or diseased or vaccinated humans [10,11] and are directed towards a single or limited number of antigens. Na\u00efve phage display libraries are produced from the natural antibody repertoire of donors. Alternatively, phage display libraries can be produced using a relatively small diversity of natural antibody sequences whose diversity is increased through mutating one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (semi-synthetic libraries). Libraries can also be based on a single or very low number of \"scaffold\" sequences with introduced diversity in the CDRs (synthetic libraries). Immune libraries require Fig. 1 Representations of the different structures of antibodies and antibody fragments for phage display. The multidomain structure of conventional IgG and heavy chain antibody (camelid and shark) (a). Antibody fragments can be displayed on phage as Fabs, scFvs or nanobodies (V H Hs or V NAR , derived from camelid or shark, respectively). The synthetic scFab-Fc dimer is also shown (b). V variable domain, C constant domain, H heavy chain, L light chain immunisation and library cloning for each antigen but small repertoire libraries (~ 10 6 ) usually facilitate the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [7][8][9]). On the other hand, na\u00efve or synthetic/semi-synthetic libraries (collectively known as single-pot libraries) can be used against any antigen but are required to have very high diversity (typically > 10 10 ) to allow the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [12][13][14][15][16]). \n\nIn terms of antibody formats, Fabs consist of the VH-CH1 and VL-CL chains, one of which is fused to the pIII protein [17]. In phage display systems these two chains are usually expressed separately and assemble into the Fab format within the periplasm of the bacteria via a disulphide bond linkage.",

An antibody library, a large collection of diverse, pre-constructed antibodies, can be rapidly screened using in vitro display technologies such as phage display. One of the keys to successful in vitro antibody discovery is the quality of the library diversity. Antibody diversity can be obtained either from natural B-cell sources or by the synthetic methods that combinatorially generate random nucleotide sequences. While the functionality of a natural antibody library depends largely upon the library size, various other factors can affect the quality of a synthetic antibody library, making the design and construction of synthetic antibody libraries complicated and challenging. In this review, we present various library designs and diversification methods for synthetic antibody library. From simple degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis to trinucleotide synthesis to physicochemically optimized library design, the synthetic approach is evolving beyond the simple emulation of natural antibodies, into a highly sophisticated method that is capable of producing high quality antibodies suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic, and other demanding applications.

            "text": "However, this is an inaccurate measure at best, plagued by uncertainties in colony counting and the underlying genetic diversity, which can often be significantly less than the number of transformants 3,22,23 . Diversity correlates with library functionality: the probability of discovering an antibody in the library with desired activity (e.g., affinity, functional activity, or therapeutic efficacy). In the case of antibody libraries, other desirable key features are \"developability properties\": stability and resistance to aggregation in solution, thermodynamic stability, and low self-interaction, among others. Therefore, scientists strive to make antibody libraries as large as possible by performing numerous transformations or, less commonly, applying sitespecific recombination approaches 3,4,24 . However, unless the underlying genetic diversity is sufficiently large, generating more transformants will not necessarily increase library functionality. This is less of a problem for synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries, in which the theoretical diversity far exceeds the number of transformants that can be routinely obtained. For example, the theoretical diversity of the HuCAL Gold library 8 was estimated to be 10 60 , but the number of transformants, 10 10 , was the limiting factor. Although the assessment of genetic diversity is clearly an improvement over counting colonies, functional diversity is a more valuable measure, particularly in the case of synthetic libraries in which degenerate oligonucleotides may encode poorly folding, or polyreactive, antibodies, resulting in a larger chemical space that does not necessarily directly correlates with protein functionality. \n\nFor natural naive libraries, the general paradigm has been to increase the natural source of B-cell diversity by increasing the number of donors 23,25,26 . The question remains as to whether increasing the number of donors actually leads to improved antibody diversity and library functionality. \n\nIn recent papers examining library diversity with nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), estimated genetic diversity was far lower than anticipated 22,23,26,27 . This may be a consequence of cloning or PCR inefficiencies, inherently restricted underlying diversity (e.g., insufficient numbers of B cells or libraries skewed by excesses of memory or plasma cells), or problems with harvesting the natural diversity, by failing to collect and reproduce the entirety of the diversity present in the starting material.",

            "text": "We describe here a novel, cost-effective and accelerated approach to therapeutic antibody discovery, that couples de novo human antibodies derived in silico, which we refer to as \"humanoid antibodies\", with high-throughput screening technologies. We have developed the antibody-GAN, a new in silico engineering approach to designing a novel class of diverse antibody therapeutics that mimic somatically hypermutated human repertoire response. The platform allows antibody biasing towards desirable developability attributes, such as suitability for common protein manufacturing processes, high stability during long-term storage conditions, low viscosity for injectability at high concentration and long elimination half-lives to reduce dosing frequency [3]. Here, we employed the antibody-GAN to design and construct a 1 billion theoretical diversity phage Fab display library. This library is in process of expanding to over 50 billion theoretical diversity by 2024. The first validation campaign described herein was conducted with the intent to discover antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and demonstrate library utility. Phage display methodology has proven to be a robust, and efficient platform to discover and develop human therapeutic antibodies [15]. Our antibody-GAN generated phage library is comprised of 25 sublibraries, five heavy chain germlines paired combinatorially with five variable chain (4 kappa and 1 lambda) germlines. Fv sequence diversity encompasses both framework and CDR regions, which drives affinity, efficacy, and developability [3]. Most synthetic libraries focus only on CDR diversity [16]. Due to the sensitive balance between affinity, efficacy, and developability, it is likely advantageous to consider the entire Fv sequence space when engineering the optimal therapeutic candidate. Since it is known that the framework residues can impact both developability and binding [19,21]. We, therefore, chose to engineer this degree of diversity when designing J.HAL \u00ae . Both in vitro and in vivo antibody discovery methodologies have limitations whether it is library diversity or lack of an appropriate immune response. We do not know how J.HAL \u00ae will compare and perform against any particular methodology or antigen.",

            "text": "Target-specific antibodies can be rapidly isolated from a large antibody library by in vitro display technologies, such as phage or yeast display. The size and quality of the antibody library is a major determinant of the success of in vitro antibody generation, and many different strategies have been employed to design and construct large, highly functional antibody libraries [1]. While the size of an antibody library is mostly determined by the transformation efficiency of bacteria or yeast, multiple different factors can influence the functionality of a library and thus need to be considered in the library design. One important factor in library design is the source and nature of the sequence diversity, which can originate from natural (animal B-cells), synthetic, or semi-synthetic sources. \n\nAntibody libraries from natural sources consist of antibody clones with variable regions that are the end product of V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation of germline immunoglobulin genes, all of which are presumably optimized through the evolutionary history of adaptive immunity. Antibodies isolated from a natural antibody library are thus generally considered more nature-like than those from a synthetic antibody library, whose diversity typically is generated by random combinatorial events. On the other hand, the greater heterogeneity of the framework regions among the clones of natural antibody libraries may result in more uneven propagation of the clones during the amplification phase of biopanning. Also, somatic hypermutations, especially in the framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that can elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response when the antibody is used as a therapeutic agent. \n\nSynthetic antibody libraries usually have one or a small number of framework sequences, upon which artificially designed and synthesized CDR sequences are grafted. The CDR diversity is mostly generated by concatenating random nucleotides [2][3][4] or trinucleotide units [5][6][7]. Various CDR design strategies have been employed to emulate natural CDRs. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences to the library.",

Indeed, antibodies obtained from this library had a proportion of T-cell epitopes no higher than that of naturally occurring antibodies. An antibody against ICAM-1 was isolated from this library and shown to have potent anti-myeloma activity in vivo (30). \n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation. Hoet et al. at Dyax Corp reported the isolation of very high-affinity antibodies through synthetic diversity introduced into the key antigen-contact sites of CDR1 and CDR2 within the heavy chain in combination with naturally occurring diversity in the heavy chain CDR3 and light chains from donors with autoimmune diseases (31). Their human antibody phage display libraries have produced multiple drug candidates currently in different phases of clinical development.",

            "text": "Antibodies represent the fastest-growing segment of all the therapeutic proteins in the biotechnology industry. 1 This remarkable progress is due in part to the exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibodies, compounded with their stability, solubility, clinical tolerability and relatively straightforward manufacturing process compared to other biologics. Yet, the overall process of bringing antibodies from the early discovery phase into the market is a long and expensive one, with the investment increasing exponentially as the potential antibody-based drug progresses from discovery to preclinical development to clinical trials and finally reaches the market. \n\nOver decades, as therapeutic antibodies either moved through the process required for commercialization 2 or failed to perform in preclinical development and clinical trials, it has become clear that many of the properties that account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials, collectively called developability, 3,4 are encoded in the primary amino acid sequence of the antibody. This implies that the developability profile of an antibody can be engineered in the early discovery phase, where the costs of development are still relatively modest. Hence, there is substantial interest in, and demand for, the design and implementation of more robust and efficient discovery platforms capable of generating antibody sequences with the optimal developability profile in the earliest stages of development. \n\nPhage display has served as a key enabling technology for therapeutic antibody discovery. 5 This technology platform, which was developed in the late 1980s and perfected during the past three decades, [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] rests on the principle that more diverse, functional and larger libraries produce more diverse, specific and higher affinity antibodies. To generate larger and more diverse antibody libraries, three main approaches have been described in the literature, including: 1) na\u00efve libraries composed of natural diversity; 12 2) libraries based on rational design and synthesis of selected scaffolds; 9,11,14 and 3) semisynthetic libraries, which combine synthetic and natural fragments. 10 irst-generation phage display antibody libraries were na\u00efve. 12 Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library.",

            "text": "They found that antibodies directly discovered by phage display or engineered at some point by phage biopanning exhibit significant developability risks' properties compared to than those derived from immunized mice. Further investigations found that phage display derived therapeutic antibodies have higher self-interaction and poly-reactivity due to the higher percentage of aliphatic residues in their CDRs compared to the non-phage derived antibodies (112). \n\nAdditionally, antibodies selected form phage display libraries are not glycosylated, because they are produced in E. coli, as a result, some candidates when glycosylation occur during mammalian cells expression; their binding, biodistribution, or pharmacokinetics might be negatively impacted (113)(114)(115)(116). Therefore, using eukaryotic display platforms like yeast and mammalian display would be beneficial. For instance, in addition to their ability to produce glycosylated proteins, yeast and mammalian antibody libraries can be constructed to display fulllength antibodies as well as antibody fragments, such as scFvs and fragment antigen-binding region (Fabs) (117)(118)(119)(120)(121)(122)(123)(124)(125)(126), allowing the isolation of high affinity antibodies with definitive biological characteristics (122,123). For example, Parthiban et al. has developed mammalian libraries that display around 10 million clones in IgG-format on the surface of HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (127). These libraries can act as a quality filter for different antibody developability aspects, and to provide a very early insight into developability problems, such as aggregation and cross-reactivity. Each display system has its advantages and disadvantages, however, determining those are beyond the intended scope of this review, which is about the most commonly used type of antibody display, the phage display. Therefore, it is vital to generate phage libraries that allow for the isolation of highly specific and diverse mAbs with high affinity against diverse antigens with optimal developability potential (128)(129)(130).",

            "text": "Universal antibody phage display libraries, typically consisting of over ten billion unique sequences, have become a valuable source for discovery of mAbs against any types of targets. According to the source of diversity, antibody phage libraries can be divided into natural, fully synthetic, and semisynthetic libraries ( Figure 1). In a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose. The quality of the synthetic DNA that are used to create CDR diversity plays a pivotal role in determining the functional size of a synthetic library. By using mono-or trinucleotide phosphoramidites (TRIM technology) as building blocks, 84,85 diversified CDRs can be synthesized in a high-throughput manner, such as array-based oligonucleotide synthesis and Slonomics. 86,87 In the TRIM technology, each amino acid is encoded by a defined codon. Therefore, amino acid distribution at the desired position can be precisely defined. Moreover, because the codon for each amino acid is selected for optimal antibody expression, the functional library size is increased. In the natural antibody repertoire, the diversity of CDRs, except CDRH3, is a collection of defined sequences that exhibit canonical structures. Compared with the traditional column-based DNA synthesis approaches in which one single gene is produced per column, the high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies allow parallel synthesis of a large number of predetermined sequences in the same footprint on a silicon-based chip. 88,89 This enables not only removal of liability motifs that impact developability, but also precise mimic of the",

            "text": "Other examples are shown in Table 2, as well as the most advanced alternative scaffolds, and a recent review provides a comprehensive overview of phage-derived mAbs in clinical development [25]. Phage display is comparable to immunization methodologies with regards to the generation of high affinity binders, but can be used to isolate antibodies or other binder types to targets not easily found via hybridoma or single B-cell screening technologies, such as toxins and self-antigens. \n\nAs with small molecules, the discovery and development of novel biologics often begin with the screening of large libraries in which millions to billions of antibody (or antibody fragment) sequences are represented. When these libraries are diverse, with uniform representation among variants, and are free of liability motifs that can lead to poor pharmacokinetics or developability issues, hundreds of promising candidates can be found and carried forward for further characterization and optimization. \n\nFor therapeutic antibody discovery, antibody fragments containing the VH and VL regions (as scFv or Fab fragments) from na\u00efve or synthetic repertoires or VHH fragments representing synthetic [26], na\u00efve [27] or immune repertoires [5,28], respectively, have been the choice for display given the large size of an intact immunoglobulin molecule, and various examples are provided below. Further examples of each have been extensively reviewed in several recent publications [25,[29][30][31]. The derivation of antibody libraries aims at the generation of different types of repertoires ranging from na\u00efve repertoires from healthy volunteers, target-specific repertoires obtained from immunizing animals or vaccinated humans, as well as immune repertoires from disease conditions, to semisynthetic and designed fully synthetic libraries that can also encompass repertoires constructed to direct antibodies to specific target types, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [32], and examples of these various repertoire libraries are described, as follows. \n\nRepertoires of antibodies from nonimmunized donors have been considered a source from which it is possible to isolate highly specific antibodies to a wide range of antigens whereby heavy and light chains are randomly combined, and, due to the heavy and light chain rearrangement, the library diversity is dramatically increased beyond the natural heavy and light chain pairing.",

            "text": "Today, a wide variety of antibody phage display libraries exist, with the antibodies displayed either as Fabs, scFvs (single-chain variable fragments) or sdAbs (single-domain antibodies) in fusion with typically the gene III coat protein (6,7) (Fig. 1). The small size and solubility of the phage particle (up to 10 13 particles/ml) has allowed repertoire sizes of up to 10 11-12 to be efficiently displayed and manipulated, which improves the likelihood of finding suitable antibodies (8). These antibody sequences can be obtained from natural sources (animal or human) or synthetically constructed [usually a mix of pre-defined framework regions (FRs) with randomized sequences in the CDRs] and isolation of specific sequences is carried out by repeated enrichment against the target of interest. \n\nThe defining attribute of all phage display libraries is the physical linking of antibody phenotype (specificity and affinity) with genotype (sequence) via the phage particle-this allows for in vitro selection on immobilized antigen or whole cells (Fig. 2). As this method by-passes the immune system, the usual factors that influence antibody development and limit diversity based on those that can be isolated in animals are not applicable. As such, antibodies can be isolated against targets that have low immunogenicity in animals (nonproteinaceous antigens), to regions of a protein not usually targeted due to the presence of immunodominant epitopes elsewhere, or to hydrophobic targets that are challenging for in vivo manipulation (9)(10)(11). As such, phage display offers high potential for discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies that cannot be generated naturally through in vivo immunization or infection. Furthermore, the ability to display synthetic repertoires devoid of any negative selection has made this technique a key method for the generation of potent fully human antibody therapeutics against self-antigens (12). Nixon et al. provide an in-depth review of the clinical development of such drugs (13). Polyclonal phage expressing recombinant antibodies on their surface is applied to target antigen presented as either immobilized on a magnetic bead, polystyrene surface or on the surface of a whole cell.",

We describe the construction of a high-quality phage display library comprising\u00a05\u2009\u00d7\u200910 9 human antibodies by applying an efficient B cell extraction protocol from a single donor and a targeted V-gene amplification strategy favoring\u00a0specific antibody families for their improved developability profiles. Each step of the library generation process\u00a0was followed and validated by next generation sequencing to\u00a0monitor the library quality and diversity. The functionality of the library was tested using several therapeutically relevant targets for which a vast number of different antibodies with desired biophysical properties were obtained. Here, the authors construct and validate an in vitro antibody library from a single, healthy donor. They demonstrate the functionality of the library using several therapeutically relevant targets and were able to obtain many different antibodies with the desired biophysical properties.",

A conclusion regarding the validity of the above-mentioned credo is thus difficult to draw with the limited amount of data available today. A recent review by Getts et al., discusses in depth this trend towards human antibodies with respect to immunogenicity and safety aspects [4]. \n\nIn order to characterize a given antibody library, three main aspects have to be considered: the display method, the antibody fragment used as scaffold and the source of the sequence diversity. This review gives an introduction into the field with a focus on antibody-based phage display libraries for the generation of therapeutic antibodies, many of them developed in an industrial setting. To put everything into context, it will briefly describe the display methods used most frequently and touch on different antibody formats currently in use for display and selection.",

            "text": "In the human immune system, naive B cells targeting selfantigens are deleted by negative selection and immunization in a different host is therefore required to generate specific antibodies against human targets. However, the resultant antibodies, even after humanization by replacement of constant regions or of FRs with human equivalents, are usually more immunogenic than a human-derived antibody (15). While this can result in increased toxicity, the primary concern is the potential for reduced clinical efficacy of the therapy which can occur with development of a humoral immune response against the antibody. \n\nFor self-antigens, such as tumour cell markers, phage display is an ideal technique for the generation of fully human antibodies due to the absence of tolerance mechanisms. Semi-synthetic or synthetic libraries, whose sequences have not been negatively selected for any antigen, are usually the first choice. An additional advantage of these libraries is that design features can be incorporated to allow facile affinity maturation, such as CDRs flanked by restriction sites for easy replacement or appropriate consensus primers for targeting of specific CDRs for directed mutagenesis (16). Several fully human synthetic library-derived mAbs have been approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration or completed clinical trials. The first of these was adalimumab, an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody developed by Cambridge Antibody Technologies for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis and Crohn's disease (17,18). Subsequently, other antibodies were developed for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease such as necitumumab (non-small cell lung cancer), ramucirumab (gastrointestinal cancers) and belimumab (systemic lupus erythematosus) (12,19,20). Many others are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years (21,22). As mAbs gain popularity as a form of alternative drug therapy, the use of phage displayed antibody libraries has also gained a reputation as the premier technology for antibody discovery. \n\nSemi-synthetic libraries, which were the first to be made, typically consist of FRs sourced from naturally occurring antibodies and CDR regions synthesized from degenerate oligonucleotides (23,24).",

Fully synthetic libraries are those that display completely synthetically constructed complementary determining regions (CDRs) on known antibody frameworks, or synthetically constructed peptides, allowing for the generation of libraries with huge, randomised diversity [45,46]. These genotype-linked molecules can be screened through affinity enrichment, in a process called biopanning (see Figure 4), where molecules that bind to a target of interest are isolated. There is a range of different labelled approaches (see Table 2) that are used for different purposes. DNA-encoded chemical libraries [36] have enabled expansion of the screening repertoire for up to 10 8 molecules, where compounds are chemically conjugated to DNA sequences that indicate their chemistry. Cell-free display techniques such as mRNA display allow for the production of libraries, with some of the largest degrees of genetic variation-reportedly above 10 12 variants-because they can employ PCR-based approaches for generation of library variation [47]. Some techniques such as the protocol designed by Jones et al. (2016) have also performed phage display on cell-presented antigens (such as membrane-bound receptors) [48]. In this system, panning occurs on cells in solution, where the target is presented in its native state, including post-translational modifications.",

            "text": "The immune repertoire was sourced from lymph nodes from seven different donors, peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine different donors, spleen from one donor, and tonsil RNA from five donors. All six CDRs from donor repertoires were amplified and reassembled into a single light (DP-L3) and heavy chain (VH3-23) framework that is well-presented in the human repertoire and well-expressed in host cells [47]. This approach circumvents loss in diversity due to low expression or the display level of certain germline genes. The library was validated against a range of haptens, peptides, carbohydrates, and proteins and has successfully isolated antibody clones with subnanomolar affinities; in fact, at least five mAbs generated using the n-CoDer TM library have entered clinical trials. The semisynthetic strategy has been refined further by grafting naturally occurring CDRs from human antibodies into frameworks based on well-behaved clinical antibodies, referred to as a Generation Three design [48], in order to address the identification of highly developable therapeutic antibodies directly from the library, CDR-H3 sequences were amplified directly from B cells, while the remaining CDRs were sourced from a large next-generation sequencing dataset and all sequence liabilities eliminated. The resulting scFv library is 9 \u00d7 10 9 in size with the CDR diversity incorporated into 4 VH frameworks, 3 V\u03ba frameworks, and 1 V\u03bb framework [48]. In addition, two in vitro display platforms, phage and yeast display, were implemented to isolate diverse antibodies to clinically relevant protein targets, yielding affinities down to the subnanomolar and picomolar range demonstrating that this approach has the potential to considerably reduce discovery timelines. \n\nIn the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression.",

            "text": "Although the first use of phage display focused on peptides, antibody libraries have been arguably the most successful use of this technology and have led to the discovery of antibodies with affinities comparable to those obtained by hybridoma technology. 9,27 In fact, alongside with the development of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology 28 and the isolation and cloning of antibody genes to enable expression of antibody fragments in bacteria, 29,30 the generation of antibody libraries by phage display can be considered as one of the groundbreaking methods for the antibody discovery. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed from natural sources by isolating the B cells of a source animal that has been immunized with the target antigen and using the isolated antibody genes to create the antibody library. 31 These kind of libraries have a strong bias toward the antigen, and even a modest-sized library can be sufficient to isolate specific binders. However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. 32 Most of these libraries are produced from mouse, 33\u221237 but also other animals, such as chicken, 38,39 rabbit, 32,40 sheep, 41 monkey, 42 camel, 43 and shark, 44 have been used. Additionally, immunized human libraries have been made using blood from patients naturally infected with viruses or parasites. 5,45 n the other hand, nai \u0308ve antibody libraries can be constructed completely in vitro resulting in nonimmunized, 46 synthetic, 47 or semisynthetic libraries. 48 The use of synthetic repertoires bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences. 49 Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). 9 Synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce diversity into the CDRs.",

This technology was initially developed by George Smith in the mid-1980s and applied by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter to antibody engineering at the beginning of 1990s. Here, we compare nine phage display antibody libraries published in the last decade, which represent the state of the art in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies using phage display. We first discuss the quality of the libraries and the diverse types of antibody repertoires used as substrates to build the libraries, i.e., na\u00efve, synthetic, and semisynthetic. Second, we review the performance of the libraries in terms of the number of positive clones per panning, hit rate, affinity, and developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges pertaining to phage display platforms and related display technologies.",

            "text": "In the early days of antibody phage display, the initial focus was on generating large diverse repertoires (>10 10 transformants) to identify high affinity functional binders, which was subsequently followed by addressing aspects of sequence liabilities via synthetic approaches to resolve developability and expression challenges that occurred with some naturally occurring antibody sequences and errors introduced by initial synthetic approaches, as well as removal of T cell epitopes, for example, by the selection of frameworks that exhibited optimal stability and expression. These early synthetic libraries focused on using selected frameworks restricting diversity to the CDRs [49,50], but were unable to robustly generate high affinity antibodies against a broad range of protein targets. Thus, as well as efforts to expand the diversity further in all the CDR loops, the range of well-behaved frameworks was increased to generate content that better reflected the natural repertoire observed in humans [24,51]. Modular design features enabling facile engineering, such as for affinity maturation, were incorporated [46] along with a focus on antibody sequences (and therefore structure) that impacted on performance and function. \n\nOne avenue of refining synthetic library design has been to take a minimalist strategy and decrease randomization by using a single framework with a binary code to diversify the CDR-H3. In one such study, Tyr and Ser were selected as these have been found to be highly abundant in antibody binding sites [52]. The initial library randomized only the VH CDR positions by binary code [53] and then diversity expanded incrementally to the VL CDR positions, as well as nonparatope residues that may impact on CDR conformation and structure. Improvements in affinity (to single digit nanomolar) were observed for the model soluble antigen used (VEGF) where the tyrosine side chains were sufficient to mediate the majority of antigen interactions. However, a glycine residue in the CDR-H3 was determined to be critical for the paratope conformation enabling high affinity binding.",

At least .1 L of blood samples might be consumed in order to obtain ~10 9 individual clones per library for the naive library. 4 This means that the semisynthetic or synthetic library had better CDR3 diversity and better utility than the naturally occurring naive VHH or V-NAR libraries without immunization of animal or collection of large volume of blood samples. Thus, this may be a promising path toward obtaining a limitless source of nanobodies against a variety of antigens without immunization of animals. \n\nIndependent of the strategies to construct libraries, the established libraries further need to be displayed on different biological carries, including phages, bacteria, yeasts, and ribosomes, to facilitate screening and panning for a given antigen-specific nanobody. Retrieval of nanobodies from the libraries by phage display or any other selection protocols described earlier, including bacterial display, yeast display, intracellular two-hybrid selection, and ribosome display, has been well documented. 1 By a variety of standard biopanning strategies, these libraries are preciously hidden treasure with great molecular diversity and could be utilized to fish out the nanobody binders with desired properties to various antigens of interest.",

            "text": "multidrug-resistant organisms has spurred the need to develop alternate strategies to the standard antibiotics therapy regime. One such strategy is the use of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can function both in a prophylactic and therapeutic manner [1]. The breadth of mAb application in this area has seen a rapid increase of mAb trials over the past decade for a wide range of pathologies including infectious diseases [2]. The development of antibody display technologies such as phage display [3][4][5], yeast display [6], mRNA display [7], ribosome display [8], bacterial display [9][10][11] and mammalian cell surface display [12] have aided the rapid development of new mAbs. The basic principle of these in vitro selection technologies stems from the physical link between phenotype (displayed antibody construct) and genotype (antibody genes) tethered to the carrier particle [13]. Even with the availability of different display methods, phage display is widely regarded as the preferred approach for antibody display.\n\nThe general requirement for a successful mAb selection process is the existence of a diverse combinatorial repertoire of antibody genes from which to select. This collection of antibody genes is commonly referred to as an antibody library [14]. Antibody libraries can be distinguished by the source of antibody genes used for display. This ranges from na\u00efve (healthy individuals), immune (infected or immunized individuals), synthetic (chemically synthesized) and semi-synthetic (a mixture of natural immune and chemically synthesized genes) libraries [14][15][16]. The development of human antibody libraries requires B-cells obtained from human donors which sometimes represents a bottleneck due to the specific characteristics of the samples needed such as source of the B-cells, and the strict regulation in terms of human biological samples usage in research. Apart from humans, animals are also a valuable source of B-cells for antibody library generation. In the context of infectious diseases, immune libraries are very attractive options as they are designed to mirror the immune response of an infected individual or immunized animal, reflecting the biased repertoire of antibody genes specific to that infection. This is only true in the case where the B-cells can elicit an immune response to the infection. Therefore, the nature of the immune response to",

            "text": "Mammalian display technology relies on delivering transgene repertoires into a complex eukaryotic cell background in a manner that simultaneously preserves the genotype-phenotype linkage and achieves an efficiency sufficient for creating large libraries. Once suitable libraries have been constructed, the encoded proteins must be displayed on the cell surface to facilitate the enrichment of clones based on desired molecular properties (their phenotype). This \"selection\" or enrichment process is fundamental to all display technologies and, in conjunction with the input diversity and the screening experiment design, determines the output quality. Following selection, it is necessary to recover the genes of interest to identify and characterise hits. \n\nMammalian display has been effectively combined with other display methods for antibody discovery and optimisation (Figure 2). For example, entire outputs from phage display can be converted into a mammalian display library, combining multi-parametric FACS-based selection in the final drug format via mammalian display (50,56,98). Situating mammalian display downstream of technologies that generate diverse repertoires of antibody binders maximises the available library size and enables deep mining of focused libraries, for example, from na\u00efve (non-immune) sources. The diversity from immune repertoires can be more readily covered directly in the mammalian display system from immunised animals (99) and human immune sources (100). Direct use of fully synthetic library designs has also been reported (50) (Figure 2). This concept has been applied to a semi-synthetic and modular scFv phage library of developable antibody scaffolds that can be transferred to mammalian display for screening in final format [(https://fjbio.com/services/ explorer-library, date accessed: 22nd of July 2024)]. Mammalian display technology can be applied beyond the antibody discovery field and has empirically validated capability for engineering multiple protein types and biologics modalities (Figure 3).",

Later studies showed that, by generating larger na\u00efve libraries with library size of 10 10 -10 12 , antibodies with low-to sub-nanomolar affinity can be directly isolated. 90,91,93,[114][115][116][117][118] Of note, the large na\u00efve library and related phage display technology developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology has led to approval of six mAbs: adalimumab, 119 belimumab, 120 moxetumomab pasudotox, 121,122 raxibacumab, 123 emapalumab, 124 and tralokinumab. 125 Another example is the n-CoDeR library in which heavy and light chain CDR segments were separately amplified by using primers specific to VH3-23 and VL1-47 germlines. The six CDRs were then reassembled in a single light and heavy chain framework that is well-presented in human repertoire and wellexpressed in bacterial host cells. 94 This strategy overcomes the drawback with conventional na\u00efve antibody phage libraries in which part of the diversity might be lost due to low expression and/or display level of certain germline genes in prokaryotic system. The n-CoDeR library was used to discover five mAbs and their derivatives that entered clinical trials. [126][127][128][129][130] In our experience, high hit rate (>90%) can be readily achieved and antibodies with high affinity (low nanomolar) can be routinely isolated from a large na\u00efve library (library size = 10 12 ) constructed in-house. Depending on the target, 10-20% of total sequences screened are unique.\n\nTaken together, first-generation phage libraries demonstrated that antibody discovery can be performed completely in vitro and antibodies with high affinity and sequence diversity can be isolated directly from phage libraries.",

One set of the synthetic library diversity used the trimer oligo technology [30] to ensure minimal posttranslational risks and minimize unintended presence of stop codons [22]. This library was designed to be as simple as possible encompassing the codons for all protein residues (except for those corresponding to M, N, C, and stop codon) that were distributed across CDR3 regions found between the f lanking motifs of YYCA and FDYW of the human heavy variable subfamily IGHV3-23 (IMGT). The library design diversity for the CDR3 length of 10-17 residues was between 1.88 \u00d7 10 12 and 1.88 \u00d7 10 19 . The synthetic library was complemented by the additional use of the Gibson technology to improve the efficiency of NNM (where N = A/C/G/T and M = A/C) mutagenesis coding to most residues within the CDR3 regions. The design diversity for these CDR3 length of 10-17 residues libraries was between 2.21 \u00d7 10 11 and 2.21 \u00d7 10 17 . The transformation efficiencies for each library and each CDR3 length ranged from 5 \u00d7 10 8 to 2 \u00d7 10 9 . By combining the two synthetic phage library designs, we created a phage display library of 2 \u00d7 10 10 size. NGS analyses on >1 million pooled CDR3 sequences confirmed >95% accuracy of the mutational design without any enrichment of individual sequences.",

The traditional approach of generating monoclonal antibody (mAb) candidates for developable biotherapeutics from either naturally sourced (immunized or na\u00efve) or synthetic antibodies is resource-intensive and lacks the ability to produce enough valuable candidates that maintain disease relevance. Although naturally sourced antibodies show high levels of target affinity and stability, they have limited ranges in antigen recognition, with hit identification often capturing at most several candidates. The synthetic antibody approach can yield more epitope diversity among its candidates, but they tend to be less stable and have lower affinity values when compared with naturally sourced antibodies. Despite these challenges, the TavoSelect VHO platform's creative biopanning, NGS analysis, and specific screening methodologies can deliver diverse epitopes in less time with less resources. We used the sequence of the human VH3-23 with a binary residue located in framework 1 that does not alter conformation to design the VHOs. As a result, most hits behaved well throughout the discovery process contrasting previous reports that mentioned or showed developability challenges with human heavy variable domain antibodies [32][33][34][35]. We are intrigued by the ability of our unique approach to generate well-behaved VHO-Fc candidates without having to perform framework engineering. The level of diversity along with patterns within each of the three CDRs could play some role in VHO stability [2,33]. Likewise, the NGS analysis after panning played a role in the selection of wellbehaved VHO-Fc candidates. \n\nThe TavoSelect process successfully generated diverse VHO candidates that identified new conformational activation sites on target antigens. Delivering such epitope diversity within the early stages of therapeutic biologics molecule discovery can provide quality in the end for the development of leads. Such diverse leads can cover a diverse patient population of a particular disease [36].",

The success of the selection process is dependent on the number, diversity and quality of the sequences present in the library. ][8] Different strategies have been used for the diversification of antibody libraries. Oligonucleotides can be used to randomly diversify defined positions in the complementary-determining regions (CDR) of antibody genes. 9,10 13]18 Natural antibody repertoires are an attractive source of diversity because, during B cell maturation, productive gene rearrangements are controlled at several stages. This proofreading mechanism increases the frequency of genes encoding a functional variable domain that are \n\nThe plasticity of natural immunoglobulin repertoires can be exploited for the generation of phage display libraries. Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, constitute interesting sources of diversity because they are rich in B cells, part of which can be affinity matured. These organs, however, differ in their anatomical structure, reflecting the different fluids they drain, which affects the B cell repertoires. The CDRH3 repertoires from these organs, extracted from na\u00efve or immunized mice, were compared in the context of phage display libraries using human antibody framework families. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that all libraries displayed different CDRH3 repertoires, but the one derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice was the most diverse. Library performance was assessed by in vitro selection. For both organs, immunization increased substantially the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen. The library derived from lymph nodes from na\u00efve mice, however, was the most effective in generating diverse and high affinity candidates. These results illustrate that the use of a biased CDRH3 repertoire increases the performance of libraries, but reduces the clonal diversity, which may be detrimental for certain strategies. \n\nhighlighted by the finding that hybridomas generated using B cells isolated from lymph nodes tend to provide higher affinity monoclonal antibodies. 21,22",

            "text": "The immune libraries are obtained from immunized animals or humans and are mostly used to discover antibodies against infectious pathogens (Trott et al., 2014) or antigenic targets in cancer patients (Thie et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2016). This library contains a restricted antibody repertoire that underwent antigen-driven in vivo selection (Barbas et al., 1991;Orum et al., 1993;Frenzel et al., 2016), which differs from the other phage display libraries, known as \"universal\", that theoretically provide binders for all possible antigen structures (Frenzel et al., 2016). The na\u00efve antibody libraries are generated from a pool of B lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, and one successful example is the scFv library licensed from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT; now part of MedImmune/AstraZeneca) (Javle et al., 2014;Almagro et al., 2019). While the na\u00efve libraries are derived from natural antibody gene repertoires, the synthetic ones are entirely based on in silico design to obtain individual antibody amino acid sequences (Fuh, 2007), bypassing the need to isolate antibody genes. The semisynthetic libraries, on the other hand, are created using both naturally and synthetically (in silico) randomized CDRs. In this library type, it is possible to redesign natural CDRs to improve the chance of finding antibodies with high specificity and affinity (Orum et al., 1993;Fuh, 2007). \n\nBuilding the phage display library is the most important step of this technology. There is a directly proportional relationship between the size of the antibody library and the probability of finding a particular antibody (Burioni et al., 1997;Almagro et al., 2019). The Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an important tool to analyze the variability, the sequence composition, and the size of antibody phage display libraries (Rouet et al., 2018). The construction of a phage display library is more expensive than generating hybridomas after animal immunization. However, the antibody screening step of the phage display method is faster and cheaper (Hentrich et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Since the seminal works by George Smith [1] and McCafferty et al. [6] over three decades ago, the field of antibody engineering has seen remarkable progress in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies. This progress has been built and is in part the product of several generations of phage display antibody libraries. In the previous sections, we reviewed nine of the libraries generated over the last decade. The goal was to assess the state of the art in phage display antibody discovery and outline commonalities and differences among the diverse libraries. The libraries reached 10 10 -10 11 antibody variants, the maximum possible size. The effective size, understood as the percentage of display, was 50-90%, with most of the libraries reaching 85%. Such libraries yielded nM or sub-nM binders. Interestingly, the average hit rate of the libraries was similar (\u224810%), regardless of the nature of the antibody repertoire-be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic-used as the substrate to build the libraries. The main difference seemed to be in the diversity and developability profiles of the antibodies. While na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, some antibodies selected from these libraries may bear developability liabilities. To circumvent this limitation, synthetic and semisynthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3. These new libraries, together with the recent expiration of patents in the field, should allow academic laboratories and small biotech organizations the free use of phage display methodology. The widespread use of antibody phage display should foster innovation, further the exploration of diverse and novel targets, and generate novel incremental improvements in the phage display methodology. \n\nFunding: This work was partially supported by the project \"Laboratorio Nacional para Servicios Especializados de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n (I + D + i) para Farmoqu\u00edmicos y Biotecnol\u00f3gicos, LANSEIDI-FarBiotec-CONACyT\".",

            "text": "Antibody libraries can be mined for reactivity against a wide range of targets and then to use the recombinant antibodies as reagents for target detection and characterization: this is well-illustrated in the area of proteomics. Ohara and colleagues compared the properties of recombinant Fabs from a library of synthetically diversified human antibodies with polyclonal antisera against the same targets and reported that the Fabs were well-suited to Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (69). Earlier, de Wildt et al. described experiments in which one or two rounds of conventional screening were used to isolate phage from synthetically diversified libraries constructed on single V H and V L frameworks. Clones (up to 12,000) were then picked and gridded out using robotics onto membranes coated with the targets to test their specificity (56). The study demonstrated the capacity of large display libraries to yield antibodies against a wide range of targets and the ability to extract antibodies against minor components of complex mixtures, given appropriate (robotic) methods for identification of the recognition of target. Other investigators have described phage selection using blots prepared from 2-dimensional gels -a use of the proteome itself as the target for extraction of specific antibodies from a library. \n\nFor na\u00efve or synthetically diversified libraries, the diversity of the resource is such that extraction of antibodies against human protein targets (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (2), human chorionic gonadotropin (28)), molecules that are highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and therefore poorly immunogenic (e.g., ubiquitin (56)) or toxic compounds (e.g., doxorubicin (5)) is possible. \n\nAntibodies isolated through phage display can be developed as diagnostic reagents but a more intriguing prospect is their use in construction of microarrays upon which binding of multiple analytes could be detected (40). Phage display is particularly valuable in this area of application because a single, highly diversified resource (the library) can be conveniently mined for antibodies against very many different targets. Some authors have described the use of stringent selection methods to isolate antibodies of very high affinity via phage display (70).",

            "text": "For instance, most mAbs produced via hybridoma technology are of murine origin and may induce human antimouse antibody responses in clinical settings [14]. To mitigate immunogenicity, antibodies from non-human species undergo a humanization process, either through chimerization or by grafting complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) on scaffolds from human Ig. However, these modifications can compromise the antibodies' binding affinity or stability, potentially reducing their therapeutic efficacy [15,16]. Consequently, screening antibodies from a human library is deemed the most effective approach for developing clinically applicable antibodies [17]. \n\nAmong various antibody libraries, such as synthetic, semi-synthetic, na\u00efve, immune libraries, and predefined CDR libraries tailored to specific requirements, the immune library offers a distinct advantage due to its repertoire specifically elicited against the target antigen [17][18][19][20][21]. Affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation and repeated exposure via immunization or natural infection enhances the specificity and efficacy of the antibodies. Antibodies sourced from immune libraries exhibit superior binding affinities compared to those from synthetic or na\u00efve libraries [17,22]. The human immune library, boasting its inherent diversity and eliminating the need for humanization, is an ideal source for library construction. Nonetheless, constructing a human immune library presents Methods Protoc. 2024, 7, 13 3 of 31 challenges, such as ethical considerations and the impracticality of deliberate immunization with the target antigen. Hence, the creation of a human immune scFv library typically relies on donated samples from individuals naturally exposed to the antigen or infected with the target pathogen [17,18,20,23]. \n\nThe innovative development of phage display by George P. Smith has revolutionized the field, offering an efficient technique for generating antibodies against specific antigens [24]. Phage display screening, or affinity selection, is characterized by its rapidity, the ability to screen vast libraries, superior efficiency compared to conventional hybridoma methods, and cost-effectiveness [25][26][27]. This method allows for the display of diverse scFv repertoires on the surface of filamentous phages, facilitating their binding to the desired antigen.",

Advances in protein engineering such as peptide cyclization, use of fusion proteins (e.g., the Fc fragment), unnatural amino acids and conjugation to polyethylene glycol and polysialic acids have mitigated some of these limitations. 83 As a consequence, there has been a recent re-emergence of peptidebased therapeutics development. 8 With the power and versatility of phage display, it is likely that phage display will continue to provide candidate peptides for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. 84,85 necdotal evidence has been used to support the hypothesis that a higher percentage of mAbs selected from synthetic or semisynthetic phage libraries have lower solubility profiles compared with murine hybridoma antibodies. 86 However, this phenomenon, if true, is easily overcome by employing a variety of techniques. Screening library outputs using a combination of cross interaction chromatography and dynamic light scattering have proven effective as early solubility screening techniques. 87",

            "text": "Phage display also allows for production of human antibodies without the need for humanized mice or concerns of Epstein-Barr virus or other potential pathogens present in human antibody-producing cell lines. Successful construction of phage display libraries derived from B cell pools from human donors or synthesized from human V-gene sequences has been reported [12][13][14][15]. At this time, three FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs are derived from phage display libraries. \n\nA potential downside of antibody production using phage display technology is the lack of a ''normal'' selection process. V H -V L pairs are randomly cloned into phage display vectors and undergo antigen selection in vitro. This selection process is distinct from the in vivo process where V H -V L pairs expressed on developing B cells undergo negative or positive selection events prior to antigen exposure. Although it has been argued that the processes of affinity selection by panning and screening for antigen-reactive clones mimic the processes of clonal selection and expansion utilized by the mammalian immune system [8], it is important to keep in mind that the lack of negative selection in a phage display library may result in selection of antibodies that would have been eliminated in vivo. Such antibodies might have cross-reactivity for both endogenous antigens and the antigen of choice and would not be useful for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, any unusual idiotype which elicits a strong immunogenic response has the potential to lose its effectiveness and may result in adverse events directly or in the form of circulating immune complexes. \n\nIn this study, we compared the diversity of the immune response generated by standard hybridoma technology to that of a phage display library. We chose tetanus toxoid (TT) as our model antigen because it is complex and contains multiple epitopes, which are expected to result in a diverse antibody response. The spleen of a single TT-immunized, BALB/c mouse was used for making a hybridoma library and phage display library. We expected greater V L and V H gene diversity in the selected phage display antibodies, but to our surprise, TT-specific antibodies produced by the hybridomas were much more diverse than those isolated from the phage display library, and there was little overlap among the V L and V H genes found in each library.",

            "text": "In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials. Such properties, collectively called developability [18,19], include (but are not limited to) cross-reactivity against the human target and orthologs from relevant tox species and animal models, solubility, expression yield in manufacturing cells, and thermal and long-term stability. Since these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence of the antibody, there has been a strong demand to generate phage display antibody libraries that not only enable the selection of highly specific and high affinity antibodies, but also those that are more developable. \n\nAs a result, numerous phage display antibody libraries have been built after the seminal work by John McCafferty and Gregory Winter in 1990 [6]. These libraries, their construction process, validation with diverse targets, and applications of the selected antibodies to diagnostic and/or therapeutic settings have been extensively reviewed in the literature [20][21][22][23][24][25]. Here, given the vast amount of information pertaining to phage display, compounded with space limitations, we review nine phage display scFv and Fab libraries published in the last decade (Table 1). These nine libraries are the latest generation of phage display antibody libraries and represent the state-of-the-art platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. We first discuss the functionality of the libraries in terms of size, quality, and diversity of the antibody repertoires. Second, we review and compare the outcome of the selection processes, i.e., the number of positive clones, hit rate, and affinity of the selected antibodies. Third, we discuss the performance of the libraries in terms of the developability of the selected antibodies. Finally, we highlight current opportunities and challenges relating to phage display platforms and other display technologies.",

            "text": "Screening phage display libraries is a powerful tool for identifying specific binders from libraries that contain a large diversity of targets [33,208]. Library construction is achieved by splicing a repertoire of genes (genotype) that encodes the peptide into a gene that encodes a capsid structural protein (phenotype). The \"displayed\" peptides are included in the capsid layer on the phage surface. Ideally, these proteins should not interfere with the phage structure [209]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology has enabled phage library construction whereby billions of variant peptides and proteins are able to be presented on the surface of the phage [210,211]. From this diversity library, binders specific to proteins of interest with high affinity can be selected by biopanning. This technique facilitates understanding of protein-ligand interactions [212], antigen-antibody interactions [213,214], and permits improvement of the affinity of proteins to their binding partner [215,216]. For instance, phage display antibody libraries with diversities as high as 10 10 can be established using display technology [217,218]. Recently, surface display technology has expanded to include ribosome display [219], yeast surface display [220], and mammalian cell display [221]. Such technologies have enabled the exploration of new antibodies that may not otherwise have been discovered, from humans and animals including shark, camel, llama, and lamprey [222][223][224][225]. \n\nAntibody phage display libraries have been used extensively for isolation of high-affinity specific binders against unique antigens from different targets [226][227][228][229][230]. Three types of antibody libraries are typically constructed: na\u00efve, synthetic, and immunized libraries [231]. A na\u00efve antibody library refers to the repertoire of antibody genes derived from non-immunized donors. Synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using synthesized V-gene fragments with randomized CDRs, whereas immunized libraries are based on a host immunized with the target antigen of the disease [232]. The principle of the phage display is represented in Figure 2, indicating the workflows of library construction, biopanning, and clone screening prior to protein expression and purification for functional assays.",

            "text": "are generated by a source for which the immune system had not been activated to recognize a specific antigen (na\u00efve) [132]. Moreover, due to the lack of affinity maturation, these universal libraries have low risk of immunogenicity [133]. In principle, a universal library can be applicable to mAb selection of any type of antigen. This is because the library comprises a high variability of antibody genes and comprises antibody genes from many donors [132]. Universal libraries are further sub-classified as na\u00efve, semi-synthetic, or fully-synthetic. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed from the natural human IgM repertoire (i.e., from not intentionally immunized donors) [132,133]. Examples of na\u00efve universal libraries are the human Fab library constructed by de Haard and colleagues at Dyax (now Shire) [137], the scFv libraries from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) [142,143], scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA59, and the HAL scFv libraries [135,144]. Fully synthetic libraries are constructed to include synthetic genes derived from known (human) antibody frameworks with the capacity to generate a large diversity in appropriate regions [145]. Semi-synthetic libraries are a combination of natural (i.e., donor-derived antibody) and synthetic antibody sequences [138]. A combination of na\u00efve and synthetic repertoires was used for the Dyax FAB310 library. Fully-synthetic libraries were developed by MorphoSys [133]. In addition, a particular type of antibody library is generated during guided phage display selection of human antibody using a non-human original antibody sequence. This strategy has been used for humanization and the discovery of fully human antibodies with similar properties to the murine antibody template, such as adalimumab [146].\n\nOverall, the identification of mAbs and mAb derivatives by phage display technology was a breakthrough that has enabled the isolation of human antibodies towards many types of antigen without immunization. Since then, it is one of the main platforms for generation of human therapeutic antibodies together with transgenic immunized mice, antibody humanization techniques, and single B-cell expression cloning [169].",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, in vitro selection technologies have matured as effective alternatives to animal immunization for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since the first description that antibody fragments can be expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and selected for specific binding to a target, phage display has become one of the most widely used in vitro approaches for the generation of antibodies for research and therapeutic applications [1,2]. More recently, the display of antibodies at the surface of yeast or mammalian cells, as well as cell free systems, such as ribosome display, have complemented the panel of technologies available for the isolation and engineering of antibodies and other protein scaffolds [3,4]. Regardless of the display package used for in vitro isolation of antibodies, a collection of diversified genes encoding antibody variable regions has to be generated. The diversity and quality of such an antibody gene library is of critical importance for success and the correlation between the number and affinity of antibodies that can be isolated and the library size has been demonstrated [5]. Thus, there has been significant effort to assemble very large antibody libraries, i.e., comprising between 10 8 and >10 11 members, so that, in principle, antibodies against any antigen can be identified [6][7][8]. \n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed either by capturing naturally rearranged immunoglobulin genes isolated from B cells or using synthetic approaches relying on mutagenesis of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described [9]. In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen [10,11]. In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher.",

            "text": "Therefore, it is vital to generate phage libraries that allow for the isolation of highly specific and diverse mAbs with high affinity against diverse antigens with optimal developability potential (128)(129)(130). \n\nCurrently, as a common practice in industrial pipelines, biopharmaceutical companies are implementing extensive developability assessments to determine the biochemical and biophysical features of antibody candidates to help identifying candidates with more favorable biophysical properties and to avoid difficulties during the downstream process (131,132). For example, in silico platforms, such as the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP) tool are used as a flagging system to predict mAbs with poor developability profiles by identifying anomalous values compared with therapeutic mAbs in clinical-stages. Indeed, features within the variable regions of mAbs, such as the total CDRs length, high hydrophobicity of V H and V L chains, lack of net charge symmetry, and/or the presence of patches of positive and negative charges were computationally predicted to be key factors in developability profiles of mAbs (133). \n\nThe probability of isolating high affinity, and more diverse mAbs that specifically bind random epitopes, increases significantly when biopanning campaigns are performed using larger antibody libraries. Library diversity is judged by how many functional antibody fragments are able to identify as many different antigens as possible (134). The bacterial transformation step during library construction; however, is a main practical bottleneck that limits the size of the library from exceeding 10 11 antibody variants, even after optimization and performing numerous electroporation steps. \n\nIdeally, antibody phage display libraries should not only be large and diverse, but also should display antibody variants as functional fragments. Issues related to the nucleotide sequences, such as the presence of stop codons, or the addition/deletion of nucleotides can occur during the library construction (135)(136)(137). These issues might inhibit the production of functional pIII-antibody fusions or change the reading frame of the antibody gene sequence, which could negatively affect their biophysical characteristics.",

            "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

Moreover, antibodies with high specificity and affinity against diverse random protein antigens were also discovered from the GH2 antibody library with the same phage display selection and screening process in vitro, indicating that antibodies with high affinity and specificity from the natural antibody repertoires biased to the predominant antibody CDR structures were readily available to counter diverse protein immunogens. It seems that natural antibody repertoires are shaped through evolution to converge to only few predominant antibody structural classes that can be readily encoded, within the complexity limit, with many functional antibodies capable of binding to varieties of protein antigens with high specificity and affinity without the need to extensively relying on SHM to explore the antibody sequence space. The rudimentary principles encoded in the GH2 antibody library suggest that the configuration of the variable domain structures and the associated diversity of the CDR sequences underlie the functionality of the natural antibody repertoires. Phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries can be further used to decipher the natural antibody responses and to develop novel antibodies against diverse antigens.",

            "text": "We wondered whether this problem may be the direct result of the designs of prior in vitro display libraries, which inevitably lead to libraries having substantial levels of \"contamination\" with poorly developable antibodies. In the case of natural libraries, the random nature of variable heavy and variable light (VH/VL) chain pairing may create poorly developable combinations, while synthetic diversity may create artificial complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequences that fold poorly. \n\nWe hypothesized that a library comprising a defined collection of natural CDR sequences from which most known sequence-based liabilities were eliminated, embedded within paired frameworks derived exclusively from well-behaved therapeutic molecules, would facilitate the discovery of highly developable antibodies directly from the library. Reasoning that the stringent quality control applied to antibodies undergoing natural B-cell maturation would also apply to their individual CDRs, a library comprising replicated natural CDRs informatically purged of sequence liabilities could provide superior biophysical properties when used as a diversity source. While it remains difficult to predict the relevant properties of therapeutic antibodies on the basis of primary sequence alone, many short sequence liabilities have been identified, particularly those related to chemical instability or polyreactivity, including, for example, N-glycosylation motifs, asparagine deamidation motifs, aspartate isomerization motifs, unpaired cysteines, surface hydrophobic/aromatic patches and others (Table 1). \n\nBuilding on pioneer antibody library designs (generation 1) [17][18][19][20][21][22] and other designs that further improved the capabilities of in vitro antibody discovery (generation 2), [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] here we present a \"Generation 3\" library architecture that leverages developability data on therapeutic antibodies, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of human repertoires, and high-throughput synthetic oligonucleotide synthesis to create a platform able to yield large numbers of high affinity, developable antibodies against any target.",

These formats have been inspired by V H H Camelidae antibodies [93] and shark's new antigen receptors (NARs) [94]. Due to its size and high stability, nanobodies have found several therapeutic applications, and therapeutic molecules, such as caplacizumab from Ablynx [95], have recently been commercialized. On the other hand, display platforms other than phage have been developed and are used to discover therapeutic antibodies. These platforms include ribosome [96], bacteria [97], and mammalian [98] display methods. Each of these platforms has advantages and disadvantages with respect to phage display, with yeast being one of the most broadly used display platforms [99]. Yeast display has proven to be an efficient means to isolate antibodies with very high affinity, e.g., in the low femto-molar range [100]. Moreover, while phage is limited to the display of antibody fragments, e.g., sdAb, scFv, or Fab, yeast enables the display of full IgG antibodies with glycosylation. Since the end therapeutic product is commonly an IgG and its efficacy and toxicity are an interplay between target epitope, affinity, Fc isotype, and glycosylation, yeast display has become a suitable platform for efficient therapeutic discovery and development [101].",

Semisynthetic libraries, therefore, combine synthetic CDRs (typically three light chain CDRs and heavy chain CDR1 and CDR2) and heavy chain CDR3 from natural repertoires. Phage libraries can be designed for either antibody discovery or engineering. The design of the latter is based on one parental antibody and tailored for one specific target. This review will focus on design of three generations of universal antibody phage display libraries for antibody discovery ( Table 2).",

            "text": "The phage display methodology has been shown to be a valuable, robust, and efficient platform to discover and develop human therapeutic antibodies. Until recently, however, the commercial use of phage display was limited to a few companies holding their technology patents [16]. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, the libraries listed in Table 1 are not available for research purposes. Nevertheless, most of the patents covering phage display have expired in Europe and the United States [16], offering a great opportunity to freely use phage display. As this methodology is becoming a commodity, several companies are licensing phage display antibody libraries such as ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 (https://www.globalbioinc.com/Services/). Also, Bio-Rad Laboratories is offering discovery services based on HuCAL PLATINUM (https://www.bio-rad-antibodies.com/hucal-ordering-information.html) at a relatively low cost. On the other hand, a number of phage display antibody libraries generated before 2010 (not reviewed here but widely validated) are available to academic laboratories at The University of Cambridge or the Scottish Biologics Facility (https://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbf/about/sbf-libraries/). These libraries include the synthetic antibody libraries known as Tomlinson's libraries [86], built at the UK Medical Research Council and a human na\u00efve library of over 10 10 human antibodies generated by John McCafferty and his colleagues. Tomlinson's synthetic libraries have produced specific and high affinity antibodies for a number of targets [87,88], whereas McCafferty's na\u00efve library has been used to select, screen, and sequence around 38,000 recombinant antibodies against almost 300 antigens. \n\nRegarding opportunities for improving current libraries, an ideal antibody library should generate diverse, highly specific, and high affinity antibodies, as well as developable molecules with a minimum of effort, i.e., only two to three rounds of panning. An important parameter and perhaps the simplest one to be considered when building an antibody phage display library is its size, as it correlates with the probability of selecting higher affinity antibodies, as predicted by Perelson [34].",

            "text": "Technologies to generate replenishable sources of target-specific antibodies have revolutionized biomedical research and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Hybridoma technology (1) is a highly effective and well-established method to generate murine monoclonal antibodies, and is still widely used to produce antibodies for a variety of applications, including therapeutic antibodies. More recently, in vitro methods have been developed to generate target-specific antibodies. Most notably, the development of in vitro display technologies (2) such as phage display, has enabled rapid isolation of target-specific antibodies from large antibody libraries. Advantages of the in vitro display methods include the speed and ease of antibody generation, the ability to control various selection parameters, and the ability to generate fully human antibodies for therapeutic development. Consequently, high-affinity, high-specificity antibodies suitable for demanding applications can readily be produced and engineered by these technologies, and phage display is now a major technical platform to generate therapeutic antibody candidates. \n\nThe success of in vitro antibody generation depends largely upon the quality and the size of the antibody library. In case of phage and yeast display libraries (the two most widely used methods), the size of a library is simply determined by the efficiency of host cell transformation. On the other hand, a lot of different factors can influence the quality of a library. This is especially true for the synthetic antibody libraries (Table 1); unlike natural antibody libraries (3)(4)(5)(6)(7) which are constructed by PCR-amplification of V(D)J-rearranged immunoglobulin genes from B-cell cDNA and thus do not require human input during the generation of sequence diversity, the strategy for the sequence diversification is necessary, and indeed critical, for the construction of synthetic antibody libraries. Most of the existing synthetic antibody libraries have their sequence diversity concentrated in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), and generated by random combinations of mono-or trinucleotide units (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). The CDRs of a synthetic antibody library need to be designed so that the resulting library is enriched with diverse, yet nature-like sequences, which are stable and highly expressed in host cells.",

            "text": "This review has considered the phage display of Fabs, scFvs and nanobodies. With potential application to all recombinant antibody library types are the recent improvement in library design and display efficiency. The diversity within the CDR regions can now be designed with considerable accuracy by using trimer phosphoramidine codons to mimic natural amino acid usage [52]. Furthermore, improvements have been made in reducing cloning errors due to the presence of linker repeat regions [49]. Both advances will facilitate the optimal cloning of diversity into libraries in the future. The co-expression of chaperones and isomerases [34,36] as well as the use of the co-translation secretion pathway with optimised signal sequences [25] can significantly improve antibody phage display efficiency, thereby improving the efficiency of isolating binders. These same strategies also improve soluble antibody expression levels. Furthermore, the identification and use of highly stable Fabs and scFvs as scaffold for the introduction of synthetic diversity have improved expression and stability of the resulting antibody fragments [31,32,50,66]. The combined use of these strategies to yield higher expression levels and increased stability has the potential to produce more efficient phage display of antibodies and therefore improve panning efficacy. They should also produce more useful reagents. \n\nMethods suitable for the batch reformatting of both Fabs and scFvs into IgGs for high-level expression in mammalian cell culture are now also described [26,27,58,59]. These will facilitate the efficient cloning of sub-libraries of antibody fragments from panning experiments to allow them to be screened as IgGs. This has previously been a bottleneck in developing therapeutics from phage display libraries, as the monovalent recombinant antibody fragments often have very different properties to their concomitant divalent IgGs. \n\nNanobodies from both camelids and sharks are readily amenable to the production of simple, high diversity phage display libraries [18,19]. They provide small antibodies with very high stability, therefore potentially offering unique properties for diagnostic or even therapeutic applications.",

Mining strategies that yield a panel of human mAbs to a variety of different epitopes of an antigen of interest are suitable for the development of human pAbs.

            "text": "Therapeutic antibodies can be discovered via in vivo, in vitro or in silico approaches [1,2]. In vivo approach relies on the immunization of wild type or transgenic animals carrying human antibody gene segments, while in vitro approach employs the selection power by display technologies to pan large and diverse antibody libraries [3]. Both approaches have been proved very successful and have generated best-selling antibody therapeutics such as Keytruda and Humira, respectively [4,5]. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning also facilitated in silico rational antibody design [1]. \n\nIn vitro selection of synthetic antibody libraries complements in vivo immunization-based approaches by providing unique, non-natural antibody paratopes and escaping the limitations of self-tolerance [6,7]. One of challenges in the rational design of man-made antibody diversity lies in the complementarity determining region (CDR) H3 loop (CDR-H3) of antibody heavy chain variable region. Traditionally, CDR-H3 loop was randomly diversified by degenerate codons or parsimonious degenerate codons 102 Antibody Therapeutics, 2021 [8], which limited the therapeutic potential of antibody hits. Although TRInucleotide technology and Slonomics technology helped to reduce dysfunctional motifs and to precisely control the codon biases, the CDR-H3 still could not fully mimic that of natural diversity generated by V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation process [9,10]. This limits the translational success of therapeutic antibody candidates derived from in vitro selection of phage or yeast libraries [11]. Recently, massive datasets of human immune repertoires by Briney, Soto and others made it possible for us to survey billions of antibody heavy chain sequences for a better understanding of CDR-H3 natural diversity at immune repertoire level [12][13][14]. \n\nIn this study, we aim to understand natural immune diversity of the CDR-H3 loop in a precisely controlled manner. From antibody engineers' perspective, we observed CDR-H3 length-dependent usage of human IGHJ4 and IGHJ6 gene segments in the natural human immune repertoire.",

            "text": "there are two types of in vitro-made phage antibody libraries: the so-called \"natural\" and \"synthetic\" libraries, which are further subdivided according to the used gene repertoire. currently, a number of phage display antibody libraries have been fully or partially obtained from natural sources; thus mrnA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes, bone marrow or the spleen [17,18]. Libraries of human antibodies are of special interest, since the selected antibodies can be used for the development of therapeutics. Since most of the families encoding human V-genes are rarely used in the immune response, only the often-occurring gene families are usually used for library construction: V H1 -V H3 (from the heavy-chain gene family) and V K1 -V K4 , and also V \u03bb1 -V \u03bb3 (from the light-chain gene family). Both random recombination of the light-and heavy-antibody chains and the variability of the hyper-variable regions (complementarity determining region -cDr) of the V H and V L chains play an important role in the variability of the library. . natural antibody libraries are divided into \"immune\" and \"na\u00efve\" libraries. Immune libraries based on peripheral lymphocytes extracted from humans immunized by a certain antigen are valuable for medical research, since they provide increasing probability of selecting antibodies that could be used for therapy [19].\n\n\"na\u00efve\" libraries based on lymphocyte mrnA extracted from unimmunized healthy people are used for obtaining antibodies directed against a wide multitude of antigens, including autoantigens [20]. these \"na\u00efve\" libraries mostly represent the germline diversity of antibodies.\n\nSynthetic libraries were introduced in order to increase the variety and size of the library and to enhance the antibody's characteristics. Synthetic phage antibody libraries are divided into two groups: 1) Synthetic libraries based on a single-core V-gene; 2) Synthetic libraries based on a multiple-core V-genes.\n\nLibraries of the first type are based on a single gene, which is then mutagenized in all the cDrs or just the cDrs in the V H -domains. In this case, library diversity is limited by the degeneracy of the synthetic DnA which is used to change the sequence of the cDr",

            "text": "The fundamental difference between immune or na\u00efve libraries and synthetic libraries consists in the origin of the sequences used to build the library. While immune and na\u00efve libraries are amplified from a natural source, synthetic library parts are diversified by design. In synthetic libraries the antibody diversity is designed in silico and then synthesized in a controlled fashion. \n\nThe ratio of naturally-derived and synthetically-designed parts varies in different libraries from semi-to fully synthetic. An advantage of synthetic diversification is that the composition of the CDRs can be exactly defined and controlled. \n\nSynthetic libraries can further be grouped according to the acceptor frameworks used, the origin or design of the sequence diversity within the CDR regions and the method used for building the library. \n\nThe first semi-synthetic libraries used a variety of different framework genes to keep diversity high [55,56,62,79]. In 1992 Hoogenboom and Winter described semi-synthetic scFv-antibody phage display libraries, comprising 49 germline VH sequences and a single V_lambda 3 light chain sequence [79]. Five or eight residues in the CDR-H3 were randomized in a PCR-based approach to generate libraries with a size of 1 \u00d7 10 7 . Subsequent libraries were based on the same set of acceptor VH frameworks, with the addition of 26 kappa and 21 lambda sequences [62]. Length variability was introduced in the CDR3s and diversity generated through randomization of 4-12 residues in CDR-H3, 1-3 residues in kappa CDR-L3 and 0-5 residues in lambda CDR-L3. In parallel, library size increased over three orders of magnitude up to 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 . \n\nIn a similar approach, de Kruif and collaborators used all 49 human germline VH genes and seven different light chain genes (4 V_kappa, 3 V_lambda) with CDR-H3 length variability between 6-15 residues to construct a library of the size of 3.6 \u00d7 10 8 . \n\nThe shorter CDR-H3s of six amino acid length were fully randomized, whereas for the longer CDR-H3s the design included a stretch of fully randomized amino acid residues flanked by regions of lower diversity resembling human antibody sequences [56].",

Recent advances in the production of highly diverse and functional antibody libraries are considered here, including for Fabs, scFvs and nanobodies. These advances include codon optimisation during generation of CDR diversity, improved display levels using novel signal sequences, molecular chaperones and isomerases and the use of highly stable scaffolds with relatively high expression levels. In addition, novel strategies for the batch reformatting of scFv and Fab phagemid libraries, derived from phage panning, into IgG formats are described.

            "text": "From the early 1990s, phage display technology was explored as a new method for generating mAbs (28,29). In this approach, the V gene repertoires were harvested from lymphocytes, and the combinations of VHs and VLs were cloned and expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage by fusion to its coat protein (Figure 1). Then, phage particles bearing expressed specific mAbs on their tips were selected and used in conventional assays. Compared with the hybridoma technology, which was practically confined to rodents, phage display has been successfully used to screen and isolate mAbs from any species whose immunoglobulin genes are known (30,31). In 2000, Rader et al. first described the whole process of selecting rabbit mAbs with phage display technology (32). This technology was successfully used in selecting and humanizing rabbit antibodies against human A33 antigen, a target antigen for the immunotherapy of colon cancer, and the obtained humanized antibodies retained high specificity and affinity for human A33 antigen (32). At present, antibody phage display is a major technical platform to generate fully human antibodies for therapeutic purpose for its high speed and ease of antibody generation and the ability to control various selection parameters in vitro (33). \n\nDependent on our knowledge of antibody structure, function, and sequence diversity, in addition to the insights from previous antibody libraries, a new synthetic antibody library technology was developed and used in mAb production by inserting precisely designed sequences into the antigen-combining site (34,35). This technology is accomplished based on genetically copying IgG fragments and on using molecular biology techniques to diversify antibody paratopes in vitro (36). Several synthetic antibody libraries (e.g., HuCAL and Ylanthia library) with multiple variable heavy and light chain framework regions were designed and used to isolate human mAbs optimized for molecular recognition (37)(38)(39)(40). With advances in library designs and selection methods, synthetic antibody libraries will become an indispensable tool for rapid generation of target-binding mAbs with exquisite specificity.",

            "text": "Figure S8b). One can speculate that this is simply because the dataset 3 has many more approved antibodies derived from animals than from phage display, skewing the data. However, if we look only at approved antibodies, those that are phage-derived still perform markedly worse (Suppl. Figure S8c). The antibodies described here show good results in these tests, despite being developed using phage (and yeast) display, indicating that the present library format in combination with sequential phage and yeast display are able to deliver antibodies as good or better than current in vivo technology. Further testing on 86 different antibodies discovered from other selection campaigns carried out using this library showed that 14% of antibodies had AC-SINS results worse than the therapeutic range (<6.6 nm), 3 compared to 20% for a natural library (Suppl. Figure S9), with the median AC-SINS values for all antibodies derived from the Generation 3 platform (2.1 nm) lower than those (3.0 nm) derived from a natural phage library also selected using only phage display. This suggests the problem is not inherent to display technology, but more a function of antibody library design. , perhaps facilitated by the quality control exerted by the yeast endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathway. 68,69 Nonetheless, different antigens may present unique challenges (e.g., charged or hydrophobic patches) and may require specific strategies to overcome biases and obtain developable leads. Developability problems can be, and often are, addressed downstream of the selection process by discarding antibodies containing sequence liabilities after in vitro selection or in vivo development, an approach that effectively reduces functional library size. Instead of discarding binders with developability issues, further engineering to improve the biophysical properties of promising leads can also be undertaken -of note, the existence of a sequence liability (e.g., NxS glycosylation site) does not necessarily mean that the antibody will be poorly developable (e.g., glycosylation leading to immunogenicity). However, assessing the nature of the liabilities and engineering if necessary is a process that may consume months and incur substantial additional expense.",

            "text": "More the three decades ago, the seminal works by George Smith 35,36 and Greg Winter 6 gave birth to the phage display technology as a platform for peptide and antibody discovery. In the subsequent thirty plus years practicing phage display, it has been well established that the size and functionality of a library are critical parameters for success in isolating specific and high affinity antibodies from said library. Early selections from antibody phage-displayed libraries of 10 7 members generated ~90 nM antibody fragments to diverse proteins. 12 Further studies using larger libraries, e.g., >10 10 members, 8,13 produced antibody fragments with single-digit nM or sub-nM affinities. Similarly, a synthetic library called the Griffiths' library 9 of >10 10 members produced sub-nM binders, whereas antibody fragments of >100 nM were obtained when a small portion of the library containing only 10 7 clones was used in the selection process. \n\nIn parallel, as therapeutic antibody engineering and development evolved in the past decades, and dozens of antibodies were granted marketing approvals, it has been realized that reaching the desired specificity and affinity is not enough. 4,16 Other biological and biophysical properties such as expression, stability and solubility should be considered during the early discovery phase, so that the risks of failure in the late therapeutic development phase are minimized. This is particularly true for antibodies isolated using phage display, where the discovery process is performed in vitro, without the filters imposed in vivo. In such cases, the selected antibodies must be extensively scrutinized to ensure they meet the proper threshold of stability, solubility and low aggregation at the concentrations needed for therapeutic development. 17 e approached the design and construction of ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 keeping these concepts in mind, i.e., generation of large and functional libraries with enhanced stability and low aggregation. We followed a three-step construction process that led to a progressive increase in functionality and stability, culminating in a valuable source of antibodies, as showed by panning the libraries using different strategies and an array of seven non-related targets. In all the cases specific antibodies were obtained. The best anti-HSA antibody and the two anti-TNF ones had a biophysical profile that meet the success criteria of antibody candidates amenable to further development.",

            "text": "age libraries mainly reflects improvements of overall developability properties.\n\nIt has been reported that the presence of library clones that do not display antibody fragments (bald phage) is partially due to stop codons or frameshifts present in the antibody gene. These clones often outgrow because of the decreased burden on production of antibody fusion proteins and higher infectivity due to all wild type pIII molecules on phage particle, resulting in loss of library diversity. In efforts to increase functional library size, several strategies have been developed. For example, anti-tag antibody was used for proofreading panning to select in-frame sequences due to the tag being inframe with the antibody sequence. 177 In the design of the HuCAL GOLD library, the \u03b2-lactamase gene was used to eliminate frame-shifted sequences. 98 Regarding framework usage in a phage display library, it is generally accepted that a library using multiple frameworks will perform better than one using a single pair of frameworks, since multiple scaffolds provide more structural diversity. 100 For selection of framework, parameters, such as frequency in natural repertories, stability, expression, and display level, have been taken into consideration. Moreover, it should be noted that several heavy chain germline genes, e.g., certain IGVH4 family genes, have been found to be deselected during phage panning. 93,98 Also, VH4-34 has been found to be associated with B cell cytotoxicity. 178 Thus, these germlines should be excluded from the library design. For the majority of the phage display libraries, V H and V L are randomly rearranged, which agrees with the observation that there is no obvious preference of V H /V L pairing in natural repertories. 179 However, in terms of drug development, since different V H /V L pairings do exhibit very distinct biophysical characteristics, 100,180 attention should be given to the choice of framework pairing.\n\nCompared to in vivo antibody discovery approaches, another advantage of phage display is that the sequence information can be retrieved rapidly and readily. However, this advantage is partially attenuated by the conventional screening approach of characterization of individual clones, in which only a small percentage of sequence information, i.e., the most abundant sequences, from",

            "text": "Identifying antibodies with high affinity and target specificity is crucial for drug discovery and development; however, filtering out antibody candidates with nonspecific or polyspecific binding profiles is also important. In this issue of Cell Reports Methods, Saksena et al. report a computational counterselection method combining deep sequencing and machine learning for identifying nonspecific antibody candidates and demonstrate that it has advantages over more established molecular counterselection methods. \n\nTraditional antibody discovery processes make heavy use of screening platforms, such as phage, yeast, and mammalian display technologies (Parola et al., 2018). These methods link the phenotype and genotype of proteins displayed and allow for rapid selection of large libraries of proteins including antibodies and antibody fragments. For phage display, the platform used in Saksena et al. (2022), the most common type of antibody fragments displayed are single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and antigen-binding fragments (Fabs). Till now, phage display libraries with diversities up to 10 11 sequences have been constructed and used extensively for antibody drug discovery. Traditional discovery by display platforms consist of performing several rounds of selection against target antigens, resulting in a pool of antigenspecific clones that then undergo additional experimental characterization and possibly follow-up engineering (e.g., affinity maturation) to select for therapeutic lead candidates. \n\nIn addition to high affinity to the target, a critical property for any antibody drug candidate is having minimal off-target binding. However, antibodies with offtarget binding may also become enriched and selected through a screening process such as phage display. These polyspecific or nonspecific antibodies have the capacity to bind unrelated antigens and are often linked to non-ideal pharmacokinetic profiles (Ho \u00a8tzel et al., 2012). There has been evidence that suggests nonspecific antibody sequences can be identified through shared features. For example, the VH6 germline family was identified as a source of nonspecific clones derived from a yeast-displayed naive human antibody library (Kelly et al., 2017). Additionally, certain physicochemical properties of amino acids in antibody variable regions have been found to be associated with nonspecific binding (Zhang et al., 2020).",

Such modulation of antibody properties is often achieved by random mutagenesis, directed mutagenesis primarily of residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (based on the assumption that CDRs carry much of the specificity-determining diversity of human antibodies), DNA shuffling, or chain shuffling, and subsequent selection of variants with improved properties. Selection can be achieved using a diversity of technologies like those relying on display on phage, yeast, or bacteria and the processes can achieve substantial maturation of e.g. the affinity, which may translate into improved performance in a given therapeutic setting. Ribosomal display even carries an inherent ability to evolve genes during the selection procedure (15) thereby advancing a maturation process, as selection from an original library proceeds. Given the potential size of molecular diversity space, it is only possible to assess a very limited fraction of that space in any given experiment. It is thus important to limit diversity to that acceptable for appropriate protein folding, as only such diversity is likely to deliver a functional product and thereby an appropriate outcome of the evolution process. Furthermore, it is envisaged that minimal diversification away from human antibody sequences that commonly occur in vivo is preferred in order to minimize the likelihood that the protein will be immunogenic and able to induce an anti-drug immune response during clinical use.",

Three Phage Display commercial platforms (MorphoSys HuCal, Cambridge Antibody Technology, and Dyax) stand out as possible sources of molecules that have gone through clinical trials.

The biospecificity of adalimumab demonstrates a realization of the expected advantages of phage display as a drug discovery technology. Additionally, the case of adalimumab demonstrates the contribution of phage display, in conjunction with guided selection methods. Adalimumab is approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. 25 According to the boxed warning in the US prescriber information, adalimumab is associated with a risk of serious infections and malignancy. 25 dalimumab was discovered using phage display with a \"guided selection\" method involving a mouse mAb. Briefly, the heavy chain of a murine antibody able to bind to TNF was combined with a collection of human light chains and selected for binding to hTNF. The selected light chains were then combined with a collection of human heavy chains and further selected for binding to hTNF and to an N-terminal peptide of hTNF. 26 In this strategy, a library of candidates is applied to immobilized antigen in the presence of a competitor that binds at the active site of interest.",

            "text": "This is evidenced by the fact that only one study opted to employ the entire bacteriophage (T7 Select \u00ae ) (40), and only one utilized the Phagemid vector pJB12 in combination with the M13 K07DpIII hyperphage system for the multivalent display of VHHs (40). \n\nAlso, the selection of the display platform employed by different research groups plays a significant role in the phage display technique for antibody generation, as it can affect expression in phages, yeast, mammalian cells, or other platforms (23). This choice is intrinsically linked to the specific objectives of each group. Expression in bacteria is often an initial step, but if a suitable binder for an antigen cannot be identified, other expression systems may be explored. Systems such as yeast and mammalian cells prioritize post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and offer alternative antibody formats that may enhance affinity for the target. \n\nThe quality of the antibody library plays a pivotal role in determining the final quality of isolated antibodies throughout the selection process. There is a need for these antibodies to accurately mirror the immunological repertoire, demonstrating affinity and specificity for the desired target. One of the characteristics directly influencing the quality of the library is its size, as larger libraries increase the likelihood of obtaining antibodies capable of recognizing the target (42,44). Additionally, the diversity of the library also impacts the selection process, as it is responsible for generating a broad spectrum of antibodies capable of effectively binding to specific targets (44). Another relevant aspect to consider is the affinity of the antibodies obtained at the end of the campaign, a crucial feature in the development of molecules with therapeutic properties. This feature stands out when analyzing the library's quality, as a positive correlation has been observed between the affinity that the obtained antibodies can achieve and the size of the library. In other words, a larger library provides the potential to identify antibodies with higher affinity (42). It is worth noting that immune libraries generally have the ability to generate antibodies with superior affinities compared to Naive and artificially synthesized libraries, although there is less diversity, as the immune library has already been directed towards a specific target through the immunization process. In this scenario, the unique characteristics of Nbs make them excellent candidates for constructing antibody fragment libraries.",

            "text": "The first synthetic library was constructed by Marks et al. (1991). For this purpose, a repertoire of human VH genes from 49 human germline VH-gene segments in vitro rearranged was developed to create a synthetic CDR3 of five to eight residues. For phage display, rearranged VH genes were cloned with a human V\u03bb3 light chain as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). The selection resulted in the isolation of many antibodies against haptens and one against a protein antigen. These great results were part of the first proof of concept for synthetic antibodies. Thereafter, to cover the natural length diversity of the loop of the CDR3, the diversity was expanded from 4 to 12 residues (Nissim et al., 1994). The success of the expanded library showed the importance of diversity in a longer CDR-H3 loop. To improve the synthetically rearranged VH gene repertoire of Nissim et al. (1994) and Griffiths et al. (1994) developed a novel system to add light-chain diversity to the  Library size corresponds to the number of colony forming units (cfu) after the transformation of E. coli with the corresponding DNA library. \n\nprevious VH gene repertoire. In this study, 26 human germline Vk and 21 germline V\u03bb segments were assembled into complete V genes using PCR with CDR3 loops partially randomized to mimic the diversity generated by V-J gene recombination in vivo. In order to create a large synthetic repertoire of Fab fragments displayed on a filamentous phage, the heavy and light-chain V-gene repertoires were combined on a phage vector in bacteria using the lox-Cresite-specific-recombination system. This resulted in the development of antibodies with affinities similar to those obtained from a secondary immune response in mice (Griffiths et al., 1994). A summary of some of the phage display antibody libraries used in the discovery of therapeutic antibodies is shown in Table 1.",

            "text": "The great advantage of the pIII phage library is that it can display large foreign proteins on its surface with one to five copies, that makes the pIII system the most commonly used in phage display libraries. The main advantage of this phagemid system is their smaller size and ease of cloning (B\u00e1b\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 2013;Tan et al., 2016). With the growing use of antibody fragments and singledomain antibodies, grows the necessity to improve the phage display systems. For instance, in order to improve the number of scFvs presented on filamentous phage particles, a new kind of phages were developed, known as hyperphages. Hyperphages have a pIII phenotype and are able to infect E. coli, however, lack the functional pIII gene, which means that the phagemid-encoded pIII-antibody fusion is the source of pIII in phage assembly. These unique features increase the phage particles that are carrying the scFv on their surface, increasing the antigen-binding activity more than 50% compared to 3% when conventional phages were used (Rondot et al., 2001;Pande et al., 2010). \n\nA critical feature to maximize the chance of discovering an antibody with the desired characteristics is the type of antibody source used. There are three main types of antibody libraries: immune, na\u00efve, and synthetic (Winter et al., 1994;Hoogenboom, 2002;K\u00fcgler et al., 2018). Immunized libraries use as antibody source the lymphoid tissues of a donor that was previously immunized with a specific antigen or, in some instances, individuals with a particular disease, such as cancer or a particular infection. Normally, this type of library results in higher-affinity antibodies than those generated from hybridomas and na\u00efve libraries, as gene fragments go through an in vivo maturation process (Winter et al., 1994;Griffiths and Duncan, 1998;Hoogenboom, 2002;Bradbury and Marks, 2004). However, as immunizations are required, immune libraries include certain limitations.",

            "text": "The development of antibody therapeutics relies on the identification of a suitable binder towards a clinically relevant target. Though computational methods promising fully de novo design are making advances (Wilman et al., 2022), well-established experimental protocols still dominate antibody discovery (Lu et al., 2020). \n\nTherapeutic antibodies are primarily discovered via phage display or animal immunizations. These protocols produce a large number of potential binders in response to a target. In animal immunization, one would typically look for expanded clones upon antigen challenge (Saggy et al., 2012;Laustsen et al., 2021). In phage display, one would likewise focus on an 'enriched' set of sequences (Chan et al., 2014;Saka et al., 2021;Zhang, 2023) between rounds of panning. Antibodies in the original set can represent diverse epitopes and developability profiles. One is tasked to downsample the initial set of antibodies (1000s) coming from such experiments to a smaller set (10s). The smaller set is subjected to costlier, more detailed assays designed to further narrow the scope of drug lead candidates. Ideally, the diversity of representatives should offer a good balance between binding propensity, epitope bins, and developability profiles. Testing a set of functionally promising, but close-to-identical, molecules would yield close-to-identical assay results, not hedging the bets on covering a wide spectrum of functionalities and developability profiles. Randomly picking from the initial set of antibodies does not guarantee to select the 'best' or most diverse candidates, especially if there is a bias towards a set of clones. \n\nDownsampling a diverse set of representatives was typically achieved by grouping the initial set of sequences and selecting representatives from these. For instance, in immunization, the 'expanded clones' were identified by grouping sequences by their V-J gene assignments, CDR-H3 lengths, and a high cutoff (>80% sequence identity).",

            "text": "As highlighted earlier, the basic requirement for antibody phage display is the accessibility of an antibody library for screening. Antibody libraries are useful assets for antibody development programs as they can be applied for various targets for multiple applications. In general, antibody libraries are classified into four categories, namely the na\u00efve, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries. The classification of the antibody libraries are mainly influenced by the source of antibody V genes for library generation [93]. Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using V genes from non-immunized donors [93,94]. Immune antibody libraries however are constructed utilizing antibody V genes from immunized donors or infected individuals [93]. Synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries are constructed using synthesized DNA oligonucleotides where the repertoire diversity is devoid of any natural immune maturation processes [95]. This chapter will focus on the principles and characteristics of na\u00efve libraries including the application of antibodies derived from na\u00efve libraries in combating infectious diseases.\n\nNa\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using B cells of unimmunized or healthy donors, normally focusing on the IgM isotype. Na\u00efve libraries are supposedly able to be used for the isolation of mAbs against any antigen [96]. The process involved in the generation of na\u00efve antibody libraries is well established and has been described in numerous publications [97][98][99][100]. The human natural antibody repertoire is approximately 10 11 in size, which is a thousand times larger than the murine na\u00efve antibody repertoire [101]. However, antibodies isolated from na\u00efve antibody libraries usually exhibit lower affinities compared to antibodies isolated from immunized libraries. This is because the na\u00efve repertoire would not have undergone in vivo affinity maturation to produce higher affinity antibodies [96]. During antibody library generation, several critical aspects that are monitored includes library size and repertoire diversity in determining the quality of the library [102]. In the case of na\u00efve libraries, larger library sizes are preferred to ensure higher affinity mAbs are isolated. The correlation between larger library sizes with higher affinity mAbs has been reported in several instances as high affinity clones were successfully retrieved from larger size libraries compared to smaller size antibody libraries [93,103,104].\n\nThe actual source where antibody genes are retrieved from is a vital consideration during the construction process of antibody libraries. Antibody genes could be sourced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P",

            "text": "A key characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its capacity to generate useful antibodies directed against invading pathogens. For this, the antibody repertoire expressed by B cells within an organism constantly evolves in response to infection. Phage, yeast, ribosome or bacterial display methodologies [1], [2] are employed extensively for the generation of antibodies to be used for research and therapeutic applications [3], [4]. This approach aims at recapitulating the process of appropriate antibody creation by the immune system, via in vitro selection of target-specific antibodies starting from a large repository of immunoglobulin genes [5]. \n\nStrategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity [6], [7], [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires [9], [10], [11], [12]. A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity [11], [13], [14], [15]. One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16].",

We will discuss in particular (i) libraries that are designed to contain antibody sequences with fewer liabilities, (ii) selection steps to deplete screened libraries of candidates that exhibit issues such as high aggregation propensity or polyreactivity, and (iii) mammalian cell display to select developable mAbs.",

Display technologies, on the other hand, can easily provide antibodies against nonimmunogenic or highly toxic targets, and careful selection procedures can direct binding to specific epitopes, conformations, isoforms, or cross-reactivities. ][4] Phage libraries provide enormous initial diversity, while the ability to use fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) with yeast libraries affords tremendous versatility, allowing finetuning of specific binding properties after diversity has been reduced to a broadly binding population by a couple of rounds of phage display. 8][19][20][21][22][23][24] Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, scFvs are generally less stable, more prone to aggregation and more challenging to convert to full-length IgG, [25][26][27][28] while Fabs are larger molecules requiring two separate polypeptide chains to be precisely assembled with a disulfide bond, resulting in worse folding, decreased solubility, display and lower expression level in Escherichia coli (E. coli). 29 While over 100 phage-based antibody libraries have been described (see 9 for an overview), very few scFv 30 or Fab 27,31,32 libraries have been displayed on yeast, with yeast mating, rather than cloning, being the commonest way to generate diversity in Fab libraries.",

            "text": "Necitumumab was also isolated from de Haard and collaborators' library by using A431 carcinoma cells, which express high levels of EGFR. Competition with cetuximab for binding to the cell surface generated one clone, termed 11F8, which displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated EGFR activation in A431 cells. A comparison of the structures of Fab11F8 with the Fab derived from cetuximab (FabC225) both in complex with EGFR, indicated that the epitope of the two Fabs was remarkably similar, but the antibodies having different CDRs, bound EGFR through a set of different interactions (39). Necitumumab, the new fully human antibody was thus developed, had similar biological properties to cetuximab, but without the disadvantages of a chimeric antibody. \n\nUntil relatively recently, phage display technology was controlled by a few companies, holding their technology patents (102). These patents expired in Europe and the United States, thus, allowing the free use of the antibody discovery methodology via phage display by academic laboratories and small biotech organizations. As phage display technology has become a commodity, several companies such as BioRad using HuCAL \u00ae (103), Distributed Bio via SuperHuman synthetic libraries, 2 and GlobalBio/ADL by means of semi-synthetic ALTHEA Gold Libraries\u2122 3 are licensing phage display libraries and/or offering discovery services at a relatively low cost without royalty payments. \n\nIn addition to phage, other display platforms have been developed, including ribosome (104), bacteria (105), yeast (106), and mammalian (107) display. Each of these platforms has advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages of yeast display, which is the most commonly used, over phage display is the screening using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This advantage has proven to be an efficient means to isolate antibodies with very high affinity, e.g., in the low femtomolar range (108). In addition, while phage is limited to the display of antibody fragments such as scFvs or Fabs, yeast enables the display of full IgG antibodies with glycosylation.",

            "text": "An important parameter and perhaps the simplest one to be considered when building an antibody phage display library is its size, as it correlates with the probability of selecting higher affinity antibodies, as predicted by Perelson [34]. The libraries described in Table 1 reached the maximum possible size of \u224810 11 antibody variants. With these library sizes, diverse, highly specific, and sub-nM binders have been obtained from nearly all of the libraries, regardless of the antibody repertoire type, be it na\u00efve, synthetic, or semisynthetic. The effective size of the libraries was on average 85%, meaning that there is room for a 15% improvement, assuming a 100% functionality could be reached. A 15% improvement in a repertoire of 10 11 molecules implies 1.5 \u00d7 10 10 additional antibody variants to select from. \n\nTo improve the effective size of the libraries, better DNA synthesis methods can be applied to increase the percentage of ORFs by reducing stop codons, frameshifts, and redundant and/or unwanted amino acids in the targeted positions for diversification. Current synthesis platforms, such as Twist Bioscience's silicon-based DNA synthesis platform, enables the precise synthesis of variants with a uniform incorporation of variants in each library, as validated by next-generation sequencing (https://www.twistbioscience.com/libraries_poster_precisionsynthesis). This precise synthesis method can be combined with libraries of antibody molecules with an enhanced developability profile. This can be done by incorporating better developability prediction methods in the design phase of the libraries. In this regard, new in silico tools [89] can identify antibody sequences that have anomalous developability values compared with therapeutics antibodies. This metric, called therapeutic antibody profiling (TAP), builds a downloadable structural model of an antibody V sequence and tests it against guideline thresholds of five calculated measures likely to be linked to poor developability. Therefore, by generating each possible variant of an antibody library in silico and filtering out those with poor TAP, non-developable variants can be replaced with developable ones.",

            "title": "High Affinity, Developability and Functional Size: The Holy Grail of Combinatorial Antibody Library Generation",
            "text": "Until the invention of phage display, immunization and murine hybridoma technology were the only methods available for the generation of antibodies. Hybridoma technology however has its limitations when the antigens are toxic or non-immunogenic in mice. More importantly, however, generation of antibodies to self-antigens can be challenging, especially when there are high sequence homologies between the human and the respective murine antigen. In vitro antibody selection methods, such as phage display, have set a new standard. An important advantage of these antibody generation technologies is the absence of technical limitations, such as the choice of antigen and the ability to tailor both affinities and cross-reactivities to what is required. The past decades have seen a rapid development of large antibody repertoires and display methods, namely phage display, ribosomal display and bacterial, yeast or mammalian cell surface display. Today a multitude of antibody libraries exists that differ both in design and means of construction. The focus of this review will be on antibody libraries developed to isolate therapeutic antibodies. It is in the nature of the subject that commercial libraries play a major part. \n\nOne of the greatest challenges in library selection as compared to in vivo methods is the absence of somatic hypermutation (SHM) which enables nature to create high-affinity antibodies. Different affinity maturation strategies are available to overcome this limitation. All of these methods are based on introducing a certain degree of diversity into selected, moderate affinity candidates, followed by repeated selection with increased selective pressure. Affinities that can be achieved directly from a combinatorial library, without affinity maturation, are expected to correlate, to a certain degree, with the size of the library. The probability of identifying high-affinity antibodies thus increases with library size [please refer to 1]. Functional library size, however, matters more than absolute library size and this can vary dramatically depending on the design and means of construction. \n\nAnother major challenge of in vitro selection methods is to deliver therapeutic antibodies that are developable and safe in human. Developability encompasses several different aspects of a therapeutic antibody: production, manufacturability, formulation interactions as well as the resulting shelf life. These parameters influence the costs of goods, but more importantly, affect dosing, modes of administration and can have an impact on drug safety.",

            "text": "When using invitro display, one of the concerns is that the total diversity of antibodies found in these libraries may not be fully tapped during selections. Theoretical 5 and experimental 6,7 assessments indicate that one would expect to recover thousands of different antibodies from a10 8 diversity library, and yet, unless heroic efforts are made, 8 the number of antibodies identified is usually less than 50. This is mainly due to two factors:1) many antibody libraries are not as diverse as indicated by the number of transformants, 9,10 and2) the way potential binders are traditionally screened identifies leads after extensive individual clone screening, an inefficient approach vexed by the redundancy of abundant clones, and sparse, or absent, representation of most clones that occur in lower frequencies within the selected population. Moreover, clones with high binding activity, or with other prominent functional properties, can be found within the lower frequency clone population. Their rarity can be explained by lower expression levels in aprokaryotic system, or by more general biases resulting from the biopanning process. 11 An alternative approach is to use next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has massively increased the capacity to sequence millions of clones in avery fast and inexpensive way, 12 revolutionizing several aspects of biological research, including invitro and invivo antibody selections. 10,13 e routinely use an approach that exploits NGS in invitro display selection analyses. By combining phage display, yeast display, and NGS, we have shown that the number of identified antibodies can exceed 1,000, 10,14,15 reflecting the far deeper sampling that NGS provides: millions of reads, rather than hundreds of microtiter plate wells screened. This is particularly true if there is bias in the selected population, which is often the case. However, unless antibodies identified by NGS can be easily produced as clones for further analysis, their specificities and properties cannot be assessed, leaving uncertain the true breadth of available reactivities, and risking the loss of many potentially valuable antibodies. The greater the number of different antibodies available, the greater the number of different epitopes, and consequently biological activities, that can be targeted. The caveat of NGS sequencing is that after identifying the desired sequences, one does not have the isolated clones in hand.",

            "text": "Phage display is a technology established for generating human monoclonal antibodies. This approach is an in vitro technology that confers the potential for generating antibodies from phage libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size while overcoming limitations of in vivo immunization [5,7] . With full-length purified GPC3 and the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 as antigens, we screened the Tomlinson I and J libraries and obtained specific antibody fragments 42A1 and I4A3, from each respectively. In this study, we successfully optimized affinities by in vitro assaying under different scenarios. Semi-synthetic libraries usually have combinations of natural and synthetic diversity. That is, they are often created to increase natural diversity while maintaining a certain level of functional diversity [20] . Although the semi-synthetic libraries, i.e., Tomlinson I and J libraries are sources of antibodies against a large number of different antigens, those antibodies normally exhibit only moderate affinity due to limited diversity [19][20] . Optimizing the CDR sequence in order to improve affinity has been validated by engineering antibodies against various antigens [22,34,[36][37][38] . Constructing a library of mutant variants in phage format provided a fast and convenient way to identify which potent binders bypass the protein purification process. \n\nThe choice of an affinity maturation strategy is related to both the magnitude of affinity increases and the probability of epitope conservation. Therefore, we first optimized antibody affinity by introducing a single site mutation in CDR. We felt this approach might have less chance of influencing epitope. Our results showed that T57H mutation in CDR-H2 of 42A1 and S98M mutation in CDR-H3 of I4A3 both brought 2-to 3-fold improvement in affinity. This suggests that the strategy implemented is feasible; however, we were unable to obtain the optimized variants from the original phage library. This might be due to the limited diversity in the Tomlinson I and J libraries. Additionally, the initial phage library may or may not contain antibody variants with point mutations for those selected.",

            "text": "Chairman: Andrew Bradbury, Research Scientist and Group Leader, Los Alamos National Laboratory \n\nThe two dominant display platforms (yeast and phage) were described almost twenty and thirty years ago, respectively, with both approaches now being used by numerous investigators to generate antibodies of clinical and research utility. In this session improvements in screening and selection approaches will be covered, as well as improved antibody scaffolds suitable for specific therapeutic targets. \n\nAndrew Bradbury (Los Alamos National Laboratory) will discuss the inherent problems of accessing the diversity present in display libraries. Theoretical and practical considerations would suggest that functional libraries should provide specific binders at the rate of approximately one binder per ten million clones. However, as libraries have grown exponentially larger, the number of isolated/identified binders has not increased correspondingly. By comparing the diversity of binders obtained from the same original na\u20ac \u0131ve antibody genetic material screened by: 1) phage display; 2) phage combined with yeast display; and 3) phage/yeast display with next-generation sequencing, this talk will illustrate how the diversity of isolated binders depends upon the screening/selection methods used. An alternative approach to traditional display technologies is the use of two hybrid methods, such as yeast two hybrid. Antonino Cattaneo (Scuola Normale Superiore) will describe the further development of this technology to select antibodies recognizing specific targets, particularly how it can be applied to the selection of antibodies against specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). This involves the anchored in vivo site-specific modification of a specific target, followed by the in vivo (yeast) selection of antibodies recognizing that modification. The selection of functional antibodies against acetylated and conformational targets will be described. One important advantage of this technique is that selected antibodies are functional within the cytoplasm. As a result, in addition to being able to inhibit PTM activity, selected antibodies tend to be particularly stable. \n\nThe B cell is the perfect display platform, providing both amplification and simultaneous affinity maturation upon immunization. However, it can be challenging to access the naturally paired genes underlying B cell responses to target. While rodents yield hybridomas relatively easily, this is not the case for humans.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become an integral part of modern treatment concepts for cancer, inflammation, immunological disorders, and infectious diseases. Fully human mAbs, carrying no xenogenic components and displaying most preferable pharmacokinetic profiles, have emerged as the fastest-growing group of therapeutic antibodies entering clinical trials. 1,2 Since the first report of the production of a mouse mAb through employment of B cell hybridoma fusion techniques, 3 several powerful technologies for the generation of entirely human antibodies have been developed. 4,5 These include noncombinatorial methodologies for the efficient immortalization of human B cells, 6,7 the generation of stable human hybridomas, 8 and expression-cloning of physiological variable (V) gene pairings from blood-derived human B cells of infected individuals. 9 The vast majority of clinically-investigated fully human mAbs, however, are produced by either immunization of transgenic mice that are equipped with the human antibody gene repertoire, 10,11 or by preparing human antibody phage display libraries. In the latter approach, random pairs of the variable genes of the heavy and light antibody chains (VH and VL, respectively) are cloned as combinatorial libraries involving bacteriophages for presentation of selectable antibody fragments. 12 Since the initial description of antibody phage display, 13 this technology has evolved into the most successful in vitro selection platform for human antibodies because it is robust, inexpensive, and offers great potential for automation. 14,15 The first fully human phage display-derived mAbs have recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatic and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (adalimumab), systemic lupus erythematosus (belimumab), and inhalational anthrax infection (raxibacumab). Other phage display library-selected mAbs are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years. \n\nOver the past 20 years, a plethora of phage-derived antibody libraries have been constructed that differ in design, origin, diversity, and method of generation. Nevertheless, depending on the gene sources employed, all antibody libraries can be grouped into na\u00efve, immune, and (semi-) synthetic libraries.",

            "text": "This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest. Alternatively, single large na\u00efve, 13 synthetic, 14,15 or semi-synthetic libraries (where synthetic diversity is combined with natural diversity) 12 have been shown to be capable of producing high affinity antibodies (K d < 10nM) to a wide range of structurally diverse antigens. The use of such libraries therefore eliminates the need for a specific library for a specific antigen and circumvents issues with immunological tolerance found with mouse immunization approaches. \n\nA critical feature of phage display is the ability to deplete libraries of binders to epitopes that are not of interest. Use of compounds (such as murine antibodies or non-specific enzyme inhibitors) that mask desirable binding sites on the target can be used to deplete libraries and thereby enrich for candidates likely to have desired biological activity (Fig. 2). For example, in the development of an active-site inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) the phage display library was first depleted by selecting with MMP-14 bound to its natural, active site inhibitor. 16 This depletion step eliminates the majority of antibodies that bind at sites other than the active site. Subsequent selection with active MMP-14 was then used to identify a highly specific candidate antibody that acted as a competitive inhibitor to the target site of interest. 3 Selection strategies can also be designed to remove candidates with vulnerability toward challenges such as proteolytic digestion or resistance to denaturation. 17 Moreover, the initial protein scaffold itself can be used to steer toward biological activity. For example, Kunitz domains are highly likely to bind the active site of serine proteases and have been used as a successful starting point to create a variety of specific protease inhibitors. 18 ][21] Another distinct advantage of using in vitro methods, such as phage display, for drug discovery is the ability to select for candidates that bind to both human and non-human targets. 3 Having a candidate that binds the mouse, rat or monkey orthologs of a human target simplifies preclinical tests of efficacy and toxicity, and can shorten development timelines.",

Once the antibody library is synthesized and displayed on phage particles [31][32][33] , the characteristics of the natural antibody repertoires can be queried with the phage display system. \n\nIn this work, the antigen recognition capabilities of the mouse antibody repertoires were validated by testing the functionality of a corresponding synthetic phage-displayed antibody library encoded with the CDR structural and sequence characteristics resembling those of the antibody repertoires from na\u00efve and immunized mice. NGS was applied to sample the antibody repertoire sequences obtained from the na\u00efve and immunized mice with extracellular domain (ECD) of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a model antigen. Computational analysis of the NGS data indicated that the antibody repertoires from na\u00efve mice and mice immunized with various immunization protocols are largely skewed toward a CDR canonical structure (CS) combination. A synthetic antibody library was constructed based on the structural and sequence characteristics of the mouse antibody repertoires and tested for HER2-specific antibody discovery. The synthetic antibody library was able to generate antibodies with equally high affinity and specificity as the affinity-matured antibodies from the mouse antibody repertoires. Moreover, the synthetic antibody library was also able to generate binders to all sorts of protein surface in addition to that of HER2/ECD. These results suggested that the predominant CDR canonical structure combination in mouse antibody repertoires is a robust framework capable of encoding highly functional antibodies against diverse protein antigens. The results also demonstrate the utilities of phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries in testing insights into natural antibody repertoires and in developing artificial antibody repertoires to discover highly functional antibodies targeting at various antigens on diverse epitopes.",

            "text": "The immune repertoire has become increasingly accessible through new methods that facilitate the enrichment, isolation or expansion of antigen-specific post-GC B cells, plasma blasts, plasma cells or memory B cells from peripheral blood. The development of these methods has been spurred by the discovery of endogenous human antibodies of potential therapeutic utility in normal human donors, as well as in those with inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. Endogenous human antibodies that are triggered Antibody libraries that are based on human na\u00efve repertoires but introduce additional sequence diversification through randomizing single or multiple CDR sequences represent, by definition, human synthetic repertoires; [147][148][149][150] however, not all synthetic repertoires are based on randomized CDR sequences. Using master framework sequences derived from a single human V H and V l gene segment, S\u00f6derlind et al. 151 introduced and recombined a complete set of CDR sequences derived by RT-PCR from human na\u00efve repertoires. Yet another approach of sequence diversification in vitro is based on dispersing mutations throughout heavy and light chain variable domain sequences, as opposed to focusing mutations on defined segments such as CDR sequences. This can be achieved through error-prone PCR or mutagenic Escherichia coli strains. Like focused mutagenesis, dispersed mutagenesis has been utilized for the affinity (or catalytic activity) maturation of human mAbs, usually by phage display 152,153 and, more recently, by yeast display. 115,154 wing to the fact that the discussed antibody libraries blend in vivo and in vitro diversity, they are sometimes referred to as semi-synthetic. By contrast, fully synthetic antibody libraries are entirely designed and engineered in vitro. A fully synthetic antibody library that combined a single human V H and V k gene segment with randomized HCDR3 and LCDR3 sequences was mined successfully for human mAbs to human antigens. 155 urther restrictions that mimic natural CDR sequence diversity in the heavy chain variable domain and use a fixed light chain variable domain yielded human mAbs that closely resemble endogenous human antibodies. These were improved further by introducing natural CDR sequence diversity in the light chain variable domain. 156,157",

            "text": "Combinatorial antibody phage display technologies provide robust means for the rapid discovery of tumor antigen antibodies [13]. It is easy to implement and inexpensive. Numerous academic and industrial laboratories have adopted the technique and contributed to its advancement. The methods for design, construction and screening of synthetic antibody libraries are constantly being improved and semi-automated selection strategies have been proposed. The advantage of antibody phage display is the direct isolation of fully human antibodies in comparison to antibodies generated by mouse hybridoma technology where a laborious humanization procedure of the lead candidates is required. Many products of phage display are now reaching the Biopharmaceutical market. Monoclonal antibodies had been the standard as anticancer agents by modulating intrinsic tumor cell pathways and activating the innate immune response against cancer cells. Phage display derived human antibodies obviously can compete with earlier generation products as long as they are directed to well defined targets such as the EGFR or VEGF pathway. Phage display plays an important role in drug discovery and development with a number of molecules approved by FDA and many others in clinical trials. It is normal to expect that greater improvement will be made in the near future and phage display will bring many more contributions to oncology.",

            "text": "However, the antibody screening step of the phage display method is faster and cheaper (Hentrich et al., 2018). \n\nThe first antibody discovered by phage display (CAT library) as well as the first human antibody approved for therapy was adalimumab (Humira\u00ae) (Fig. 1) (Burmester et al., 2013). It is an IgG1 mAb that binds tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and prevents the interaction of this inflammatory cytokine with the corresponding receptor. Having been discovered from an scFv phage library, gene manipulation was needed to obtain the final IgG format (Machold and Smolen, 2003). This antibody has been used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, among other autoimmune diseases. \n\nAlthough the phage display library is a promising technology for the development of antibodies, it has limitations. The diversity of the phage library depends on the bacterial transformation efficiency and is limited to the 10 10 -10 11 variant antibody maximum repertoire of the phage display library. This restriction can be overcome by mRNA and ribosome display strategies, which are in vitro cell-free methods having a bigger library size and a higher displayed antibody diversity (10 14 variants) (Hudson and Souriau, 2003;Kunamneni et al., 2020). It should be also considered that phage display-selected mAbs are generated in E. coli and therefore are not glycosylated; the use of eukaryotic display platforms, like yeast (Doerner et al., 2014) and mammalian expression systems (Zhu and Hatton, 2017), is a possibility to circumvent that. Other antibody phage display methodology disadvantages are the propensity to generate biased repertoires and the loss of information of antibody natural pairing (Saggy et al., 2012) (Table 1).",

            "text": "In vitro display and selection technologies like phage display are commonly used methods to generate recombinant human antibodies against a panel of target antigens for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications [15][16][17][18]. In general, there are three main types of antibody libraries, namely the na\u00efve, synthetic, and immune antibody libraries [19]. The main difference between these libraries is the origin of the antibody repertoire used to construct the library [6]. Na\u00efve library repertoires are mainly made up of naturally unskewed repertoires that provide an attractive source of repertoire diversity. Synthetic library repertoires are similar to na\u00efve libraries in terms of diversity. However, the source of repertoire differs as the repertoire is generated by synthetic oligonucleotides that are typically randomized at defined positions in the CDR region of the antibody. On the other hand, immune libraries are generated from a specialized repertoire as the antibody genes are obtained from B-lymphocytes isolated from infected patients of a particular disease. This in turn results in a skewed preference of antibodies and a preferential gene usage. In terms of lymphatic filariasis, a direct comparison of antibodies against parasitic antigens like BmR1 has never been reported. A direct comparison would allow a better understanding of the antibody gene usage preference in correlation to the binding ability against a specific target antigen. \n\nGenerally, immune libraries are used to generate high-affinity antibodies against antigens of a specific disease due to the skewed antibody repertoires [20]. However, this may not be a feasible prospect for many researchers since new libraries need to be constructed for every different antigen. Therefore, na\u00efve libraries are preferred instead of immune libraries for the isolation of antibodies against multiple antigens. Even so, the impact and benefits of immune libraries in antibody generation should not be neglected. This is because antibodies derived from immune libraries tend to present higher affinity clones in comparison to na\u00efve libraries due to their skewed nature [21]. Therefore, a direct comparison to highlight the functionality and repertoire diversity of the clones derived from the immune libraries will offer a deeper understanding of the repertoire diversity of immune libraries. \n\nThe data show the ability of both immune and na\u00efve libraries to generate scFv clones that bind to the BmR1 antigen.",

            "text": "D isplay technologies are powerful tools in protein drug discovery and have been widely applied to select antibodies and alternative scaffold proteins from synthetic libraries. 1,2 Phage display antibody libraries with diversities approaching 10 11 have been constructed for enriching the target binding clones by biopanning. Typically, after the initial selection by panning, additional labor-intensive screening of large numbers of individual library members is required to identify clones with the desired affinity and specificity. 3,4 aradoxically, even with a limited number of clones, the postselection screening consumes more time and resources than the primary screening of repertoires of billions of members by panning selection. This post-selection screening is routinely performed in 96-well microtiter plates using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), either directly with phage display clones or in a format with soluble protein for more precise characterization. 5 Screening by phage ELISA requires 10\u221225 \u03bcg of protein in a 96-or 384-well microtiter plate. 6,7 By contrast, only 500 ng of the target protein (coating a single microtiter well) is sufficient for one round of panning with 10 12 antibody-displaying phages. 7 Thus, approximately 20\u221250-fold more target protein is needed for the characterization of just one library member compared to the actual primary selection. For targets that are difficult-to-express or synthesize, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 8 and marine ciguatoxins 9 the availability of the antigen may severely limit the extent of screening experiments. Miniaturization and multiplexing the primary screening effort would lead to considerable savings in time and material. \n\nAs a result of their high multiplexing capacity and low sample volume requirements, suspension bead arrays (SBA) have become a popular choice in medical research, e.g., for cytokine 10 and allergen testing. 11 SBAs typically consist of microbeads that are encoded with different ratios of organic fluorophores, creating a collection of unique spectral bead \"addresses\". 12 A test panel for multiple biomarkers is obtained by conjugating each batch of address beads with a different capture antibody.",

            "text": "Gauhar et al. (35), used type 2 nurse shark VNAR semi-synthetic libraries generated by overlap PCR, with variable CDR3 lengths, incorporating randomization of this region by NNK codons (36). In their work, Ubah et al. (34) screened a synthetic VNAR library, constructed by combining na\u00efve VNAR frameworks, different CDR3 lengths, generating diversity within the CDR1 and CDR3 and incorporating some non-canonical cysteine residues into CDR1 and CDR3. Valdovinos-Navarro et al. (40) screened three previously reported horn shark VNAR synthetic libraries (41) constructed by Kunkel Mutagenesis, each with a different CDR3 length, as well as different numbers of cysteines in this region, including sequence diversity only within the CDR3 by NNK codons. When new pathogens emerge and spread in an unexpected and very fast way as in the case of SARS-CoV-2, synthetic antibody libraries can offer a fast and reliable source for the search for neutralizing antibodies because the selection of sdAbs from a synthetic library requires 2-3 weeks, whereas generation of sdAbs from immunized libraries needs at least 4 months from animal immunization to antibody selection. This is highlighted by the fact that the first studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 VNARs used synthetic libraries for screening. Even so, many works tend to continue betting on the safe side, with the construction and screening of immune libraries, specific for the target antigen. In addition to the use of immune and synthetic libraries, Buffington et al. ( 44) used a na\u00efve VNAR library constructed from peripheral blood leukocytes from six non-immunized adult nurse sharks (45). Buffington et al. propose the shark VNAR phage display libraries as a promising platform for the rapid isolation of sdAbs with therapeutic potential. \n\nSeveral antibody surface display technologies exist, including ribosome display, yeast surface display, bacterial surface display, and phage display. It has been reported that camelid sdAbs against SARS-CoV-2 have been isolated using display technologies other than phage display.",

But, several technical challenges are associated with the selection process. For instance, during the panning step, the successful elution of the phages bound to the antigen is critical in order to avoid losing the most promising binders. Here, we present an efficient protocol to establish, screen and select synthetic libraries of domain antibodies using phage display. We do not only present suitable solutions to the above-mentioned challenges to improve elution by 50-fold, but we also present a step by step in-depth protocol with miniaturized volumes and optimized procedures to save material, costs and time for a successful phage display with domain antibodies. Hence, this protocol improves the selection process for an efficient handling process. The here presented library is based on the variable domain (vNAR) of the naturally occurring novel antibody receptor (IgNAR) from cartilage fishes. Diversity was introduced in the Complementarity-Determining Region 3 (CDR3) of the antigen-binding site with different composition and length.",

            "text": "they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of immune phage display libraries for the identification of functional and diverse scFv fragments. As 5% of the immunoglobulin repertoire in rodents expresses the lambda light chain, we have considered the kappa chain locus only. 31 We analyzed data from two immune libraries against CD160 and CD123 based on HCDR3 abundance within the enriched libraries, and selected clones either based on frequency or phylogenetic distance to allow the isolation of more diverse binders. An interesting observation was that not all clones enriched by phage display panning bound to target antigen, but we observed a success rate of 75% and 81% when we analyzed the most frequent clones prevalent after CD160 and CD123 selection, respectively. This strategy consists of conventional phage display biopanning followed by SMRT sequencing and open source NGS analysis to identify an expansive repertoire of antigen-specific antibody clones, with virtually no screening required. A disadvantage of the system deployed here, relative to second-generation systems such as the Illumina platform, is the far lower sequencing depth obtained. Typically yields of 80,000 reads for a 1 Kb sequence fragment can be generated, as compared to over 5 \u00d7 10 6 reads for Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Clearly, the read depths obtained in our experiments were insufficient to cover the theoretical diversity of a typical phage display library. It is possible to modify the sequencing protocol by sequencing the same prepared library on multiple SMRT cells of the sequencer. As library preparation and instrument run time are a substantial proportion of the sequencing cost, this approach could enable sequencing depth to be increased 10-fold with a modest increase in sequencing costs. For the purpose of this study and using an approach in which libraries are first enriched against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have",

This first generation of natural or na\u00efve repertoires contained the diversity harvested from the total B-cell repertoire by RT-PCR and thus suffered from a lack of control over FR usage and mutation rate (Sidhu and Fellouse, 2006). This can be a significant issue in antibody therapeutic development, as not all human FRs are used at high frequency in the B-cell repertoire (see above) and, importantly, not all will express well in heterologous systems or be stable in delivery formulations (Ewert et al., 2003). Additionally, antibodies from na\u00efve libraries may contain somatic mutations leading to FR or CDR based T-cell epitopes and/or aggregation-prone sequences that could potentially lead to immunogenicity (Harding et al., 2010). As a result, several research groups have developed fully synthetic antibody repertoires in which a few well-expressed and well-behaved scaffolds are used for the repertoire synthesis and diversity is restricted to the CDRs (Pini et al., 1998;Sidhu et al., 2004).",

In the field of antibody discovery, it mimics the in vivo process of antibody generation and has four main characteristics: (1) the generation of the genotypic diversity by library construction, (2) the linkage between the genotype and the phenotype, (3) the recovery of the DNA sequence encoding the selected antibody and finally (4) the antibody amplification. The isolated clones can be expressed to be characterized and the best candidates are selected [14] (Figure 1C). Further characterizations can be performed by IgG production in mammalian cells. Antibody libraries can be derived from either non-immunized (na\u00efve and synthetic) or immunized donors. Na\u00efve libraries should have high diversity, but the selected clones may not have high affinity. On the other hand, libraries from immunized donors have a lower diversity with higher affinity candidates [37,38]. \n\nThe main advantage of this technology is the capability to select antibodies against a wide range of targets and epitopes since the selection from a na\u00efve or synthetic antibody repertoire does not rely on an in vivo immune response. Thus, the isolation of antibodies targeting even self-antigens and toxic, unstable, and non-immunogenic antigens is possible using the library from non-immunized donors [14]. \n\nPhage, yeast and mammalian cell surface displays are examples of in vitro display technologies to select antibody fragments such as the single-chain variable fragment (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and single-domain antibody (sdAb) [37][38][39]. \n\nPhage display was the first technology developed to select exogenous peptides on the filamentous M13 bacteriophage (phage) surface with specific binding properties by Smith et al. in 1985 [40]. Antibody phage display was developed by McCafferty and colleagues five years later [41].",

Concurrent evolution of the libraries has allowed display and selection technologies to reveal their full potential. They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design.",

The two principal technologies for the isolation of human antibodies are in vitro display methods, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display, and \"humanized\" mice, i.e., transgenic mice modified to contain genomic regions containing the human humoral immune systems. \n\nDisplay technologies enable high-diversity libraries containing antibody variable region fragments to be screened against a target antigen. Phage display is perhaps the most common technique and involves the display of antibody fragments derived from immunoglobulin gene libraries on the surface of fd filamentous phage, followed by antigen-driven selection. 15,16 The linking of phenotype (displayed antibody) with genotype (the gene encoding the antibody is harboured in the phagemid within the phage particle) allows the isolation of specific antibodies and subsequent rescue of the gene encoding the antibody. This technique has allowed the isolation of antibodies to a wide range of targets and epitopes that may not have been possible using traditional in vivo immunisation. 17 Fragments isolated by display technologies can easily be reformatted into whole immunoglobulin backbones in a high-throughput and sequence independent matter. 18 Even though phage display technology was established more than 20 years ago and despite the widespread use in early stage antibody discovery, to date only two approved antibody products have been created via phage display. These antibodies are adalimumab (Humira \u00ae , Abbott), approved in 2002, which is used in treatment of autoimmune disorders, and belimumab (BENLYSTA \u00ae , Human Genome Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline), approved in 2011 as the first new treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus in 56 years. \n\nMore recently, exciting developments have been made in the area of yeast display technologies. This includes technology developed by Adimab that involves modification of published yeast display methods. 19,20 This methodology enables rapid screening of antigens against high-diversity libraries (exceeding 10 14 ) and from the Wellcome Trust and the technology is available under license to both academic and commercial operations.",

            "text": "Initial molecular discovery techniques did not involve the use of labelled libraries, and instead relied on the synthesis and individual storage of unique compounds. A limitation in the size of available molecular libraries was, for a significant period, one of the major bottlenecks to new molecule discovery [39]. The advent of HTC techniques has now allowed for the creation of unlabelled chemical libraries of up to 3 million individually stored compounds. To screen these libraries in vitro, each molecule must be examined individually in separate reactions against targets to assess activity. Whilst this process is lengthy and inefficient if performed by hand, the speed of this has been significantly increased by high-throughput screening (HTS). This technology is the use of highly efficient automated robotic platforms to screen each library compound one-by-one against a target in high multiplicity multi-well plates [40][41][42]. HTS is essentially a brute-force solution to the lengthy wet lab procedure, but is still used frequently, particularly for chemical library screening. \n\nDeveloped by George Smith in 1985, phage display has been one of the driving technologies for the discovery of new antibodies and peptides through labelled molecular library screening [26]. It is one of the original efficient methods for linking a molecular phenotype with its descriptive genotype, which allows for the identification and characterisations of a molecule isolated from a library of molecules during library screening. Phage display is the cloning of a desired variable DNA sequence, either of a peptide [25] or antibody fragment [26,43,44], into the positive-sense ssDNA genome of filamentous bacteriophage, where it is expressed as a protein fusion to one of the M13 bacteriophage coat proteins (generally pIII). These genetically linked molecular libraries can be divided into na\u00efve, immune, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries, depending on the origin of the displayed molecules. Non-immunised and immunised animals provide the source for na\u00efve and immune libraries for antibody or antibody fragment display, respectively, whereas semi-synthetic libraries are sequences modified from animal or human donors.",

            "text": "Phage display library may be constructed using any of the above-mentioned phage display systems and screened to obtain the most promising binders exhibiting strongest affinity for the target molecule/pathogen for use in diagnostics and immunotherapy. Either randomly generated fragments of targeted pathogen DNA or synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts are cloned into the phage genome leading to generation of Natural peptide library (NPL) or Random peptide library (RPL), respectively. NPLs are more likely to mount an antibody response that cross-reacts with the native intact pathogen but a vast majority of clones in these libraries are non-functional, whereas RPLs have extended range of displayed epitopes [37,38]. When the engineered nucleotide fragments of immunoglobulins encoding the antigen-binding region are displayed, it leads to generation of antibody phage display (APD) library. Antibody expression over the phage surface is a powerful platform that allows the selection of specific antibodies when either immunized patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. Due to the vast applications of this important technique, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for developing and applying the phage display technique for the discovery and isolation of antibodies [1,39,40]. Major advantages of antibody phage display include as follows: production of large-sized combinatorial libraries, improved efficiency than conventional hybridoma system, easy manipulation, safety, no involvement of animal cell culture, lower propagative cost and easy screening procedures involved to select target specific binders [41][42][43]. Specifically for viral pathogens, antibody phage display is an alternative tool to hybridoma technology, since it circumvents the limitations of the immune system [44].\n\nThe antibody phage display technique was first described using gene III protein of E. coli filamentous phages and was further modified. The display formats include single-chain fragment variable (scFv), antigen-binding fragment (Fabs), single-chain fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), variable domains of heavy chain (VHHs)-also called as nanobodies, immunoglobu",

            "text": "The main struggle in traditional methods is the development of fully human mAbs to apply in therapeutics and consequently, several efforts have been endeavored to overcome this problem. The debut of recombinant DNA technology together with progress of in vitro technologies provided several new and powerful ways that lead to the development of the phage display technology to create therapeutic antibodies. This ground breaking technology was introduced in 1985 by Smith [107] centered on the selection of a particular phenotype (e.g., a ligand specific to a target antigen) from repertoires of molecules displayed on phages. In 1990, McCafferty and colleagues demonstrated that the display of antibody fragments on phages was conceivable through the use of vectors to introduce antibody DNA into phage genomes, thus combining genotype and phenotype in one phage particle [117,124]. The concept behind this display technology is that a large library of potentially interesting antibodies is created, from which antibody fragments with desirable specificity and affinity can be selected against a specific antigen [125]. The use of phage libraries carrying human Ig genes-antibody display libraries was one of the most successful applications of this approach [125].\n\nFor the construction of an antibody library, the repertoire of V-genes encoding antibodies from B cells is amplified via PCR using a set of specific primers covering all the V gene families. Subsequently the antibody fragments are generated by random combination of VL and VH chain genes [126,127]. Based on the origin of antibody genes, the libraries can be categorized into natural or synthetic. Furthermore, natural source repertoire libraries can be either naive or immune. Naive libraries are derived from non-immunized donors of B cells, and immune libraries are derived from different kinds of immunized animals, human patients with a certain disease or previously exposed [75]. Additionally, several formats of antibody fragments, most commonly Fab and scFv can be cloned and displayed on phage libraries [128]. Once created the repertoire of antibody fragments, this heterogeneous mixture of phage clones is then screened by an affinity selection process called panning, during which the phage populations are presented to specific targets in order to select specific target-binding phages ( Figure 6). The antigen of interest is immobilized on a solid support and",

Similarly, Throsby et al., using combinatorial display libraries constructed from human memory B cells elicited by seasonal influenza vaccination, isolated 13 antibodies exhibiting broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes (84). The most potent antibody was also protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge and the epitope was localized to the highly conserved Therapeutic antibodies from phage display 653 membrane-proximal stem of the HA1 and HA2 subunits of hemagglutinin (84,85). \n\nUsing a combination of panning strategies against the hemagglutinin from several antigenically distinct H5N1 isolates to bias-selection of antibodies towards more conserved domains of the protein, we were able to isolate similar antibodies to that described by Throsby et al. from a non-immune Fab phage display library (11). The selection of such antibodies from even non-immune phage displayed libraries highlights the potential of these readily available libraries for the development of therapeutically relevant antibodies against emerging pathogens of high concern and may enable more rapid development of therapies against novel emergent pathogens in the future.",

            "text": "Renowned for their unique structural and functional attributes, nanobodies are single polypeptide chains that retain the antigenbinding capabilities of conventional antibodies [26,27]. One remarkable feature of nanobodies is their compact size, comprising only the variable domain without the additional heavy or light chains. This simplicity grants nanobodies several advantages, including enhanced tissue penetration, increased stability, and the ability to recognize cryptic epitopes that might be challenging for larger antibodies. The absence of a light chain also simplifies production and engineering processes. The selection process from nanobody libraries often involves immunizing animals with the target antigen of interest, followed by the generation of the library and subsequent panning against the antigen. Additionally, synthetic or na\u00efve nanobody libraries can be created without prior immunization, providing a valuable resource for discovering binders against a wide range of targets [28]. \n\nIn addition, chimeric phage display libraries are a hybrid class of libraries that incorporate genetic material from multiple sources, combining elements to enhance the diversity and functionality of displayed peptides or proteins. The construction of chimeric libraries involves the fusion of genetic sequences derived from different antibody fragments or protein domains, resulting in a mosaic-like collection of variants presented on the surface of bacteriophages [29]. These libraries aim to harness the strengths of different antibody formats or functional domains to create molecules with optimized properties. One common strategy for constructing chimeric libraries is the fusion of variable regions from human antibodies with constant regions from non-human sources, such as mice. This chimerization process seeks to retain the specificity and affinity of human antibodies while benefiting from the stability and expression advantages offered by non-human constant regions. Chimeric libraries can also be generated by combining variable domains from different antibodies, allowing for the exploration of diverse binding specificities within a single library [30]. \n\nIn another way, phage display antibody libraries can be classified into four distinct types based on the origin of their sequences: naive, immune, semi-synthetic, and synthetic libraries [31,32]. Naive libraries, sourced from natural entities such as primary B-cells of non-immunized donors, harness naturally rearranged variable region genes. With extensive repertoires reaching up to 10 11 members, naive libraries have the capacity to generate antibodies targeting a diverse array of antigens.",

            "text": "Synthetic libraries are used for scientific research and antibody discovery with advantages in terms of short production cycles and low costs. To improve screening efficiency, many high-throughput screening techniques have been developed, such as yeast or bacterial two-hybrid techniques, and screening of mammalian cells or yeast surface display techniques by flow cytometry (Suzuki et al., 2018;Carrara et al., 2022). However, library construction using phage display techniques is still the dominant method for screening target antibodies (Yan et al., 2014;Ferrari et al., 2020). The library used in this study was a shark-derived phage display library, and we introduced diversity in the CDR3 region of the library by NNK. Nbs of >95% purity were obtained using Ni-column purification, with yields of 8.6 mg/L and 2.35 mg/L for NC81 and NC89, respectively. Compared with other studies, our method may be more practical in terms of protein yield and production cost. The binding affinity of the Nbs isolated from the immune library generally ranges from 10 6 to 10 12 M -1 (Coppieters et al., 2006;Plagmann et al., 2009). CD93 binding and affinity assays indicate that NC81 and NC89 are within the range of affinity and have some binding capacity for CD93 protein. In addition, Nbs maintained their structural stability and their ability to bind antigens at high temperatures as measured by ELISA and CD spectroscopy. In future studies, mutation strategies for the CDR2 and CDR1 regions will be attempted to further improve the diversity of the library and the affinity of the Nbs. \n\nWe also investigated the potential anti-angiogenic activity in vitro. First, NC81 and NC89 were able to directly inhibit proliferation, migration, and tube formation on Matrigel by HUVECs. In addition, regulation of vascular permeability is essential for dynamic homeostasis between tissues and organs and facilitates increased transmission of macromolecular drugs as well as immune cells.",

One more advantage of this technology is the absence of laboratory animal use, the relative simplicity of the protocols, and the possibility of screening a large amount of candidate molecules in a short period of time. A very important feature is the possibility of selecting antibodies against a wide range of antigens, including toxic substances or highly dangerous viruses, which cannot be used for immunization because of ethical reasons. Phage display technology has proved its effectiveness in the development of therapeutic antibodies. In recent years, more than 14 antibodies on the u.S. pharmaceutical market have been obtained using phage display methods [15]. All these facts explain the interest of large companies, such as Morphosys GmbH (Germany; http://www.morphosys. com); cambridge Antibody technology (united Kingdom; http://www.catplc.co.uk), Dyax (uSA; http://www.dyax. com) and others, in the development and application of antibody fragment phage display libraries.",

            "text": "In vitro display technologies enable fast selection of antibodies with desired properties (e.g., specific binding activity) from a highly diverse antibody library. The high diversity, which is derived from shuffling natural V H -V L pairs or mutagenesis, enhances the possibility of finding potent clones in the libraries. Additionall y, the association between the genotype and phenotype of clones in display systems allows for clone screening based on phenotype and, thereby, identification of the selected clones by genotype. 1 Among the available in vitro display technologies, phage display is widely used due to the high transformation capacit y of phages and robustness of the process. [2][3][4] For example, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved human monoclonal antibody, adalimumab, was discovered t\\ough phage display. 5 Since the approval of adalimumab in 2002, many antibodies have been discovered and engineered through phage display, some of which have already been commercialized for clinical use. 6 In phage display-based antibody discovery, a phage display library composed of diverse clones is constructed, and then clones with binding activity to a target antigen in the library are enriched through a binding activity-based enrichment method, i.e., biopanning. After several rounds of biopanning, the enriched clones are identified and retrieved for further characterization. In this identification and retrieval step, to increase the possibility to discover prominent lead antibodies, it is essential to retrieve many clones with distinct biochemical properties. These biochemical properties can be predicted by identifying the nucleotide sequence of the enriched clones. As a representative example, the number of binding epitopes targeted by the identified clones can be estimated by analyzing the distribution of the length and amino acid sequence of the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3). 7,8 However, in most cases, few major clones are identified because dominant clones usually outnumber rare clones and make the selected pool of clones relatively homogeneous. Clones with prominent properties can exist in rare populations, but can be lost due to technical limitations. Also, clones with high binding activity to a target antigen can exist in a rare population in a library, due to the bias that results from the biopanning. 9 This was shown in our",

            "text": "One of the most widely utilized synthetic platforms is phage display, which relies on genetic encoding and expression of the variable regions of an immune receptor (as a fusion to viral capsid protein), thus providing a phenotype-genotype linkage (Smith, 1985). The displayed variable domains when derived from a BCR/ antibody can either be in an scFv format in which the VL and VH domains are connected via a peptide linker or in a fragment antigen-binding (Fab) format, which consists of the variable and the first constant domain of each light and heavy chain. In the context of a TCR, direct display is challenging due to low stability and expression of a soluble TCR, thus the most common format uses disulfide-bond-linked TCRs (dsTCRs) in which additional disulfide bonds increase the stability (Boulter et al., 2003) or the scTCR format in which the alpha and beta chain are connected via a peptide linker. One of the main advantages of phage display over other synthetic platforms is the ability to create very large recombinant libraries of up to 10 11 variants. These libraries are constructed either from natural immune repertoires (e.g., infected patients or immunized animals) or synthetic repertoires via different mutagenesis and DNA synthesis approaches. Phage libraries are screened via biopanning, which involves the addition of the library to immobilized antigen, washing out unbound phage variants, and finally eluting bound phages. The bound phages are then amplified and subjected to multiple rounds of panning to enrich for antigen-specific phage. The introduction of immune repertoire sequencing in the phage display screening process gives valuable insights, guides the selection process, and improves library design (Barreto et al., 2019;Dias-Neto et al., 2009;Glanville et al., 2015;Ravn et al., 2010). Deep sequencing of panning rounds has uncovered that many high-affinity binding clones become depleted due to fitness costs and that enriched clones identified can exhibit higher antigen selectivity (Ravn et al., 2010;Saggy et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2010).",

The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components.

In none of these was it possible to definitively eliminate sequence liabilities. This is the first report of a semi-synthetic library architecture where all CDR diversity corresponds to natural CDRs and sequence-based liabilities are removed from 5 of the 6 CDRs. \n\nHigh affinity, improved developability and broad diversity have been described as together defining the \"holy grail\" for next-generation antibody libraries. 65 Many of the published libraries described above are of comparable size (number of transformants) and the best among them have delivered some antibodies with comparable affinities to those described in this work. However, we show that by removing sequence liabilities from CDRs and selecting scaffolds derived from therapeutic antibodies, it is possible to routinely obtain both high affinity and highly developable antibodies directly from selections, results expected to close the gap between antibodies generated in vitro and in vivo. 59,66 chieving clinical success with an antibody depends on many different factors beyond the intrinsic properties of the molecule being tested. 67 In most cases it is not possible to determine whether an antibody failed a clinical trial due to poor developability given the data currently available. Poorly developable antibodies should show abnormal behavior in earlier development stages, such as pre-clinical and formulation (e.g., a polyspecific antibody may show faster than normal clearance in pre-clinical studies), 66 and it is clear that the proportion of poorly developable antibodies decreases with clinical stage and approval (Suppl.",

The preparation and screening of nanobodies are commonly used in a phage display library (40), which contains three library types: Natural, immune, and synthetic (91,92). The natural library is formed by amplifying the variable region genes of heavy chain antibodies from camel peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes that have not yet been immunized, then these variable region genes are recombined into phagemid vectors, and transformed into host bacteria to form antibody libraries (93,94). The immune library is an antibody library obtained by immunizing an alpaca or camel with an antigen protein, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the camel to amplify the variable region gene of the heavy chain antibody, and then recombining this variable region gene into a phagemid vector (94). The capacity of the immune library is lower than that of natural libraries, but numerous functional antibodies in the library recognize specific antigens for immunity, making screening of high-affinity antibodies a reality. For the construction of synthetic libraries (95), a certain VHH framework (such as cAbBcIll0) is generally selected as the backbone structure. Trinucleotide cassettes are used as a unit of raw materials to generate cdRs sequences. Then, the dNA of each region of VHH is assembled by PcR to form a complete VHH gene. The gene is cloned into a phagemid vector and transformed into an E. coli TG1 cell to form a library. The synthetic library, as an artificial library constructed by genetic engineering technology, has a great complementary role in the immune libraries and natural libraries and is an important source for screening high-affinity antibodies, with significant importance for the development of antibody drugs (91,95). \n\nThe phage display technology is used to screen binders for various targets from diverse and large libraries and is widely employed by various research teams.",

Since primary B cells will not propagate readily ex vivo, transformation is necessary to maintain the cells in culture for longer periods of time; therefore, the number of cells that are transformed limits the size and diversity of a B-cell library. 7][18] Using the novel antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of a simple organisms, such as phage, bacteria or yeast. These in vitro technologies, which we refer to as first generation technologies, have advanced the field of therapeutic antibody discovery, but they also have disadvantages. The largest of the phage display libraries comprises approximately 10 billion human antibodies, the sequences of which are derived from analysis of naturally occurring human gene sequences. 10,11 Utilizing phage expression allows for many antibody variations to be screened at once and those that bind are identified and isolated with relative ease. The disadvantage of the phage display system is that the library does not consist of full-length antibodies; the sequences, are based on human sequences as opposed to being actual human sequences and the proteins are expressed by bacteria (prokaryotic organism) rather than human cells. Displaying antibodies or antibody fragments on a eukaryote such as yeast allows for some post-translational modifications to the antibodies that do not occur in prokaryotes; however, the modifications may differ from human. 12 Phage and yeast display technologies have proved successful for identifying antibodies generated from human genes, but, due to differences in the expression and post-translational modification machinery in the bacterial and yeast cells, they may not be optimal. \n\nAnother common method of producing first generation therapeutic human antibodies utilizes transgenic animals that produce antibodies from human genes. When challenged with an antigen, these animals produce human antibodies, thus circumventing the laborious humanization steps. 13 Six antibodies from transgenic animal platforms have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 32 more are in clinical trials. 14 This technology, however, is limited to the production of antibodies that the immune system of the mouse will recognize. \n\nHuman antibodies can also be produced from B cells isolated from humans; however, this method involves screening large numbers of candidates to identify individuals with circulating antibodies to an antigen, which can be logistically daunting. 15",

Most therapeutic antibodies in the clinic today are of murine origin largely due to the early availability of the mouse hybridoma technology; however, entirely mouse antibodies have poor pharmacokinetics in humans due to human anti-mouse antibody immune responses (Fig. 1E). To reduce immunogenicity, murine antibodies are commonly modified to murine/human chimeric antibodies or humanized antibodies for therapeutic applications (Carter, 2006;   and Valge-Archer, 2007) ( Fig. 1F-G). Later, transgenic mice and in vitro phage display were employed to generate fully human therapeutic antibodies to circumvent the immunogenicity issue associated with murine sequences (Fig. 1H) (Hoogenboom, 2005;Lonberg, 2005;Jakobovits et al., 2007;Lee et al., 2007). In addition to phage display, antibody fragments can also be displayed on yeast (Feldhaus et al., 2003), bacteria (Harvey et al., 2004), mammalian cells (Smith and Zauderer, 2009) and other in vitro systems such as ribosomes (Hanes et al., 1998). The pros and cons of the various antibody platforms have been broadly reviewed recently ). The ever increasing demand for improved tools for antibody drug discovery will lead to new platforms and technologies. For example, humanized rabbit mAbs are being developed as therapeutics (News, 2010;Yu et al., 2010). Another important source of antibodies is the human antibody B cell repertoire. The isolation of human mAbs has been a labor-intensive endeavor, either through EBV immortalization or hybridoma fusion, or by constructing phagedisplayed antibody libraries (Vaughan et al., 1996;Traggiai et al., 2004;Li et al., 2006b;Rothe et al., 2007). Significant technological breakthroughs in B lymphocyte culture and cloning were reported recently including the analysis of HIV and flu mAbs in naturally infected or vaccinated humans (Wrammert et al., 2008;Jin et al., 2009;Ogunniyi et al., 2009;Schei",

            "text": "In the war against infectious disease, the ability to develop nontoxic and fast-acting therapeutic and prophylactic drugs is just as important as being able to design safe and efficacious vaccines. Besides its usefulness in evaluating the efficacy of vaccine-induced immune responses, phage display can also be used to identify and synthesize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can be used for therapeutic purposes in a variety of infections. An additional benefit of antibody identification through phage display is that because phage libraries can be generated from any set of sequences, it is possible to display human antibody fragments, thus avoiding the side effects inherent in humanized or chimeric antibodies. 183 This approach has produced several mAbs with potential therapeutic applications against agents of infectious disease, including influenza A virus, 184 Clostridium difficile, HIV, viral hepatitis, rabies, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis). 185 Of these, the mAb targeting the protective antigen of B. anthracis, raxibacumab, is so far the only one that has met all criteria for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 186 With the growing emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and the ever-present public health threat of pandemic viral infections, there has been an increasing pressure on the scientific community to discover, test, and produce novel antimicrobial drugs. High-throughput methods for synthesis and screening an increased number of targets resulting from the ''omic'' revolution have significantly advanced the search for new therapeutics. Combinatorial chemistry and diversity-oriented synthesis are 2 of the most important new methodologies in drug discovery because they have drastically reduced the time and costs associated with producing effective, marketable, and competitive new drugs. The power of these techniques comes from the ability to synthesize extremely large libraries of high-quality compounds with complex molecular diversity that increases their likelihood of interacting with biological macromolecules in a selective manner with high affinity. 187 Phage display libraries have also been used widely in screening for novel drug candidates based on specific protein-protein interactions. Although they are frequently cheaper than most chemical synthesis methodologies, there are still several",

            "text": "While the library size can be defined by one number (N) and the effective size can be assessed by the percentage of antibody display, the diversity of a library has a somewhat elusive definition. Sometimes the size of an antibody repertoire is used as a proxy to characterize its diversity. However, it assumes that the antibody repertoire is a random set of antigen-binding site shapes and amino acid sidechains. Furthermore, not all antibody repertoires are created equal. \n\nFor instance, if one were to generate a library of antibody variants by diversifying all the 11 positions of the LCDR1 with the 20 amino acids, the resultant repertoire would be 20 11 or 2 \u00d7 10 14 antibody variants. This would appear to be a diverse repertoire based on its size and it would thus presumably lead to a large number of functional antibodies. Nevertheless, most of the amino acids in LCDR1 are located in the periphery of the antigen-binding site and have a marginal role in defining the binding properties of antibodies, especially for small and mid-sized targets [40]. Therefore, such a library would very likely be of limited use. In contrast, the same library size, e.g., 11 positions mutated to the 20 amino acids, but in the HCDR3, which is located at the center of the antigen-binding site and plays a critical role in recognizing diverse targets, would likely yield antibodies with reasonable affinity [41]. Hence, diversity is not only the number of in-frame and/or non-toxic antibody variants, but it is also the number of functional molecules capable of recognizing as many diverse targets as possible. \n\nThe first functional antibody repertoires used as a substrate to build phage display antibody libraries were obtained from immunized animals [42] or humans [43]. This type of library, known as immune, has been of limited application as general-purpose platforms for human therapeutic antibody discovery. Those obtained from immunized animals are single-use libraries as the libraries are biased toward the recognition of the antigen utilized as an immunogen. More importantly, the antibodies obtained from immune libraries, being nonhuman proteins, require further engineering (humanization), which increases the cost of the antibody drug development process.",

            "text": "We report the selection of human mAbs specific to hYKL-40 using human synthetic Fab phage display libraries. In vitro display technologies, such as phage and yeast display, have been successful for therapeutic applications against a variety of target antigens [36,42,43]. In particular, phage display is a powerful tool that has been proved to be highly effective for the selection of human antibodies through diverse human phage display libraries, mostly in either a na\u00efve format generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or a semi-synthetic format constructed on a selected VH and VL scaffold by randomizing their CDRs [31][32][33][34]. Given the increased therapeutic value of YKL-40, many studies employing antibodies targeting hYKL-40 have been performed and reported that the antibodies are effective to modulate the biological processes that YKL-40 is involved, such as growth, differentiation, and metastasis of cancer cells [23][24][25] but most of the studies were performed with antibodies from mouse hybridoma and thus this is believed to be the first report of human antibodies targeting hYKL-40 identified from a human synthetic antibody phage display library. Moreover, human antibodies had desirable biophysical properties in terms of affinity, thermal stability, and non-aggregation, which are essential for the development of therapeutics. \n\nOver the antibody selection with the phage display libraries employed, the KFab-I library, an in house human synthetic Fab phage display library constructed on a V H 3 and a V k 1 framework by randomizing their CDRs, yielded two anti-hYKL-40 mAb clones (H1 and H2) with high affinity of which H1 was selected dominantly (~73%) and found to be effective to inhibit growth and migration of cancer cells. Although more binders were identified from KFab-II, the other human synthetic Fab phage display library built on a V H 1 and a V k 1 framework, those clones were far below the two binders from KFab-I in their affinity and efficacy. Since the two libraries were built with CDRs designed by the same randomization scheme, we reasoned that the framework could make the difference.",

            "text": "ombinant technologies (49,129). Notably, over the past decades, phage display has been the most widely used system for the production of rAbs and was awarded 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Application of phage antibody libraries has been reported for identification of various targets, including haptens, and foreign and self-antigens (106,130,131). Moreover, the use of phage display for therapeutic purposes has received great attention. The first FDA-approved therapeutic antibody produced based on this technique was adalimumab (Humira), that was approved as an anti-tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) human antibody against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the US in 2002 (86,132). Overall, 15 therapeutic antibodies isolated from phage display libraries have been approved by the US FDA (Table 1), and over 110 antibodies are currently in clinical evaluation stage (http://tabs.craic.com/).\n\nAlthough phage display has many advantages, the main limitation of this method, which is also seen in the ribosome and bacterial display techniques, is that antibody interrogation is based only on the binding properties of binders and not on functional features (147)(148)(149). Moreover, until recently, these technologies were unable to preserve the cognate V H -V L pairing, because obtaining paired information requires determining the antibody sequence at individual cell level (150, 151). This limitation sometimes leads to rising antibodies with inferior selectivity and weaker biophysical features compared with human antibodies or Igs (152), however, this disadvantage can be adjusted in immune libraries due to the pre-enrichment and in vivo affinity maturation (88).\n\nOver the last decade, single-cell technologies combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have been introduced as a high-throughput screening of antibodies, which are highly boosted by microfluidic platforms (153, 154). Surface display platforms combined with single-cell technologies can provide open-source computational tools to interrogate more in-depth V H -V L sequences in display libraries (150, 155) and allow screening of diverse antibodies based on their functional properties, affinity, and biophysical characteristics (151).

            "text": "Finally, the individual clones are analyzed for antigen-binding by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the corresponding genes are sequenced to complete the initial screening of Nbs (9). Among the identified Nbs, selection of the lead compounds is later on performed using functional assays, depending on the desired properties and applications. Since Nbs have no complex structure, they can be expressed in large quantities in hosts such as prokaryotic cells. The entire process of constructing an immune library and screening target antibodies by phage display is shown in Figure 1. \n\nIn addition to immune libraries, natural libraries (12) and synthetic/semi-synthetic libraries (13) have also been proposed for generation of Nbs. These libraries are not dependent on immune responses in experimental animals, but usually, the content of the libraries needs to be much higher than that of immune libraries, especially for natural libraries (~10 9  individual clones) (3). In addition to phage display, the methods for screening the required Nbs from libraries also include cell surface display (14), ribosome display (15), mRNA/cDNA display (16), and high-throughput DNA sequencing and mass spectrometric identification (17), etc. There are also different suitable methods for different constructed libraries (9). \n\nNbs can be used as a good tool for research, diagnosis, and treatment. However, they need to be chemically functionalized to achieve certain functions in specific scenarios. Like for other proteins, chemical functionalization methods for Nbs can include natural amino acid residue methods, labeling methods, and non-natural amino acid methods (18). Using these methods, Nbs can be linked to fluorescent proteins (FP) or other detection moieties for imaging or to therapeutic moieties such as radionuclides, toxins or small molecule drugs as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for targeted therapy. In addition, Nbs can be formatted into a variety of other forms, such as the polyvalent Nb (polymer formed by the same Nbs) or multi-specific Nb (polymer formed by different Nbs). Compared with monovalent Nbs, these can have stronger apparent affinity or avidity for antigen (19, 20).",

The yeast display library contains >2 \u00d7 10 9 unique nanobody clones that mimic a na\u00efve llama immune repertoire in CDR sequence composition and CDR3 length and possesses moderate diversity in the CDR1 and CDR2 regions and extensive diversity in the CDR3 region 7,33 . We identified polyreactive clones that bound to detergent-solubilized Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell membranes (Fig. 1) 21 . This mixed protein polyspecificity reagent (PSR) is compatible with sorting large pools of antigen na\u00efve clones to determine global contributions to polyreactivity in an unbiased manner 26 and is well validated against other measures of polyreactivity for conventional antibodies 2,21,22 . Notably, PSR binding correlates with poor pharmacokinetics, a liability that is often discovered in late-stage clinical development and attributed to high polyreactivity 2 , and is commonly employed to detect polyreactivity 23,[38][39][40][41] . We used Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) to enrich for polyreactive clones and deplete non-expressing clones from the library. Following MACS, distinct populations of clones with high and low polyreactivity were isolated by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). \n\nAs PSR staining is typically used to analyze polyreactivity of conventional antibodies rather than nanobodies, we validated PSR performance on nanobodies.",

            "text": "In the last decades, numerous combinatorial methodologies for the selection and screening of proteins were developed, which mimic natural evolutionary processes in vitro and aim at detecting interaction partners with specific chemical and/or physical properties. Among these, surface display technologies play a central role and besides bacterial, ribosomal, yeast and other screening methods, phage display is by far the most widespread application for screening of protein interaction partners or selecting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications [76]. \n\nWith the latest developments discussed here, the presentation of cDNA and ORF expression products on phage has become not only possible, but led to an increase in library quality, produced indepth analysis of the enrichment process, became faster, more convenient and reasonably priced. Thus the application of this approach and variations thereof will increase constantly in the future. Most application areas described in this review centre around the identification of novel allergens, potential biomarkers in autoimmune disorders [43,77], cancer [78,79] or vaccine development [80]. However, additional fields of application, such as screening for cellular targets of toxic chemical compounds emerge [81]. \n\nThe next level of phage display will indisputably see the implementation of NGS into automation strategies for screening of combinatorial libraries [82]. The application of semi-automated selection strategies, such as developed in our laboratory [83,84] not only allows the reduction of variability and increased reproducibility of the selection protocol, but can be readily implemented in process pipelines based on unit-automation [85,86]. Such pipelines, in turn, can be easily extended to include NGS as a sophisticated analysis tool of the selection outcome. \n\nTwenty-five years after its introduction, phage display persists to be the most popular and successful surface display application with more than 4,000 entries in PubMed. With the latest developments in library design and the combination of phage display with high-throughput selection pipelines and next generation sequencing, the field has become as vibrant as ever.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their derivatives 1 represent a major class of therapeutics and have become the bestselling drugs in United States in recent years. 2,3 The global mAb market size reached ~$150 billion in 2020 and is expected to double in the next five years. 2 To date, approved fully human therapeutic antibodies were discovered from either in vivo animal immunization (including humanized mice and convalescent human donors) or in vitro phage display technology. For in vivo animal immunization, antibodies are generated through repeated immunization of target of interest. Antibodies with high affinity and developability are selected during the development of immune response. However, this process is time intensive and requires the antigen to be immunogenic and nontoxic. In addition, because the selection is entirely completed in vivo, there is limited control over properties, such as specificity and epitope. As the other approach, phage display technology has greatly advanced the therapeutic mAb discovery process by providing a highly versatile approach and overcoming many drawbacks present in in vivo antibody generation technologies. Due to the completely in vitro selection system, phage display surpasses in vivo discovery approaches by enabling the discovery of antibodies against virtually any targets or epitopes, including those that are either toxic or nonimmunogenic for animal immunization. [4][5][6] Moreover, due to fully controlled selection conditions, phage display can be tailored for selection for desired properties that may not be achievable by in vivo approaches, e.g., selection for a specific epitope recognition, 7,8 pH-dependent binding, 9,10 antibody internalization, 11,12 and even catalytic activity. 13 Furthermore, phage display libraries have successfully led to antibody discovery against the most challenging targets or epitopes, e.g., the stem region of influenza hemagglutinin, 14 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 15 and specific conformations of ion channels. [16][17][18] A recently developed new generation of phage libraries with protein quality control steps in the library construction will further close the developability gap between antibodies derived in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, there is an increasing consideration that development of antibody-based affinity reagents and therapeutics should be",

These are relatively easy to produce as synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries. However, the disadvantages of these antibody formats are the unreliable isolation of target-specific clones by phage display, relatively low stability, low solubility and often relatively poor affinities [64,65]. Henry et al. [66] attempted to address these limitations by extensively screening human VH and VL scaffolds to isolate those with high stability, solubility, yield and suitability for carrying CDR mutations. They then selected three of the most suitable scaffolds and carried out targeted trinucleotide mutagenesis of CDRs producing libraries of ~ 10 10 diversity. High affinity ligands (low nM) were isolated but the general limitations of human single domain antibodies were not resolved. These issues may be due to human VH and VL domains usually being paired in nature resulting in the burying of hydrophobic surfaces that are surface exposed in the equivalent single domain structures.",

            "text": "There were a number of possible explanations for this modest difference in potencies, compared with the potentially enormous difference in diversity of the starting pools, one of which is that, as both sets of selections started from a pool of VH and VL CDR3 mutants derived via phage display selections, there may already be a pre-selected bias in the structural diversity, e.g., for bacterial expression and folding in the periplasm. The greater potential diversity of the ribosome displayed VH/VL recombinations may not therefore represent as high a functional diversity as, say, if the initial selections on the individual VH and VL CDR3 libraries had been performed in the ribosome display format. We are currently investigating whether such an approach would lead to further improvements in diversity and final affinity and potency of selected antibodies. Alternatively, there may be a potency ceiling for the biological system, (IL-1 \u03b2 binding to IL-1RI) being investigated here. It is intriguing that the natural antagonist for IL-1RI, IL-1Ra, has a very similar potency in the biological assays, particularly as the lead antibodies generated here appear to be binding in a similar location as the natural antagonist, as demonstrated by competitive binding (Fig. 3), even with a substantially higher affinity for IL-1R1 (Jedi067: monovalent K D = 2.5 pM; Fig. S2), compared with that of the reported antagonist (150 pM). Previous reports of antibodies generated against the IL-1RI, with a similar competitive mechanism of action also exhibited very similar potencies to the IL-1Ra, suggesting a limit to achievable potency when targeting this epitope. \n\nTaken together, these hypotheses may also explain why, physiologically, there are multiple strategies to inhibit the potent activity of IL-1, which include IL-1Ra but also release of soluble receptors (solIL-1RI, solIL-1RII), as well as a non-signaling decoy receptor (IL-1RII). 16,17",

            "text": "Cancer, a complex and multifaceted group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, remains a significant global health challenge. The development of effective cancer treatment drugs is crucial in addressing this pervasive issue [82][83][84]. Among the diverse arsenal of therapeutic approaches, antibodies play a pivotal role due to their precision in targeting specific molecules associated with cancer cells. In the contemporary landscape, phage display stands out as one of the most prevalent and robust systems for the discovery and development of antibodies. Its widespread adoption is attributed to several advantages, such as the manipulable size of the phage's genome, the efficient nature of phage infection, the cost effectiveness and safety associated with phage preparation and propagation, and the ability to perform high-throughput screening for peptides and antibodies. Additionally, the technology allows for rapid screening, contributing to its appeal [85]. Despite these numerous advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge that there are still areas within this technology that demand further enhancement and refinement to meet evolving needs. \n\nAn advantageous aspect of the phage display library, in comparison to other antibody development technologies, lies in its swift and convenient retrieval of peptide sequence information [14]. Typically, the assessment focuses on the most abundant sequences obtained from the panning output. However, a challenge arises when very few specific clones, carrying a small percentage of the sequence information, are acquired. This limitation is a result of the amplification bias of the desirable antibody-displaying phages during the panning cycles, causing certain sequences to become increasingly rare throughout the process. Furthermore, it is essential to acknowledge the potential divergence in conformation between chemically synthesized peptides and their original state on the phage display. The presence of multiple copies of exogenously displayed peptides on the phages can lead to robust binding during the selection process. Therefore, maintaining the authentic conformation of phage-derived peptides during chemical synthesis becomes crucial to ensure that their binding strength remains comparable to the original phages. Additionally, a recurring challenge in this technology is the occurrence of false positives during screening. This issue arises from the non-specific absorption that can preoccupy the phages before positive selection, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate false positives and enhance the accuracy of the screening process [86].",

            "text": "Phage display is the first and still the most widely used technology for in vitro antibody selection. The strategy was developed based on the excellent work of George P. Smith in 1985 [14], who used recombinant DNA techniques to fuse foreign peptides with a coat protein (pIII) of bacteriophage M13 in order to display peptides on the bacteriophage surface. He then created \"antibody-selectable phage vectors\" and described an in vitro method that enabled affinity selection of antigen-specific phagedisplayed antibodies from 10 8 -fold excess phage pools [92]. It was later discovered that scFv, small antibody formats, can be expressed on phage filaments. At the time, there were three different research institutions independently establishing phage-displayed scFv or Fab antibody libraries: the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the UK [13,93,94], the German Cancer Research Center in Germany [95], and Scripps Research Institute in the USA [96]. Since then, these phagedisplayed antibody libraries have proven to be a reliable discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human mAbs [97].\n\nThe process of identifying mAbs from a phagedisplayed library begins with antibody-library construction (Fig. 4a). The variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, representing the Ig gene-encoding repertoire, are ligated into a phage display vector (phagemid). High quality mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The different V H and V L chain-region gene families are then amplified using specific primers to amplify all transcribed variable regions within the Ig repertoire [98,99]. The format of antibodies in a phage-displayed library can be either scFv or Fab fragments (Fig. 4b); scFvs are composed of the V H and V L domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100,101",

            "text": "Antibody phage display is utilized widely for the development of monoclonal antibodies, due in large part to the in vitro nature of the technology, which enables the isolation of human antibodies with exquisite antigen specificities [1]. Many therapeutic antibodies have been discovered or optimized by phage display technology [2], validating its utility as a technological platform for biopharmaceutical drug development. Antibody libraries with high diversity and sophisticated designs have been constructed and shown to produce high-quality antibodies with desired functional activities suitable for therapeutic applications [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. \n\nDespite its apparent technological advantages, however, antibody phage display has not entirely displaced antibody discovery from the immunized animal; on the contrary, animal-derived monoclonal antibodies (including chimeric, humanized, and fully human antibodies) constitute a majority of therapeutic antibodies used currently in clinic or under clinical evaluation [11]. It has been suggested that the eukaryotic quality control machineries may favor antibody clones with better physicochemical properties and expression efficiency [12], critical attributes for the successful development of therapeutic antibodies. Another factor that distinguishes the in vivo antibody generation process from the in vitro phage display approach is the linkage between binding and amplification. B cell activation and proliferation require antigen binding to a functional B cell receptor (BCR) and the subsequent signaling events, and the absence of in-frame BCR or the lack of antigen binding to BCR results in B cell apoptosis [13]. In theory, a similar mechanism is applied to antibody phage display; antigen-binding phage clones are selected and amplified in Escherichia coli host cells, whereas non-binders are washed out and discarded. However, unlike the B cell activation by BCR signaling, the binding and amplification steps of phage display are separated spatially and temporally. As a result, a large number of nonbinding clones are retrieved and amplified, and, because some of them-especially non-producing clones with early stop codons-have a sufficient growth advantage to compensate for the loss in numbers during wash cycles, they may overwhelm the output after multiple rounds of biopanning.",

            "text": "A large number of recombinant antibodies for application in diagnostics and therapy were already generated by phage display against viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins. Antibody phage display allows the generation of antibodies originating from several species, including human, camel, llama, alpaca, chimpanzee, macaque, pig, mice, chicken or shark. These antibodies are derived from two types of library  sources: immune or universal libraries. Immune libraries are preferred when convalescent patients or immunized animals/ human donors are available. This approach offers the advantage to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. Universal antibody gene libraries offer an alternative if immunization is not possible, ethically not feasible or patient samples are not available. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic should teach us to be prepared for the next pandemic, which beyond any doubt will come. We need permanent preparedness platforms which will react on novel pathogens arising worldwide and provide antibodies for diagnostics and as potential therapeutic lead candidates. This preparedness platforms should also have a budget for immediate start of GMP production and clinical phase I/II studies. In the most cases, new pathogens may have only a local impact, but this cannot be assured. Also these antibodies are always valuable tools for research and diagnostics of the pathogens. \n\nWe do not build a fire department when the house is already burning, we need to establish it in advance and maintain this service also in times without emergency. We have to think in the same way about infectious diseases and potential pandemics.",

In an effort to isolate \"fully human\" antibodies and thus bypass humanization, phage display was adapted at the beginning of 1990s (McCafferty et al., 1990) to display antibody V-domain repertoires and to isolate antibodies of interest in vitro. During the 1990s and the last decade, several academic laboratories and biotechnology companies have designed and implemented human antibody phage-displayed libraries for antibody discovery (Hoogenboom, 2005;Bradbury, 2010). Such libraries have enabled the isolation of high affinity and specific antibodies against a wide range of molecules and the antibody library design and implementation process continues to evolve. \n\nSince phage display bypasses immunization, it is especially useful for obtaining antibodies against targets that are highly conserved across species and those that may be toxic, where in vivo methods are ineffective and/or impractical. In addition, since phage display technology allows access to the repertoire of genes intended for expression and display on the phage surface, the number of genes and variants can be designed or chosen to bias the repertoire toward genes with predefined characteristics, opening up the possibility of testing hypotheses on how the size of a repertoire, its diversity and composition impact the selection of specific, stable, soluble, and high affinity antibodies. Overviews of different man-made repertoires and how their performance has enhanced our knowledge of the evolution of the antibody repertoire are provided below.",

Therefore, in this study, we compared the relative ability of a semi-synthetic scFv library and a natural nonimmune Fab library to generate useful diagnostic antibodies that can be converted and expressed as soluble recombinant antibodies to be used as a detection reagent. Our choice of antigens was two commonly cited bioterrorism threats, epsilon toxin (Etox) and protective antigen (PA). While screening of the scFv library produced multiple clones that bound as phage, only a small percentage of clones were successfully expressed as either soluble scFv or full-length IgG and retained specificity and functionality. On the other hand, screening of the Fab library produced multiple high affinity clones against Etox and PA, all of which functioned as soluble Fab. Upon conversion to full-length IgG, they were capable of sub-microgram levels of detection in a sandwich ELISA. Many of the synthetic scFv clones were found to contain amber stops in their CDRs or N-linked glycosylation sites. However, removal of these sequences did not render the majority of these clones amenable to expression as soluble recombinant antibody, suggesting that improper folding may also be a factor. The results of the study suggest that non-immune naturally derived antibody libraries may be preferable to synthetic scFv libraries for rapid isolation of antibodies against typical foreign or pathogenic protein antigens.",

            "text": "Combinatorial protein engineering methodologies such as phage display are powerful tools for high-throughput investigations of protein-protein interactions. Since originally developed [1], phage display has become a work horse around the world both for basic protein chemistry work as well as for academic and pharmaceutical development of biotherapeutic drugs, e.g. the therapeutic antibodies used in autoimmune disease and cancer. \n\nIn the current study by Rom an-Mel endez et al [2], the scope has been to use phage display technology to help define the breadth of anti-citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Within the field of clinical immunology, a positive serological antibody test is often part of the clinical diagnostic criteria, and in many disease settings the precise target(s) of autoantibodies are well understood. However, in RA synthetic peptide(s) (CCP2/3) are used in the clinical assays serving as a proxy for ACPA reactivity. The autoantigens contain the modified amino acid citrulline, which is naturally generated by enzymatic modification by PADs, but the precise autoantibody targets are still debated in RA. \n\nPhage display has proven an effective method for epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies as well as for understanding natural immune responses. The phage systems enable screening of a large number of candidate epitopes with more affinity discrimination than peptide arrays, but comes with the caveats of primarily binding to linear epitopes and not including mammalian specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). While randomized peptide libraries have been successfully used in many studies including recently for mapping SARS-CoV2 antibodies [3], cDNA or synthetic peptidome libraries have the advantage of only containing naturally occurring epitopes making them more applicable for directed human serological studies. Many original phage display platforms have used the M13 bacteriophage, yet the T7 phage-based systems have recently shown to be highly competitive, in particular for fast high-throughput proteomic screenings. This has previously also been demonstrated using the VirScan platform for screening of antibody responses to common viruses [4].",

            "text": "such long loops tend to generate less stable antibodies and thus, the resultant antibodies are less developable than those with short HCDR3 loops. \n\nFinally, one can argue that potent neutralizing antibodies, e.g., IgG-A7, were obtained from the immune library with a lesser effort, i.e., a fewer number of clones were screened and characterized, when compared to ALTHEA Gold Plus Libraries\u2122. Therefore, the immune library seemed to be a more efficient means to discover V regions for diagnostic and/or antibody-based drug development. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that although we characterized the outcome of each step in the stepwise discovery and optimization strategy, VH and VL RAM are amenable to automation without the need of intermediate characterization nor design of new libraries-we used the PLs as source of diversity in the RAM approach, which should speed-up the optimization process of antibodies selected during the discovery phase. In comparison, making immune libraries requires: (1) the identification of a donor with high titers of specific antibodies, (2) the collection of B-cells, (3) the RT-PCR repertoire of V regions, (4) to synthesize the libraries in a scFv or Fab format by PCR or molecular cloning, (5) cloning and electroporation of the libraries, and (6) library rescue and quality control. In our experience, these tasks may take, depending on the laboratory expertise, 4-6 weeks, whereas na\u00efve libraries are \"ready-to-use\" and, hence, bypass all the above steps. \n\nOf note, potent neutralizing anti-SASR-CoV-2 antibodies from na\u00efve libraries with similar or even higher potency than those obtained from immune libraries have recently been reported [6]. The authors performed two rounds of selection from a semisynthetic phage display na\u00efve library first, followed by yeast display sorting. This strategy combined the advantages of large and diverse na\u00efve phage display libraries with a precise subsequent yeast display selection using flow cytometry. Importantly, few developability liabilities were identified in the selected antibodies, emphasizing the value of well-designed na\u00efve libraries to accelerate the discovery, manufacturing and clinical testing of antibodies isolated from this type of libraries.",

            "text": "The identification of new conserved epitopes resulted from analysis with two broadly neutralizing mAbs, specific for the HA2 subunit of influenza virus belonging to different clades. Both mAbs were generated by phage display from B cells of an influenza vaccinated individual [150] and from a \"nonimmune\" human antibody library [151]. Contrary to the disadvantages listed for phage display libraries, these are high affinity mAbs, in the range of nanomolar and picomolar, respectively. \n\nGeneration of mAbs by phage display technology was a breakthrough since this technology opened possibilities to isolate human antibodies for any kind of epitope/antigen without immunization. The success of this technology can be observed by the approval of some drugs, mAbs and other kinds of proteins, and many more are under clinical studies at different stages. There are some candidates for Phase 3 clinical trial, bringing promises of new drugs in the near future [25,134]. As a perspective for infectious diseases, this technology should be more widely applied for rapid screening of antibodies for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes based on immune or na\u00efve human libraries when epidemic infectious disease breaks without an available drug for its treatment. Other perspective concerns the combinatorial library construction. Recently, the human antibody repertoire derived from blood of human na\u00efve or immunized donors has been intensively analyzed by next-generation sequencing [152,153]. Advances in the knowledge of the human antibody repertoire would help in the designing of antibody libraries and for antibody maturation of existing human libraries, making possible the selection of mAbs with higher affinity for clinical use.",

            "text": "For discovery of therapeutic antibodies through phage display technology, antibodies against a target, such as a protein or a cell, are enriched through consecutive selection rounds. This often results in a large phage pool consisting of antibody sequences of both high and low frequency (Yang et al., 2017). Direct screening, where only a sub-fraction of the antibody diversity is subjected to testing, mainly identifies the most abundant antibodies and, when whole cells are used as target, subsequently their corresponding specificities. As the antibody frequency is not related to functionality, there is a need to facilitate discovery also of low-abundant antibodies and thus find additional antibodies and, when applicable, additional specificities. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated four deep mining strategies to facilitate discovery of low abundant clones, using a phage pool previously generated by panning on a complex target, whole cells (Ljungars et al., 2018). From this pool, a diversity of binders with a handful of different specificities had been found through a direct screening approach (Ljungars et al., 2018). Yet the present study demonstrated that there were additional antibodies of different specificities to be found, at low frequency, as such antibodies could be enriched following selection on recombinant antigen. Additional deep mining strategies were used to identify rare clones that bind, for this phage pool, previously undiscovered targets and epitopes. These strategies can be used to unlock the full potential of phage pools generated through panning on cells. \n\nTo reduce the frequency of already discovered antibodies and specificities, we applied an antibody blocking strategy where the previously generated phage pool underwent panning on whole cells in the presence of 241 previously discovered antibodies specific for six different receptors. Antibodies against new epitopes on the target cells were successfully enriched and subsequently discovered. This is in agreement with previous studies where antibodies against new epitopes on a single target protein (Ditzel et al., 1995;Ditzel, 2002;Tsui et al., 2002), a cell lysate (Sanna et al., 1995), or whole cells (Even-Desrumeaux et al., 2014) have been found through a blocking strategy.",

            "text": "for antibody discovery, in 1990, antibody phage display technology was developed as an application of the filamentous fusion phage (74). In this case, the genetic sequences of the immunoglobulin variable domains (single-chain variable fragments, scFvs) were fused with the DNA sequence of the phage gene III, allowing the variable domains to be expressed on the surface of fd bacteriophages, thereby conveniently linking genotype with phenotype through the phage. When an antigen of interest is available, antibody phage display technology enables the selection and isolation of high affinity scFv binders (74). Since its development and until now, the construction of large na\u00efve, immune, synthetic, and semi-synthetic libraries as a source of antibodies, of animal or human origin, has positioned antibody phage display technology as an extremely powerful tool for high-throughput antibody discovery (75). To date, more than 10 monoclonal antibodies derived from phage display experiments have successfully entered the market for a diverse range of therapeutic indications. Of these, it is worth highlighting the first approved fully human antibody (adalimumab), which is an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases and remains the top selling pharmaceutical of the global market (76).\n\nIn 1993, Hamers-Casterman et al. reported the discovery of heavy-chain only antibodies (HCAbs), which are naturally present in camelids (i.e., camels, llamas, dromedaries, and alpacas) (77). Later on, further research confirmed that the variable domain of these antibodies (V H H) alone, with a size of about 12-15 kDa, is still functional, turning it into the smallest antibody fragment with antigen binding capacity (78). Notably, these single-domain antibodies (also known as nanobodies) possess important structural differences in the antigen binding region compared to conventional antibodies, which may provide them with an ability to recognize cryptic (hidden) epitopes (79). Due to their specific antigen binding capacity, together with their high solubility, stability, and ability to penetrate rapidly into deep tissue, among other favorable characteristics (78), several therapeutic candidates based on single-",

The first step for display technologies is to select a library of heavy and light chain genes that can be cloned into the system of interest. The library is either derived from immunized, infected, or otherwise immune-challenged individuals; or from universal donors that have not undergone specific immune activation. While the former libraries are more focused and potentially affinity-matured, na\u00efve libraries have to potential to select antibodies against virtually any antigen. After cloning the library into the desired expression system, combinations of heavy and light chains, often in the scFv or Fab format, are displayed on the particle surface and selected by their ability to bind the antigen of interest. Non-binders are removed via wash steps to leave the best antibody candidates, which can be further refined through additional panning steps using the same or different binding conditions. Since the genes of interest are immediately available, the soluble protein can be expressed and used to quantify antibodyantigen affinity via methods such as ELISA. While hybridoma-derived antibodies still dominate the pool of therapeutics, six display-derived antibodies have been approved, and new in vitro methods for antibody selection continue to be discovered. 129 The first display technology developed, and still the most widely used, uses bacteriophage for surface expression of antibody variable domains and selection of antigen binders. 130 Phage display, which uses viruses such as M13 phage, works by fusing the antibody scFv sequence with that of phage surface molecules like coat protein pIII. 131 The DNA sequence within the plasmid codes for the corresponding surface protein, allowing for phenotypic selection and subsequent genotypic identification. Phage particles that bind antigen strongly are amplified via infection of bacterial hosts such as E. coli. This selective expansion of tightly binding phage particles allows for further rounds of panning or DNA sequencing of the associated scFvs. Several antibodies in clinical use were derived from phage display technology, with the first being adalimumab in 2002. 129 Mammalian-",

            "text": "Phage display libraries based on M13 filamentous bacteriophage can present a vast diversity of antibody fragments on the pIII minor coat protein, utilising either a phagemid or phage vector system to encode the antibody-coat protein fusion (the different display systems including mutated helper phage are reviewed elsewhere, [1][2][3]). The presence of the antibody on the surface of the phage particle is accompanied by the gene for the antibody being packaged within the phage. In this way the phenotype (antibody binding) and the genotype (antibody gene) are linked [2]. Within standard panning methods, the highly diverse antibody library is introduced to an immobilised antigen and unbound phage washed away, bound phage are then eluted, usually by a shift in pH and the resulting sub-library propagated in Escherichia coli to amplify each phage clone. Such panning cycles are usually carried out 3-5 times to enrich for phage-antibodies that bind to the target antigen and hundreds of single phage clones are then isolated, propagated and tested in ELI-SAs [2]. More recently, screening has used next generation sequencing platforms to sequence thousands to millions of antibody genes contained within the selected sub-libraries of phage after panning. Sequencing usually targets the whole VH or the CDRH3 domain. These methods allow a thorough investigation of the enrichment of phage clones, even when they are minor components of the sub-libraries [4][5][6]. Phage display libraries can enable the identification of a variety of antibodies with desirable binding properties including antibodies that bind to toxic or non-immunogenic antigens. \n\nNaturally occurring or designed antibody domains have been developed that are suited for phage display but still retain the binding properties of a full-length IgG (Fig. 1). These domains include antigen binding fragments (Fab), single chain Fv (scFv) and single domain antibodies (nanobodies). The latter include camelid V H H and shark V NAR (New Antigen Receptor). \n\nPhage antibody libraries are classed as na\u00efve, semisynthetic, synthetic or immune libraries [2].",

In summary, we have demonstrated that na\u00efve general-purpose synthetic VH repertoires produce similar results than those obtained from an immune VH repertoire. Since Finally, one can argue that potent neutralizing antibodies, e.g., IgG-A7, were obtained from the immune library with a lesser effort, i.e., a fewer number of clones were screened and characterized, when compared to ALTHEA Gold Plus Libraries\u2122. Therefore, the immune library seemed to be a more efficient means to discover V regions for diagnostic and/or antibody-based drug development. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that although we characterized the outcome of each step in the stepwise discovery and optimization strategy, VH and VL RAM are amenable to automation without the need of intermediate characterization nor design of new libraries-we used the PLs as source of diversity in the RAM approach, which should speed-up the optimization process of antibodies selected during the discovery phase. In comparison, making immune libraries requires: (1) the identification of a donor with high titers of specific antibodies, (2) the collection of B-cells, (3) the RT-PCR repertoire of V regions, (4) to synthesize the libraries in a scFv or Fab format by PCR or molecular cloning, (5) cloning and electroporation of the libraries, and (6) library rescue and quality control. In our experience, these tasks may take, depending on the laboratory expertise, 4-6 weeks, whereas na\u00efve libraries are \"ready-to-use\" and, hence, bypass all the above steps. \n\nOf note, potent neutralizing anti-SASR-CoV-2 antibodies from na\u00efve libraries with similar or even higher potency than those obtained from immune libraries have recently been reported [6]. The authors performed two rounds of selection from a semisynthetic phage display na\u00efve library first, followed by yeast display sorting.

            "text": "In addition to these in vitro techniques, phage library approaches with in vivo binding modalities have also been explored. First described for organ targeting using peptide phage libraries where the library was injected intravenously into mice and the phage were subsequently rescued from the brain and kidneys (64), the technique has also been successfully carried out in tumour-bearing mice (65). In recent years, similar methodologies have also been employed with antibody phage libraries not only to identify potentially therapeutic antibodies but also for determining the accessibility of a given target (66), further expanding the boundaries of phage display technology. \n\nToday, almost all widely accessible commercial libraries are based on non-immune repertoires of high complexity to enable use in the selection of antibodies against a virtually unlimited number of target antigens. The latest state-of-art libraries reach complexities of up to 10 11 -10 12 clones and thus may even exceed the size of individual human cell repertoires (67,68). While high-affinity antibodies can be isolated from these libraries, occasionally the affinity of the obtained antibodies is low as the genes are obtained from naive B cells that have not yet undergone affinity maturation. In such cases, where the affinity required for therapeutic efficacy is higher than that of the antibody obtained, in vitro affinity maturation may be performed. This is often accomplished by introducing random or specific mutations in the CDRs or the exchange of whole heavy or light chain domains by chain shuffling (69)(70)(71)(72)(73). Recently, Li et al. described an alternative phage display approach for affinity maturation of a natural human antibody MSL-109 targeting human cytomegalovirus (CMV), where each of the CDRs was allowed to vary in only one amino acid residue at a time (69). Higher affinity antibodies were isolated which had improved CMV neutralization potency when expressed as Fab fragments in bacterial cells. \n\nIn another novel application of in vitro phage library screening, single antibodies capable of dual epitope recognition have also been developed.",

            "text": "Mammalian, phage, yeast, and ribosomal display have contributed to a progressively matured therapeutic antibody pipeline. In the continuous effort to shorten timelines and enhance the efficacy of antibody drug discovery from initial discovery to IND application, mammalian display technology presents unique opportunities. Historically, the antibody selection process has focused on affinity, but there is an increasing need to evaluate multiple properties simultaneously and prioritise developability earlier in the drug discovery process. Mammalian display allows the selection of more complex molecules in their final therapeutic format, representing an essential shift for creating stable, high-concentration formulations. Mammalian display facilitates the selection of repertoires with desirable developability properties at the library scale, supporting the development of complex antibody drugs and bi-and multi-specific biologics. Moreover, the mammalian display may have the potential to reduce timelines from discovery to IND application by selecting single stable integration antibody molecules for both discovery and highproduction CHO clones. This integrated approach would address current hurdles in stable CHO cell line development and regulatory concerns about genetically defined and stable production cell lines. \n\nDespite advancements in mammalian display technology, challenges remain in achieving efficient single-copy gene integration, a critical step for linking genotype to phenotype. Current approaches exhibit limitations in the high-efficiency integration of large transgenes expressing biologics such as antibodies, but future developments in genome engineering technologies may enhance this process, potentially enabling the creation of larger and more diverse libraries. Additionally, mammalian display can be combined with other technologies, such as phage display, to address the limitations of library size. Indeed, the critical need in biotherapeutic discovery is not merely generating diverse populations of binders, which can be achieved using various approaches, but efficiently identifying the best candidates for clinical development from these libraries. Mammalian display partly addresses the challenge of finding functional binders early. Mammalian display-to-secretion switching capabilities can further enhance early discovery efforts by supporting screening in the final format for desired functionality. Recent advances in high-throughput microfluidics-based single-cell screening systems have created opportunities to include biologically relevant assays in the functionfirst screening of mammalian secretion libraries.",

            "text": "Moreover, with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis services, it is possible to identify, construct, produce, and characterize a higher number of novel antigen-binding candidates more rapidly than would be achievable using a traditional phage-display screening protocol. Our results suggest that those antibodies identified by screening are not necessarily those present in the greatest number in the B cell mRNA, in the cDNA library, or in the organism itself. In this instance our library was of high diversity with only a small minority of high copy number duplications. If those sequences represent B cell lines most amplified by the immune response then it may well be that phage-display screening often fails to identify the most immunologically active antibodies. \n\nOne nagging question that remains, and is common to all techniques involving NGS, is whether the antibodies discovered occur in the animal, or are they artifacts due to PCR or sequencing errors. It is well understood that in mass sequencing of highly diverse genes it will be impossible to distinguish fact from artifact [14]. This can be of great concern for those studying the underlying immune response of animals. In our case, however, the problem is less pressing. When the focus is on the acquisition of functional antibodies for biotechnical application the importance is on affinity and stability, rather than on the reproduction of a native antibody. In any case, the recent development of a new technique for bar-coding of cDNA sequences may be useful in the future for control and analysis of sequencing and PCR artifacts [13]. \n\nThe use of NGS may be of use in cases where despite the researchers' best efforts an antibody library fails to meet expectations. Screening for some targets is problematical, some antibodies recovered have regrettably low affinity, and sometimes discovery of novel antibodies is frustrated when a promising phage-display fusion fails to yield equally high affinity when produced as a free antibody. In these and other cases it will be useful to conduct NGS in order to examine the plurality of related antibodies.",

            "text": "Two of the most advanced drugs developed by screening phage-displayed libraries of random peptides are the PEGylated erythropoietin receptor agonist peginesatide (Hematide, Affymax) and the Fc-fused thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim (Nplate, Amgen). Two other drugs, adalimumab, an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody [142], and ecallantide, a small-protein inhibitor of the plasma protease kallikrein [143], have been developed using phage display, putting this technology side-byside with other well-established approaches in the field of drug discovery. \n\nRecent exciting advances in the technique predict a bright future for phage display therapeutics. For example, Tian et al. [144] and Sandman et al. [145] have incorporated genetically-encoded non-natural amino acids into phage-displayed peptides, thereby paving the way for combinatorial libraries of even wider chemical diversities (potentially applicable to the construction of second generation affinity maturation libraries). Furthermore, Woiwode et al. [146] designed a hybrid system of phage display and synthetic chemistry by chemically coupling synthetic compounds to the bacteriophage capsid on a one-compound-one-clone principle (each compound was encoded by a unique nucleotide sequence inserted in a non-coding region of the phage genome). Screening a library of folic acid analogues against KB carcinoma cells over-expressing folate receptors resulted in the identification of several folic acid mimetics. Additional approaches are being developed to better control screening conditions [147,148]. Highly sensitive biosensors, such as Biacore (based on surface plasmon resonance) and quartz crystal microbalance apparatuses (based on the piezoelectric effect), not only enable screening against minute amounts of target but, more importantly, also allow the monitoring of phage-target interactions in real time. This makes it possible to empirically modify the stringency of the washing and elution steps during a single experiment and recover truly high affinity binders.",

            "text": "Therefore, we believe that the antibody phage display library generated in this study may be widely used as a novel rapid screening platform to select target-specific phage display-derived mAbs for use in multiple applications.\n\nThe na\u00efve human antibody libraries have been constructed using human B cells of non-immunized or healthy donors [48].The antibodies isolated from na\u00efve human antibody libraries may often exhibit lower affinities because the antibody repertoire does not undergo in vivo affinity maturation to produce higher-affinity antibodies [48,49].In the present study, we assert that the library we have developed is a high-quality human antibody library with large and diverse repertoires.Several lines of evidence support our notion.Firstly, antibody genes of each variable domain (VH or V\u03ba) were isolated from in vitro immunization of hPBMCs, particularly after stimulation by a combination of R848 and rhIL-2, and we found that AID, a marker protein used to initiate SHM, is highly upregulated.Thus, this suggests that the antibody gene repertoire in the library may be more diverse compared with the existing human na\u00efve antibody library.Second, we constructed a large-sized combinatorial scFv library with 1.5 \u00d7 10 11 antibody clones.Third, the library is comprised of approximately 94% and 91% of the unique antibody sequences in the VH and V\u03ba genes, respectively.Fourth, through two-dimensional heat maps illustrating VJ gene combinations in both VH and V\u03ba, we also confirmed that all the antibody genes in the library are almost evenly distributed.Fifth, comprehensive sequence analysis of the HCDRs and LCDRs showed that the library has more diverse amino acid composition in the CDRs than germline gene segments.Sixth, we found that the individual diversity at each position of the HCDRs and LCDRs in constructed library are approximately 4.3 times or 6.4 times higher than that in natural antibody sequences on average, respectively.Seventh, we observed that frequent SHMs occur in almost all amino acid positions of the library HCDRs and LCDRs and that some of them have a frequency of SHM over 25%.Further, the overall frequency of SHMs in HCDRs was relatively higher than that in LCDRs.",

            "text": "If antibodies selected by in vitro methods are so powerful, why are they not more widely perceived as valuable research reagents? Part of the answer lies in the difficult patent situation, which resulted in restriction of this technology to the high margin therapeutic markets for commercial use. It is perhaps significant in this regard that hybridoma technology was never patented, and achieved relatively wide acceptance within a short period. The situation for some of the core phage display patents is in the process of rapid change as most platform patents have either expired, or will do so over the next few years 175 , and it is possible that the technology will become more widely disseminated as a result. \n\nLargely unnoticed by the research community, some commercial \"monoclonal antibodies\" are actually recombinant antibodies selected by phage display, reformatted to look like traditional murine antibodies by the fusion of Fc regions to human variable regions (e.g. the sulfotyrosine antibody described above 38 ). ABDSerotec also sells a number of unmodified recombinant Fab fragments selected by phage display. It therefore seems that the most important impediments to widespread adoption are a lack of knowledge of the capabilities of this technology, coupled with limited expertise and library availability. Furthermore, the number of companies willing to carry out in vitro selection as a fee for service is vanishingly small compared to the 180 companies willing to generate antibodies by immunization 16 . \n\nHowever, one commonly cited issue relates to the ability to express these antibodies. While the specificities obtained, and described herein, are remarkable, the expression and stability of antibody fragments varies enormously, from exceptionally stable scFv fragments used in clinical trials 176 to other fragments that are poorly expressed. A typical selection almost always generates a number of different binders to any well-folded antigen. Among these there is usually at least one that is sufficiently stable and well produced for research use. Furthermore, it is expected that stability and expression levels will improve as libraries are based on more stable scaffolds 177 . The studies described above indicate that this goal can now be met in highly parallelized screening setups with low effort per antigen 69 , 70 , provided that libraries of sufficient diversity and optimized protocols are used.",

            "text": "The large number of phage display-derived antibodies in clinical development demonstrates the value of this in vitro selection technology for the discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Phage display has not only proven to be a versatile and reliable platform technology for the discovery of \"fully\" human antibodies for over 2 decades, but it has been successfully used for the development of other types of peptide and protein therapeutics, such as ecallantide (Kalbitor \u00d2 , Dyax/Shire), 122 Xyntha purification peptide 204 and the peptibody trebananib (AMG-386, Amgen) 205 (for review see Nixon et al. 86 ).\n\nThe changing intellectual property landscape will further affect development. For many years access to antibody phage display was controlled by a few companies, based on their technology patents. But these, namely the Breitling/D\u20ac ubel (EP0440147) and McCafferty/Winter (EP0774511, EP0589877) families, expired in 2011 in Europe. In the US the patent US5969108 (filed 1990, granted 1991, published 1999), US6172197 (filed 1991, granted 1995, published 2001) and US6806079 (filed 1990, granted 2000, published 2004) are most relevant. The expiration of US patents is more complex and depends on variables such as the filling date, the grant date, patent term adjustments and extensions. Together with lower pricing driven by the competition with biosimilar products, the patent expiry should spur innovation and allow more companies to advance human antibodies made by phage display into the clinic.\n\nAntibody phage display has advantages over newer technologies like yeast or mammalian cell display, including library size (>10 10 ), robust and well-established E. coli expression system, scalability, short panning cycles and cost-efficiency, but also in vitro selection conditions and the ability to pan on antigen-expressing cells. Issues with E. coli expression and phage display of full size IgGs can be addressed with efficient expression platforms and screening technologies. 206 The power of phage display lies in the choice of the optimal in vitro selection conditions, which allows pre-definition of many biophysical and biochemical antibody properties at a very early step of the discovery process",

            "text": "Originally mAbs were isolated using hybridoma technology, and required the fusion of mouse lymphocyte and myeloma cells to generate specific murine antibodies that were often highly immunogenic if used in a therapeutic setting. A limited number of human mAbs were also developed by using human B lymphocytes from naturally infected patients but this proved a technically challenging and generally unreliable approach [48]. Subsequent advances in antibody engineering removed or resolved many of these technology \"road-blocks\" facilitating the generation of chimeric, humanised or deimmunised mAbs and bispecific antibodies with increased potency and reduced immunogenicity. One of the major breakthroughs was the invention of phage display which revolutionised the field of antibody engineering with its robust, easy to use and highly versatile combinatorial display platform. Its successful applications include: generation of antibodies with unique functions from immune and non-immune sources, de novo isolation of high affinity binders from non-immune or synthetic sources and the in vitro affinity maturation of antibodies [43]. Phage based selection could be summarised as the display of antibodies (proteins or peptides) on the surface of bacteriophage by fusing the antibody gene to one of the phage coat proteins and selection based on the antigen binding of individual clones. Phage antibody libraries are constructed by PCR based cloning of VH and VL repertoires by random pairing into a phage or phagemid vector system and display on the surface of bacteriophage. It has been used widely in the antibody engineering as a technique to mimic B cells, which are self-replicating packaged systems containing antibody genes that encode the antibody displayed on its surface (linked genotype and phenotype) [108].",

            "text": "Nanobodies have an extended complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loop that interacts with framework 2 (FRW2) to maintain structural stability (Muyldermans, 2013). Within the FRW2, there are four hydrophilic hallmarks (F37, E44, R45, and G47) (the international ImMunoGeneTics information system, IMGT (Dondelinger et al., 2018) that are pivotal for soluble and monomeric expression. Nanobodies, with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa, are characterized by high solubility and stability, strong permeability, low immunogenicity, and easy tailoring (Yu et al., 2023). These properties have led to their extensive applications, including fundamental biological research, diagnostics, and therapeutics (Jin et al., 2023). For example, they are applied for improving crystallographic stability and resolution as chaperone proteins (Condeminas and Macias, 2024), for facilitating the detection of microorganisms (Salvador et al., 2019), or for tumor treatment as targeting drugs (Kunz et al., 2023). Although they possess many desirable properties, the non-humanized nanobodies may increase the risk of inducing undesirable immune responses when utilized in clinical use, such as anti-drug antibody (ADA) (Rossotti et al., 2022). Therefore, humanization represents a critical step in alleviating immunogenicity and advancing the application of nanobodies. \n\nPhage display has been widely applied in antibody screening due to its easy amplification and affordability (Bozovi\u010dar and Bratkovi\u010d, 2019), leading to the discovery of numerous therapeutic antibodies for clinical development (Frenzel et al., 2016). By creating a synthetic nanobody library and displaying these nanobodies on the phage coat protein p\u0428 or p\u2167 (Jaroszewicz et al., 2022), antigen-specific nanobodies can be rapidly identified with the assistance of in vitro screening.",

Phage display technology is a very important research method in the field of drug discovery. At present, the FDA has approved many peptide and antibody drugs derived from this technology for the treatment of different diseases, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary angioedema, uveitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. \n\nPhage display technology was first used in 1985 to express cloned antigens on a viral surface [239]. A foreign protein, such as an antibody, retains its ability to fold properly and bind to antigens while fusing to the pIII coat protein gene of phage and displaying on its surface [240]. This technology has contributed greatly to the development of therapeutic antibodies used in clinics and was the first technique developed for antibody display screening. Professors George P. Smith and Gregory P. Winter won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their pioneering work on \"phage display of peptides and antibodies\" technology in 2018 [241]. Gradually, it has been demonstrated successfully over time to identify potent, fully human mAbs using these phage-displayed antibody libraries [242]. \n\nCurrently, the commonly used display formats mainly involve antibody fragment phage display libraries, including the Fab library [243,244], scFv library [245,246], and VHH library [247], etc. It is possible to convert intact IgG antibodies from antibody Fab fragments displayed on phage coat proteins with a very small loss of binding activity [248,249]. High-affinity binders can be retrieved more efficiently from camelid immune VHH libraries. Unlike humans, camelids have only heavy chain antibodies in their blood, which lack the light chain. According to the gene source from which the antibody or antibody fragment is obtained, it can be classified into a natural library [240], an immune library [11], or a synthetic library [250,251]. \n\nReverse transcription of PBMCs' mRNA into cDNA produces high-quality cDNA to obtain VH and VL gene sequences.",

            "text": "In antibody phage display, sequences encoding either Fab or scFv are genetically linked to a phage coat protein resulting in display of the fusion protein on the surface of the phage, ensuring a physical genotype-phenotype coupling. A display library may contain more than 10 10 unique binders [92]. There are three main types of antibody libraries: immune, na\u00efve and synthetic [93]. These libraries can be selected on antigen in a process termed biopanning to retrieve specific binders. By performing multiple rounds of selection, modulating both positive and negative selection steps as well as the stringency (e.g., washing, antigen competition, elution), it is possible to direct the clonal output in the desired direction regarding the fine-specificity and other properties of the selected mAbs [94][95][96]. \n\nPhage display has contributed greatly to the field of monoclonal antibody generation and has reduced the cost and time needed compared to hybridoma technology [97,98]. In addition, antibody phage display libraries offer a rich source of fully human antibodies alleviating cross-species issues important for, e.g., therapeutic use [99]. A major step forward with regard to TCR-like mAb generation was made when Andersen et al. combined immunization and display technology [38]. By immunizing mice with target pMHC followed by generation of Fab phage libraries, antibodies against both MHCI and MHCII were successfully isolated [38,87]. \n\nIn 2000, the first TCR-like mAb isolated directly from a na\u00efve human phage library was reported, which recognized HLA-A1 with a peptide from the tumor-derived antigen MAGE-A1 [40]. Despite utilizing a large library (3.7 \u00d7 10 10 independent clones), the candidate antibody was of low affinity, and subsequent affinity maturation allowed for more efficient pMHC detection and target cell killing in vitro [40,42,100]. Since then, many TCR-like mAbs have been isolated (Tables 1 and 2). \n\nAlmost all TCR-like mAbs generated by phage display have been isolated from either immune libraries or from libraries constructed from endogenous antibody repertories.",

            "text": "Display technologies is a term that encompasses multiple techniques, such as phage-, ribosome-, and yeast display. They are recombinant screening techniques that afford the screening of large libraries of peptides and proteins to identify binding motifs for a specific target. Examples of such targets can span the length and complexity scales from small molecules to whole cell or tissue surfaces. The phage display approach involves the ectopic expression of peptides or protein fragment libraries on the coat proteins of bacteriophage virions (1,2). Peptide phage display typically involves 2-5 rounds of affinity selection against a given target in a process called \"library panning\". After elution of binding clones from the target they undergo clonal amplification in a suitable bacterial host, before conducting phage DNA extraction and sequencing of the coat protein gene region that includes the randomised recombinant fragment. From this, the peptide sequences that mediate target engagement are deduced. Discovery of binding peptides can provide lead candidates for drug development as exemplified by the approved kallikrein inhibitor drug, ecallantide , which was FDA approved in 2009 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. In oncology both antibody and peptide phage display has been utilised to discover potential new treatments highlighting the diversity of applications display technologies presents. \n\nSince its invention in the 1980s, peptide phage display technology has developed significantly in terms of both the number of randomised peptides (i.e. library complexity) as well as through increased chemical diversity. Changes in the chemical diversity of randomised native peptides has been achieved in several ways. These include the sitespecific attachment of other chemical species such as reactive glycans to the N-terminus . \n\nComplex cyclic peptide topologies including bi-and tri-cyclic motifs have been achieved either through the chemical reactivity of cysteine with, for example, tris(bromomethyl) benzene to form bicyclic libraries , or directed folding through the inclusion of peptide sequences (e.g. CPPC) that promote the formation of a cystine-knot topology (3). These increases in library complexity and the increased pressure for high-throughput screens against drug targets has demanded faster and more accurate DNA sequencing to ensure the correct candidate sequences are pursued.",

Theoretically, the synthetic ribosome display libraries can be extremely diverse, allowing for the production of extensive pools of nanobodies.

The positive phage clones against CD147-specific VHH were enriched efficiently after three rounds of panning. Compared with the first screening round, 120-fold (Output in Round 3/Round 1 = 60/0.5) greater specific Nb enrichment was observed after the third round (Figure 2A). To obtain CD147specific VHH with good diversity and high affinity, 70 randomly selected colonies were examined by phage ELISA. Among them, 29 clones were positive (Figure 2B) (positivity was defined as a positive/negative ratio > 3). The 29 positive clones were sequenced and analyzed using the DNAMAN sequence alignment software (Figure S2).

            "text": "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and",

Antibodies can be displayed in the form of either single chain variable fragments (ScFv) or antigen-binding fragments (Fab). Recent reports show that single domain antibody can also be displayed in phage display system (Duarte et al., 2016;Kazemi-Lomedasht et al., 2016;Li et al., 2016;Rotman et al., 2015;Tang et al., 2013). Many antibodies against different viruses including rabies virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Ebola virus, yellow fever virus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, hepatitis A virus, influenza virus, and HIV, have been successfully isolated using this technology. The principle for phage display technique in isolating antibodies is to construct a phage display recombinant antibody library first. \n\nRecombinant antibody library can increase the diversity of antibodies in B cell repertoires, which promotes the screening of antibodies with novel properties (Graus et al., 1998). Antibody libraries are in general constructed by randomly assembling antibody heavy and light chain variable region, and through gene shuffling of the heavy and light chain to further increase the diversity. In summary, phage display creates greater diversity of antibodies and provides rapid and high throughput way of screening. \n\nM43 and m44 are HIV-1 cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies isolated from a recombinant phage display library by competitive antigen panning (Zhang et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2004a;Zhang et al., 2004b).

            "text": "Semi-synthetic libraries, which were the first to be made, typically consist of FRs sourced from naturally occurring antibodies and CDR regions synthesized from degenerate oligonucleotides (23,24). In many instances, to simplify construction, only the CDR3 region was fully synthetic. Subsequently, libraries with fully synthetic variable sequences were introduced, with the FR based on consensus sequences from natural antibodies but optimized for high expression on phage in Escherichia coli to reduce the effect of variable expression of the human framework sequences on selection. The first fully synthetic Human Combinatorial Antibody Libraries (HuCAL) generated to produce therapeutic antibodies was reported by Morphosys in 2000 with their first version of the HuCAL (16). Several versions of the HuCAL has since been constructed that incorporate additional features such as improved phage elution by disulphide bond cleavage, selection for in-frame clones, additional CDR3 loop length and diversity and optimization for expression in mammalian cell culture through removal of unwanted potential post-translational modification sites (25,26). These modifications have resulted in an increase in the number of antibodies isolated per target antigen. There are several antibodies generated from the Morphosys libraries currently in various stages of clinical development; a recent example being the potent anti-cancer activity of OMP-18R5, with activity in multiple preclinical human tumour models (27). This antibody targeting the Wnt pathway was isolated from the HuCAL GOLD library and is currently in Phase 1 clinical testing. \n\nWhile synthetic libraries have allowed the development of human antibodies with reduced immunogenicity relative to humanized animal antibodies against self-antigens, the CDRs of these libraries can also be immunogenic as often the sequences are not naturally present in the human antibody repertoire (28). With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.",

            "text": "Several other technologies have been developed to identify TAAs and to use the products as carriers in targeted drug delivery (see Table 3). Arguably the most developed of these is the use of synthetic biology, often based on the bacteriophage display library platform developed by Winter [103]. Newer derivatives of the original platform include the use of different phage strains, bacterial or yeast cells, antibody cDNA, mRNA or random peptide based libraries and various candidate selection protocols. For further details on these systems the reader is referred to recent excellent reviews [2,[104][105][106][107][108]. Historically, as phage display systems developed in parallel with technologies for antibody engineering, it is perhaps not surprising that many of the early display platforms focused on combinatorial antibody heavy and light chain variable region gene libraries. The selection of these gene sequence combinations also allowed their direct grafting onto human constant region gene scaffolds, thus expanding the repertoire of full length humanized antibodies [2]. The first FDA approved antibody developed in this way was Adalumumab, an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody registered in 2008 for use in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. Over 20 phage display derived full length TMAs are currently undergoing clinical assessment, mostly for cancer therapy, several of them for hematological cancers. In addition to expanding the binding diversity of full length antibodies, the single-chain \"minibodies\" generated by these biological systems can be easily linked to drugs as described below. Alongside synthetic biology methods, synthetic chemical techniques also have proven advantageous. A variety of approaches are now available for the generation of combinatorial small molecule, peptide or aptamer libraries for the generation of cancer cell targeting drug carriers [109][110][111][112][113]. Of these strategies, the most developed is that of peptide-drug conjugates and these are discussed further.",

            "text": "The development of nanobodies has traditionally relied on animal immunization techniques, primarily using camelids, to generate high-affinity antibodies [23,24,33]. While effective, these conventional methods present significant logistical and ethical challenges, including the need for extensive animal use and associated costs. Recognizing these limitations, the scientific community has increasingly turned to synthetic antibody libraries as a more sustainable and scalable solution [34]. In particular, phage display technology has emerged as a cornerstone of this shift, enabling high-throughput screening of antibody variants with desired affinities and specificities [24,27,27]. \n\nOur research contributes to this evolving landscape by utilizing TRIM technology to construct a comprehensive synthetic phage-displayed nanobody library. This approach represents a significant advancement over previous methods that predominantly used degenerate codons for CDR diversification. While effective in introducing variability, these traditional techniques often fail to accurately control amino acid composition, leading to the inclusion of stop codons and the potential for frameshift mutations [21,22,[35][36][37]. Our implementation of TRIM technology circumvents these issues and allows for the precise synthesis of CDRs that closely mimic the diversity observed in natural antibodies. This precision engineering facilitated the creation of sublibraries tailored to specific CDR3 lengths, thereby increasing the functional diversity of our library and aligning it with natural antibody variability. \n\nThe isolation of specific nanobodies targeting PD-1 [38], ATXN1 [39], and STAT3 [40] further underscores the practical utility of our synthetic library. These targets, which are associated with critical pathological processes in cancer, neurodegeneration and immune regulation, represent key areas where nanobodies can offer therapeutic and diagnostic advances. Our approach not only facilitates the rapid screening and identification of highaffinity nanobodies, but also provides a more accessible platform for exploring a broader range of disease-related antigens. This flexibility and accessibility distinguish our library from camelidderived or humanized antibodies, which may be limited by the specificities and affinities of the initial immunization repertoire. \n\nIn addition, the expression and characterization of anti-ATXN1 and anti-STAT3 nanobodies using optimized phage display vec-",

            "text": "Other strategies that overcome the disadvantages of hybridoma, e.g. being time-consuming and inefficient to generate antibodies toward toxic antigens, are techniques developed based on in vitro antibody generation. These techniques, known as surface display technologies, were invented concomitant to the application of humanized antibodies. The generation of antibodies by display technologies (e.g. mammalian cell display, ribosome display, yeast display, and phage display) is based on the interaction of displayed antibody fragments with an antigen in vitro. For this approach diverse antibody gene libraries are used (48,80). Typically, the recombinant antibody libraries are constructed from different sources, including B cell repertoire derived from an immunized donor (immune libraries) (81, 82), pre-immune repertoires (naive libraries) (81, 83, 84), and synthetic design (synthetic libraries) (85,86). Immune libraries are usually constructed to select a specific antibody against a target antigen in medical research (87) and exhibit more advantages than naive display libraries, including the increased likelihood of selecting antibodies with high affinity/stability, and in vivo affinity maturation (88).\n\nAn advantage of display technologies is its ability to achieve specific antibodies, which can be improved along with recombinant DNA technology and antibody engineering through cloning and expression of a variety of antibody fragments in different expression systems such as bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells (48,(89)(90)(91). Furthermore, complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding antibodies are stable in this method and can be stored for several years (49). In display technologies, the size of the antibody molecule is reduced and only the intact antigen-binding site (paratope) is preserved, such as fragment antigen-binding (Fab), single-chain fragment variable (scFv), and single-domain antibodies (sdAb) (46,49) as presented in Figure 2B. These antibody fragments can eventually improve the antibody's therapeutic properties in terms of better penetration in tumor tissue, faster blood clearance for imaging purposes, lower retention times in nontarget tissue, and inferior immunogenicity. The affinity and specificity of rAbs are similar to conventional antibodies, thus no avidity effect exists (49,92). In addition,",

            "text": "An alternative to the use of traditional immunization to generate antibodies has been the use of in vitro display methods [37] to select antibodies from large na\u00efve or immune libraries. In these techniques, large antibody libraries in either the Fab or single chain Fv (scFv) format [38] are displayed on the surface of filamentous phage [39,40] or yeast [41,42], and antibodies binding targets of interest are purified away from the multitude of non-binding antibodies. Targets are usually immobilized and the binding antibodies separated from non-binding antibodies by a series of washing steps, followed by elution. The selection of antibodies from vast antibody libraries, instead of using animal immunization and hybridoma technology, offers the advantage of guiding the selection process towards antibodies with rare specificities, epitopes or characteristics that are extremely difficult to find with animal-based methods. The key feature of in vitro display systems is that phenotype (the displayed antibody) and genotype (the gene encoding the displayed antibody) are coupled in such a way that selection of an antibody on the basis of its binding activity leads to simultaneous selection of the gene that encodes it. This guarantees the permanent availability of selected clones over time, by virtue of gene synthesis, and also makes it possible to express clones in different antibody formats (e.g., with Fc domains from different species), as well as improve antibody properties, such as affinity. Furthermore, recombinantly expressed antibodies have been shown to be more specific than their hybridoma expressed counterparts, which often express additional immunoglobulin chains that detract from their specificity [43]. \n\nIn general, the larger the library, the higher the affinity of antibodies that can be selected, although this tends to be target specific, with protein targets generally yielding much higher affinities than small targets such as mycolactone. We developed a recombinatorial method [44,45] to create particularly large phage antibody libraries, from which human antibodies against a number of challenging targets have been generated [46][47][48]. Here we describe the application of this approach to select human antibodies recognizing mycolactone.",

The use of yeast display, in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, also allows further refinement of any particular HCDR3 clone set, by, for instance, generating apanel of antibodies with similar structure but different affinities. If yeast display and flow cytometry are not available, we believe asimilar approach can also be applied to phage antibody libraries. In this case, after identified antibody genes are amplified, they would be cloned into acorresponding phage display vector using aGibson assembly 30 (or similar) approach. \n\nThe method described here is amenable only for antibodies displayed as scFvs in the VL-VH orientation, with the HCDR3 present at the 3\u02b9 end of the molecule. In asituation where the molecules are displayed with aVH-VL orientation, the strategy can be optimized around the LCDR3, but, unlike the HCDR3, this is not expected to provide sufficient diversity to distinguish different clones. \n\nBeyond its use for the isolation of NGS identified clones selected from na\u00efve libraries, we believe this approach will also be suitable for other library selections in which NGS is used, such as:1) in error-prone PCR affinity maturation campaigns where preservation of the antibody HCDR3 is important;2) selection from semi-synthetic libraries in which diversity is found in the CDRs embedded within constant scaffolds; or3) in synthetic combinatorial libraries where the CDRs are also synthetically generated. In all these examples the same primer design strategy can be applied to rescue antibodies with HCDR3s of interest, with the advantage that all clones in these libraries will have the same JH region (i.e., of the chosen scaffold for asemi-synthetic library). The power of NGS lies in the ability to analyze the entire depth of an antibody output after aselection campaign. However, the challenge of going rapidly from \"sequence to clone\" has remained aconsistent bottleneck. Our latest approach to overcome this problem, described here, has clear advantages compared to previous methods.",

            "text": "The best matured antibody variant can be isolated by an affinity screening process using a display panning technology such as phage display [12], yeast surface display [13], or ribosome display [14,15].However, for an antibody library including all possible combinations of single and multiple mutations at all CDRs of a usual variable domain, a library size exceeding 10 30 variants would be required, making it infeasible to screen using a common display technology [8].Hot-spot mutagenesis [16], look-through mutagenesis [17], and simultaneous mutagenesis [18] are strategies for improving CDR diversification efficiency and reducing library size.\n\nMutagenesis approaches have been used in several studies to improve the binding affinity of mAbs.Tillotson et al. used the random mutagenesis approach via error-prone PCR followed by yeast surface display screening to isolate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) mutants that target the transferrin receptor (TfR) with a 3-7-fold-improved binding affinity [19].A panel of Fab antibody fragments with up to a 10-fold improvement in affinity to the tetravalent antigen streptavidin were obtained by Beucken et al. after the selection of a yeast-displayed library diversified by error-prone PCR [20].Hu et al. utilized the targeted diversification of multiple CDR regions of a humanized anti-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ErbB2) antibody together with phage display to identify a mutant with a 158-fold-increased affinity [21].\n\nOptimizing the affinity of monospecific antibodies can impact the efficacy of a drug and, therefore, the dose and dosing regimen, limit adverse effects, and significantly reduce therapy costs, making optimal affinity a critical factor of drug discovery [10,22,23].In the case of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), the affinity of the drug needs to be optimized with respect to two targets [24].BsAbs are remarkable therapeutic entities for cancer treatment as they are able to cross-link receptors or block two disease-related signaling pathways [25][26][27].",

            "text": "Thirty years ago George Smith introduced 'phage display' as a means to express vast collections of recombinant proteins and peptides to be screened by affinity selection (1) (a process coined 'biopanning' (2)).Two basic systems evolved: (i) phage display of random peptide libraries and (ii) the production of phage displayed antibodies.The latter has been used extensively to generate human monoclonal antibodies (3)(4)(5)(6), replacing to some extent the production of murine monoclonal antibodies via classical hybridoma technology.The first system, random peptide libraries, was initially applied to the epitope analysis of a specific monoclonal antibody with the ultimate intent of affinity selection of a peptide-mimetic assumed to simulate and represent the cognate epitope of the antibody being studied (7,8).Cortese et al. went on to implement random peptide phage display to study polyclonal sera, demonstrating that pathogen related peptides could be isolated through biopanning peptide-libraries with disease-defining polyclonal serum (9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14).In many cases the application of phage display libraries was performed to clone out a specific peptide or antibody for further development and study.More recently, phage display has also served as the basis for computational prediction of epitope-structures (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21), as reviewed by Sun et al. (22) and for the critical profiling of the repertoire of antibody specificities of polyclonal sera, i.e. profiling the IgOme (23,24), see also (25).\n\nAn implicit assumption in phage displayed based applications is that the library to be screened truly represents an unbiased comprehensive collection of peptides from which affinity selection can proceed.The selected peptides can be taken, therefore, to faithfully represent the structural idiosyncrasies and/or specific binding activities of the antibody (or antibodies) being analyzed.",

            "text": "Phage display libraries can be constructed using antibody variable (v) genes isolated from IgM mRNA of non-immunised human donor B cells derived from diverse lymphoid sources such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), spleen cells, tonsils, bone marrow or from nonimmunised animal B cells (na\u00efve antibody libraries). IgG mRNA from PBLs or spleen cells of immunised animals or human patients are used to build immunised libraries. A third class called synthetic and semi-synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using repertoires of rearranged V genes from gene segments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and introducing variation into their CDR regions using custom degenerate primers encoding for diversity and length [108]. \n\nImmunised libraries are generally constructed using antibody VH and VL genes amplified from the mRNA of B cell pools from immunised animals or human donors. Post immunisation, the antibody secreting B cells possess a higher percentage of antigen specific heavy and light chain gene transcripts. These B cells would have undergone affinity maturation and isotype switching in germinal centres before entering into the peripheral circulation. Typically antibodies isolated from immunised libraries will have a high affinity and tighter specificity for the immunogens used [8] and can be achieved even from relatively small library diversity [108]. \n\nUnlike hybridoma technology, phage display provides researchers with more possibilities to streamlining their monoclonal antibody generation process. The main improvement is the replacement of cell culture screening steps using hybridomas. Instead of screening hundreds or thousands of hybridoma monoclonals to find positive clones, phage display, with carefully designed panning strategies, can screen billions of clones and allow the enrichment of small subsets of binders with desirable characteristics that can be further screened to identify individual binders. Antibodies recognising specific antigenic conformations and epitopes can be easily isolated by introducing selective or subtractive panning steps during the selection process. It has also been reported that using phage display high specificity antibodies can be isolated from immunised sources which would be missed by traditional immunological methods [100].",

Such successes have been responsible for spawning a range of biotechnology companies, as well as many complementary technologies devised to expedite the drug discovery process and resolve bottlenecks in the discovery workflow. Areas covered In this perspective, the authors summarize the application of phage display for drug discovery and provide examples of protein-based drugs that have either been approved or are being developed in the clinic. The amenability of phage display to generate functional protein molecules to challenging targets and recent developments of strategies and techniques designed to harness the power of sampling diverse repertoires are highlighted. Expert opinion Phage display is now routinely combined with cutting-edge technologies to deep-mine antibody-based repertoires, peptide, or alternative scaffold libraries generating a wealth of data that can be leveraged, e.g. via artificial intelligence, to enable the potential for clinical success in the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "Phage has a unique biological feature that allows it to efficiently link the genes coding the phage and the proteins presented on the surface. Such a feature makes phage an excellent tool for antibody screening. Phage display, a technique to study the protein-ligand interaction, has been widely used in laboratories. It is one of the most effective molecular diversity techniques. Phage display is based on the fact that an encapsulated library of genotypes can be directly associated with the presentation of a library of molecules on the phage surface. Phage display has been used in a variety of applications, including epitope mapping-where a library of peptide expressing phage is used to interact with a specific antibody, therefore to pinpoint the specific epitope sequence the antibody is interacting with [112]; ligand identification for receptors-similar to antibody mapping, peptides interacting with receptors can be identified [113]; protein-protein interactionswhere phage can present large proteins that are potentially interacting with a known binding partner, therefore to identify the unknown binding partners and to study the mechanism of interactions [114]; directed evolution of proteins-mutations conferring binding advantages between two proteins can be studied using a phage display library containing these variants [115]; drug discovery-peptides or ligands that can interact with drug targets can be presented through phage display [116]; and antibody screening-where a large library of antibody-displaying phage can be screened for the best antibodies that can interact with the target antigens [117]. \n\nPhage display has recently been used to screen for antibodies that can directly interact with neoantigens specific to cancer cells, thus producing a powerful method for establishing novel cancer therapeutic methods [7]. The screening procedure is conceptually simple. A DNA library encoding a large amount of antibody fragments can be synthesized or obtained, and cloned into phage vectors [118]. Phage carrying a specific DNA sequence can present an antibody or antibody fragment protein on its surface and therefore facilitate potential bindings between the phage and neoantigen targets [119]. When identifying the neoantigen binder phages, there are several critical steps that need to be ensured.",

This technique mimics the natural process of antibody production with increasing affinity for an antigen. A similar effect is attained in laboratory conditions/in vitro by developing second-generation libraries comprising variants of higher affinity to antigen [13]. \n\nThe antibody fragments acquired as result of selection are screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then sequenced to identify the most common variable regions used by the immune system to elicit antibody response. Antibody fragments produced by bacterial colonies are typically purified by affinity chromatography. Through analysis of selected antibodies it is possible to determine the precise constant kinetics of the antigen-antibody binding. \n\nIn the same way scFv format antibodies are produced against haptens, proteins, carbohydrates, receptors, tumor antigens or viruses. They find application in therapy or in a variety of diagnostic kits. \n\nAntibodies for therapeutic/clinical use may also be linked with cytostatic drugs (antibody--drug conjugates, ADCP) or radioisotopes for more effective delivery to target tissues. Phage Display technology is successfully used by many pharmaceutical companies in their scientific quest for biological drugs. Examples of commercially available human therapeutic antibodies obtained with Phage Display technique are: Humira (adalimumab) -an antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) which -among others -is applied in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and Benlysta (belimumab) -human IgG1 directed against the B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), a soluble ligand of the TNF family cytokines, which are used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Under clinical trials are other antibodies from phage libraries [14]. \n\nThe validity and effectiveness of Phage Display technique for obtaining high-specificity human antibodies of therapeutic potential have been confirmed.

            "text": "Filamentous phage display has become an ordinary tool to engineer antibody fragments. Several capsid proteins have been applied for displaying antibodies, of which gene III (p3) protein is used the most followed by experiments with gene IX (p9) protein. Despite the popularity, there are no library scale studies to objectively compare differences in the selection performance of the libraries, when displayed via different capsid proteins. In this study, an identical antibody repertoire was displayed as Fab fragments on p9, p3 and truncated p3 (p3\u0394). In addition, the library clones were displayed as ScFv fragments on p3\u0394 and the Fab-p3 display valency was modulated by hyperphage and VCS-M13 superinfections. The selection performances of the libraries were followed in repeated parallel panning reactions against streptavidin (STR) and digoxigenin (DIG). Selection was successful with all display formats, but the enrichment of specific clones from Fab-p9 library was clearly less efficient than from the other libraries. The most diverse outputs were obtained from p3\u0394 display and the highest affinity anti-DIG antibodies from the ScFv repertoire. Unfortunately, the number of retrieved specific clones was too low for explicit analysis of the differences in the number of obtained unique clones from each library. However, severe reduction in sequence diversity was observed in p3-Fab libraries prior to panning, which in turn, materialized as a low number of unique specific clones. Oligovalent display by hyperphage resulted in a higher number of unique clones, but the same highest affinity anti-DIG Fab was recovered also by VCS-M13 superinfection. The compromised enrichment of the target-specific clones from the Fab repertoire as a fusion to p9 capsid protein in our experiments, the significant loss of functional diversity in Fab-p3 library after single phage packing cycle and the retrieval of higher affinity anti-digoxigenin clones as ScFv molecules than as Fab molecules from the same source repertoire indicate that the chosen display format may have a significant impact on the selection outcome. This study demonstrates that in addition to library content, also display related issues, should be taken into consideration when planning directed evolution experiments.",

            "text": "In this article, we have attempted to reflect on the main problems faced by researchers dealing with phage library construction and the ways of solving them. In our opinion, one of the key problems in the construction of phage antibody libraries is the preparation of the phagemid vector for the insertion of antibody gene diversity, on which the library diversity depends critically. Equally important is amplification and obtaining a purified helper phage preparation, as well as obtaining highly competent cells for electroporation. \n\nDespite these methodological challenges, the phage display technique continues to be successfully developed. This tech- nology is attractive for a number of reasons, including its relative simplicity, the ability to screen large numbers of samples in a short time, and the ability to select antibodies specific to a wide range of antigens. Phage display has opened up new prospects for antibody discovery and development. \n\nApplication of phage libraries of human antibody fragments makes it possible to avoid the use of chimeric or humanized antibodies for therapy, thus avoiding problems associated with the immunogenicity of drugs. We would like to point out that this article is not an ideal guide but may help one solve some problems in obtaining a phage library of antibodies with a large repertoire.",

            "text": "The search for innovative anti-cancer drugs remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, antibodies have emerged as an essential asset in successful cancer therapy. The major obstacle in developing anti-cancer antibodies is the need for non-immunogenic antibodies against human antigens. This unique requirement highlights a disadvantage to using traditional hybridoma technology and thus demands alternative approaches, such as humanizing murine monoclonal antibodies. To overcome these hurdles, human monoclonal antibodies can be obtained directly from Phage Display libraries, a groundbreaking tool for antibody selection. These libraries consist of genetically engineered viruses, or phages, which can exhibit antibody fragments, such as scFv or Fab on their capsid. This innovation allows the in vitro selection of novel molecules directed towards cancer antigens. As foreseen when Phage Display was first described, nowadays, several Phage Display-derived antibodies have entered clinical settings or are undergoing clinical evaluation. This comprehensive review unveils the remarkable progress in this field and the possibilities of using clever strategies for phage selection and tailoring the refinement of antibodies aimed at increasingly specific targets. Moreover, the use of selected antibodies in cutting-edge formats is discussed, such as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) in CAR T-cell therapy or ADC (antibody drug conjugate), amplifying the spectrum of potential therapeutic avenues.",

Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, constitute interesting sources of diversity because they are rich in B cells, part of which can be affinity matured. These organs, however, differ in their anatomical structure, reflecting the different fluids they drain, which affects the B cell repertoires. The CDRH3 repertoires from these organs, extracted from na\u00efve or immunized mice, were compared in the context of phage display libraries using human antibody framework families. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that all libraries displayed different CDRH3 repertoires, but the one derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice was the most diverse. Library performance was assessed by in vitro selection. For both organs, immunization increased substantially the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen. The library derived from lymph nodes from na\u00efve mice, however, was the most effective in generating diverse and high affinity candidates. These results illustrate that the use of a biased CDRH3 repertoire increases the performance of libraries, but reduces the clonal diversity, which may be detrimental for certain strategies.",

            "text": "Immunologists have a long history of studying the diversity of antibodies and antibody-producing cells. First by empirical observation and subsequently through understanding at the molecular level, the basis for antibody diversity is now well understood (1)(2)(3)(4). By contrast, the diversity of antigens recognized by individual antibodies has had limited study (5,6). Polyreactive antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases have been identified, and, in certain cases, the molecular basis for autoreactivity has been linked to unusual antibody structures (e.g. the use of extended CDR3 regions (7,8) or amino acid sequences in the VH region that result in highly charged cationic antibodies that can deposit on basement membranes and cause glomerulonephritis (9)). However, the number and diversity of antigens and epitopes recognized by a given antibody have received very little attention. Previous biomolecule mimotope approaches have often focused on discovery of short peptides as mimetics of polysaccharide, protein, or toxin structures (10,11). Typically, screening approaches utilizing phage display libraries (12) have been employed for identification of peptide leads, with further optimization effected through synthetic manipulations of the sequence. Some instances of synthetic combinatorial libraries for di-and isopeptide mimetics have also been described (13). Although these approaches have generated some measure of success, peptide mimetics of HIV-1 neutralizing antibody targets have thus far not proven to be useful vaccine candidates (14 -16), perhaps because peptide mimetics do not represent highly constrained molecular species. We sought to overcome the problems inherent in peptide-based approaches to developing an HIV-1 mimotope vaccine by searching for small molecule haptens that, when conjugated to a heterologous carrier protein, could potentially elicit antibodies similar in specificity and function to the corresponding monoclonal antibody used to screen for the small molecule itself. D5, an HIV-1-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, is known to bind to a highly conserved hydrophobic pocket within the N-heptad repeat (NHR) 4 region of gp41 (17,18).",

            "text": "In general, the improvements of developability properties in the second-generation libraries were achieved by sequencebased optimization. While our knowledge regarding sequence-based prediction of protein liabilities is still limited, many biophysical properties, such as stability, solubility, and expression, are closely related to higher order structure of a protein. Although scaffolds with high stability and expression can be selected for library construction, the overall biophysical properties of antibodies in a phage library are also highly determined by CDR sequence. Therefore, these developability properties were experimentally improved during construction of the third-generation libraries.\n\nIn order to enhance the library solubility and thermostability, a heat shock step, followed by a protein A recovery, was incorporated in the construction of the semisynthetic ALTHEA Gold library. 101 This is based on the observation that heat denaturation selected stable and well-folded antibodies. 153 Validation of the library showed that the overall frequency of hydrophobic residues at diversified CDR positions decreased after heat shock and protein A selection. In contrast, charged residues were positively selected by the filtration process. By panning the library against a diverse panel of antigens, the scFvs selected exhibited high affinity (K D ranges from single-digit nM to sub-nM), solubility (>50 mg/ L), and thermal stability (Tm > 70\u00b0C), which agree with biophysical parameters of therapeutic antibodies. 101,154,155 In another effort to create a semisynthetic phage library with \"drug-like\" properties, a yeast display filtration was applied to select sequences with optimal developability properties required for clinical development, including affinity, aggregation, thermostability, polyspecificity, and expression level. 102 This step leverages the eukaryotic protein quality control systems for selection of correctly behaving proteins for secretion. [156][157][158] In detail, five single-CDR yeast display libraries, in each of which one CDR (except CDRH3) was synthesized from replicated natural diversity, were individually created. The antibody sequences that were displayed correctly and in a high level were selected and subjected to nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) analysis. CDRH3 sequences, however, were sourced from human natural antibody repertoire",

This method was used to clone a diverse panel of human mAbs in Fab format to tetanus toxoid after generating an antibody library from peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from human donors who had received a booster vaccination. 73,74 A major drawback of this method is its limitation to screening as opposed to selecting antibody libraries. The number of independent clones, i.e., lysis plaques, that can be screened, even if the antigen of interest is in unlimited supply, is practically confined to 10 6 . \n\nSubsequent combinatorial strategies, e.g., phage, yeast and mammalian cell display, replaced screening with selection, allowing the mining of much larger antibody libraries approaching 10 11 independent clones. Selection is facilitated by display technologies that physically link a displayed antibody fragment to its cDNA in a defined particle such as a filamentous phage, a ribosome, or a cell. Millions to billions to, theoretically, trillions of independent particles constitute an antibody library that can be mined with antigens of interest. Particles that display antibody fragments with high affinity to the antigen are isolated. Because of the simultaneous isolation of their cDNA, the displayed antibody fragments can be copied, enabling multiple rounds of selection. In other words, the physical linkage of phenotype and genotype effectively links recognition and replication. In addition, DNA sequencing may readily identify phenotype and genotype. \n\nPhage display.

            "text": "The use of combinatorial phage display scFv libraries for generation of therapeutic antibodies is well established and has resulted in clinically valuable reagents [1,2]. ScFv libraries are commonly made from immune or na\u0131 \u00a8ve B cells or as synthetic libraries where antibody variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) gene segments are rearranged in vitro with synthetic complementarity determining regions (CDRs) coding for random sequences of varying lengths [3][4][5]. The use of the phage display library has been used to develop antibodies for therapeutic intervention using the above combinatorial libraries. We reasoned that the use of antibody engineering in combination with ligand structural studies will result in robust libraries that can lead to isolation of potent ligand-mimetic bio-therapeutic antibody candidates. \n\nSince receptor:ligand interactions must be considered as interacting topographical maps we wondered if it were possible to generate a target-selective library by incorporating a panel of specific three-dimensional shapes into the CDR3 of the variable heavy (V H -CDR3). If such a library used stereochemical shapes that corresponded to a ligand-binding interface then it would more likely generate scFv(s) that will block the ligand:receptor interaction than would a conventional random library. To test this hypothesis we considered a therapeutically relevant target, the integrin avb6, which represents a novel and important tumourselective target that is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. We, and others, have shown that avb6 promotes cancer cell migration, invasion and growth in vivo [6][7][8][9][10]. Moreover strong expression of avb6 correlates with poor prognosis in multiple cancers [11][12][13] and thus human therapeutic antibodies to this integrin are likely to have a significant therapeutic value.",

            "text": "Immunization and subsequent hybridoma technologies are time-consuming and have technical limitations. Therefore, we turned to the use of phage display of a scFv antibody library to enrich for phage antibodies that would be highly specific for both and / or discriminative between the two cell line surfaces. \n\nThe isolation of monoclonal antibodies to specific antigenic targets has been revolutionized by antibody phage display technology [10], which allows for rapid selection and isolation of antibodies to a given target antigen [11]. Phage display has been used to generate antibodies targeting a plethora of antigens [12,13,14,15], showing the usefulness of this methodology. Moreover, phage display has been successfully used to isolate antibodies to more complex sources such as known cell-surface expressed antigens [16,17,18], but also on endothelial cell lines [19,20,21,22], and even vascular tissues in vivo [23,24,25,26], without previous knowledge of the antigens. \n\nThe antibody repertoire displayed by phage particles can be either natural, immunized or non-immune [11,27,28]. Our source of antibody genes was the ETH-2 library, a semi-synthetic phage library displaying human single chain Fv antibodies (scFvs) [29] that contains randomized sequences based on one gene for the heavy, and two genes for the light chains. ETH-2 was previously successfully applied to isolate antibodies against endothelial antigens [29,30,31]. This is the first report of its use to perform screenings on primary human BECs and LECs to generate a catalogue of antibodies against membrane-associated proteins, showing that endothelial cells can be directly used as antigen carriers.",

Antibody clones from synthetic libraries with optimized design features have several distinct advantages that include high stability, high levels of expression, and ease of downstream optimization and engineering. In this study, a fully synthetic human scFv library with six diversified CDRs was constructed by polymerase chain reaction assembly of overlapping oligonucleotides. In order to maximize the functional diversity of the library, a \u03b2-lactamase selection strategy was employed in which the assembled scFv gene repertoire was fused to the 5\u2032-end of the \u03b2-lactamase gene, and in-frame scFv clones were enriched by carbenicillin selection. A final library with an estimated total diversity of 7.6 \u00d7 109, greater than 70% functional diversity, and diversification of all six CDRs was obtained after insertion of fully randomized CDR-H3 sequences into this proofread repertoire. The performance of the library was validated using a number of target antigens, against which multiple unique scFv sequences with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range were isolated.",

            "text": "Since the inception of antibody technology twenty years ago, phage display is a powerful tool to generate antibodies for proteome research [1][2][3][4], diagnostics [5][6][7][8] or for therapeutic purposes [9][10][11]. Therapeutic antibodies are currently one of the fastest developing class of biologicals in the pharmaceutical market [12]. The main indications for therapeutic antibodies are cancer and auto-immune diseases [13,14]. To date, 44 antibodies and antibody conjugates are EMA and/or FDA approved (status autumn 2014) (http://www.imgt.org/mAb-DB/index) and about 350 antibodies and antibody fusion proteins were under development in 2013 [15]. Two major strategies for generating fully human antibodies are: transgenic mice and antibody phage display. In transgenic mice, the chromosome segments encoding antibody gene fragments are replaced with the corresponding human chromosome segments encoding human immunoglobulins. These animals allow the generation of fully human antibodies by hybridoma technology [16][17][18]. An advantage of transgenic mice is the in vivo affinity maturation of antibodies, but on the other hand, all in vivo antibody generations are restricted by the natural immune system itself: The limitation in antigen processing and presentation and the tolerance against conserved epitopes [19]. Antibody phage display is an alternative or complementing technology to generate human antibody fragments from universal antibody gene libraries as lead candidates for therapeutic development [17,[20][21][22]. Here, the selection is an in vitro process and is not limited by the restrictions of the immune system and selection conditions can be adjusted and controlled, thus allowing to select for properties not achievable by in vivo immune systems [23]. To isolate human antibodies by phage display, two types of antibody gene libraries are used: immune libraries and universal or \"single-pot\" libraries [24,25]. Immune libraries from patients are suited to select specific antibodies against a disease or pathogen, e.g. cancer [26,27], human immunodeficiency virus [28]or herpes simplex virus [29].",

Also, a phage display library cannot take on the effective mutation and recombination in vitro, which in turn limits the genetic diversity of the molecules in the library (72,73). Nevertheless, these temporary shortcomings cannot obscure the great potential of its applications. \n\nClinical therapeutic applications. Nowadays, with the establishment of more phage display libraries, the construction of advanced genetic operating system and the development of more efficient phage display systems, phage display technology plays an important role in different fields, especially in protein and antibody-related fields (34). Phage display technology has become an advantageous tool for detecting the protein spatial structure, exploring the binding sites between receptors and ligands, and searching for ligands with high affinity and biological activity (74). It has had a far-reaching impact on research into the mutual recognition of protein molecules, the preparation of phage-functionalised biosensors, the development of new vaccines and tumour therapy (75,76). In addition, Humira, ramucirumab and other mAbs developed by phage display technology have been widely used in clinical practice, especially Humira, which is widely applied in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and uveitis (45).",

While these methods aim to reduce development time and resources, building reliable models capable of designing high-quality focused antibody libraries remains an aspirational goal, with ongoing research aimed at refining these predictive models. \n\nDL models excel in predicting molecular interactions by training on diverse structural and sequence datasets. They can precisely predict how modifications to an antibody's sequence influence its interaction with antigens, extending to modelling interactions under various physiological conditions. (230). \n\nML can refine library design and screening processes in mammalian display, where stable, site-specific integration of antibody variants allows early screening of highly developable antibodies (50,56). However, due to its small library size (10 6 -10 7 ) compared to phage display (10 10 -10 11 ), the mammalian display is commonly used for affinity maturation and antibody engineering or to screen whole outputs from phage display in IgG format. AI-enhanced tools can be used to create more focused semisynthetic human or humanised mammalian display libraries de novo with library sizes of 10 3 -10 6 sequences optimised to exhibit optimal expression levels, stability, solubility, and low immunogenicity (225). \n\nIn the context of VHH antibodies derived from llama or other camelid sources, AI/ML have been instrumental in reducing immunogenicity and improving developability, enhancing humanization processes while maintaining high affinity and specificity (231). Techniques such as computational CDR grafting, enhanced by ML algorithms, predict the impact of modifications on binding and immunogenic profile (232,233). BioPhi, an opensource platform for antibody design [(https://biophi.dichlab.org and https://github.com/Merck/BioPhi, date accessed: 22nd of July 2024)], automates humanisation and evaluates the humanness of sequences, representing a significant step in automating antibody library design to produce therapeutics less likely to elicit an immune response (233).",

Therefore, a technology that produces a diverse, screenable library of human antibodies appears to be well suited for producing therapeutics. \n\nPlatforms utilizing phage or yeast display of antibodies or antibody fragments enable screening against a large library, yet the antibody proteins are not expressed by mammalian cells and may differ in folding or post-translational modifications. Conversely, recombinant animal models are capable of producing full-length human IgG from mammalian cells, but the library is limited to antigens that elicit an immune response by the mouse. The Immunologix platform combines the best characteristics of each technology. By enriching na\u00efve B cells from a robust source and transforming at high efficiency, large and diverse libraries of human antibody variable regions are created. Stimulating differentiation ex vivo further increases the potential diversity, which ongoing research is more precisely measuring. For example, an antibody reactive with Ricin B chain was also previously isolated, 31 indicating that the process elicits antibodies against antigens to which the subjects were not previously exposed. Since the antibodies generated are full-length human IgG expressed from human cells, the native conformation is retained. With this novel technology, human antibodies can be generated against virtually any antigen, making advances in antibody therapeutics attainable.",

The innovative strategy of mAb screening, utilizing phage display, facilitates the in vitro screening of antibodies with high affinity to target antigens. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is a subset of mAb derivatives, known for its high binding affinity and smaller size\u2014just one-third of that of human IgG. This report outlines a detailed and comprehensive procedure for constructing a scFv phagemid library derived from human patients, followed by screening via phage display affinity selection. The protocol utilizes 348 primer combinations spanning the entire human antibody repertoire to minimize sequence bias and maintain library diversity during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for scFv generation, resulting in a library size greater than 1 \u00d7 108. Furthermore, we describe a high-throughput phage display screening protocol using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate more than 1200 scFv candidates. The generation of a highly diverse scFv library, coupled with the implementation of a phage display screening methodology, is expected to provide a valuable resource for researchers in pursuit of scFvs with high affinity for target antigens, thus advancing both research and clinical endeavors.",

            "text": "Fully human therapeutic antibodies emerged in the 1990s with the development of two technology platforms: human antibody Fv or Fab phage-display libraries (12) and transgenic animals bearing the human antibody repertoire (14). Eleven antibodies listed in Table 1 have been discovered using these platforms. Of note, only three: necitumumab, ramucirumab, avelumab were obtained using phage display. Although phage display was developed prior to transgenic animals, the latter requires less optimization and thus shorter timelines to reach clinical development (91). In addition, since enriching technologies such as phage display are based on in vitro selection, the antibody fragments coming out of the selection and screening processes do not undergo the in vivo selection process and tend to carry developability liabilities (discussed below). \n\nTwo transgenic mice produced the fully human antibodies approved for oncology indications, e.g., Medarex (14) and Abgenix (16). The first therapeutic antibody developed by one of these platforms was panitumumab. This therapeutic antibody was obtained using the XenoMouse \u00ae (92). Durvalumab was discovered using the same platform (93), whereas, the other five antibodies listed in Table 1 were discovered using the Medarex technology. Interestingly, four of the Medarex antibodies share the same VL, IGKV3-11*01, with three of them in the germline gene configuration and one (nivolumab) with only one mutation at the CDR-L3 (Figure 4). Although the Medarex mouse has only a small fraction of the complete human VH and VL repertoires, it demonstrated that even with limited diversity, the plasticity of VL to pair with diverse VH chains can generate specific and high affinity therapeutic antibodies against unrelated targets. Other transgenic mice have been developed in the last three years including the Kymouse (94) and the Trianni mouse (95). These platforms rely on more diverse repertoires of human antibody genes, which enable the selection of highly diverse human antibodies and circumvent some of the limitations of the early transgenic mice.",

Immunized libraries require antigen injections in camelid species to generate antibodies against specific epitopes, (5) while na\u00efve libraries necessitate a large number of animals and fresh blood samples to construct sufficiently large nanobody libraries. \n\n(10) Synthetic libraries rely on artificial sequence synthesis to mimic natural antibody features, yet they often exhibit weaker physicochemical properties and require extended development periods. Although mature experimental screening techniques such as phage display and yeast display are available, they remain costly, time-consuming, and laborintensive, with limited capacity to produce antibodies targeting specific epitopes. As a result, developing more efficient and precise antibody screening methods has become a key research focus. \n\nRecent computational approaches have introduced new perspectives in antibody development. Synthetic libraries typically rely on extracted features from natural sequences to generate artificial sequences, thus eliminating the need for animal immunization and reducing both cost and development time. (11,12) However, synthetic sequences are still different from natural sequences in terms of physicochemical properties. (10) Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (13) have demonstrated significant potential in antibody design, with success in the generation of peptide and protein sequences. (14,15) Previous studies have shown that CDR3 grafting can achieve affinity transfer, (16) and recent efforts have demonstrated that de novo design of antibody CDR3 sequences can enable binding to target proteins. (17) These findings underscore the promising future of generating natural-like CDR3 sequences for target protein binding. \n\nIn this study, we propose a GAN-based method for de novo design of nanobody CDR3 sequences. We developed a generative model, AiCDR, capable of producing natural-like CDR3 sequences, which we grafted onto a humanized antibody scaffold to construct a library of approximately 10 4 nanobody structures. Through computational screening, we identified nanobody candidates capable of binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 S protein, ultimately isolating ten candidates. Functional assays confirmed that two of these nanobodies exhibited neutralization activity against the Omicron S protein.",

            "text": "Display technologies, such as phage, yeast and ribosome display are important tools in the identification of therapeutic antibodies. 1 In particular, phage display is widely used at several stages of the drug discovery process. Phage library diversity can be derived from na\u00efve human B cells, 2 synthetic engineered antibody sequences 3 or from B cell-rich tissue of immunized animals; 4 libraries generated by the latter method are often referred to as immune phage display libraries. Immune phage display offers several advantages over na\u00efve or synthetic display approaches, increasing the likelihood of isolating stable, high-affinity specific antibodies due to pre-enrichment and in-vivo affinity maturation. 5 Traditional isolation of antibodies from phage display libraries involves multiple rounds of panning followed by screening and sequencing of positive clones. A key limitation when identifying clones is the screening step following enrichment. Selecting clones can be technically challenging and time consuming, and the process is often hampered by dominant clones within the enriched population, which makes it difficult to identify alternative binders with lower representation within the pool.\n\nDespite recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, sequence read length is a limitation in their application to phage display screening. The majority of NGS platform technologies allow a maximum read length of up to 500 base pair (bp), 6 which has extensively been used for the analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig)-repertoires in several species. This length, however, is not sufficient to cover a full singlechain variable fragment (scFv) sequences. 7,8 Currently, sequencing of the entire variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) fragment of a single chain is not routinely carried out and is not possible using conventional NGS platforms. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing allows the contiguous sequencing of fragments of up to 8500 bp, 9 but read length comes at the expense of sequence fidelity. 10 A recent advance in SMRT sequencing is the addition of hairpin loops to double-stranded DNA fragments. 11 Consensus sequencing of adaptor ligated fragments can increase the sequence accuracy of an 850 bp fragment (the approximate length of an average scFv) to 99.99%. 12 Hemadou et al. first demonstrated this approach to be effective at accurately identifying full-length scFvs in an enriched fully human,",

            "text": "BackgroundFilamentous phage display has become an ordinary tool to engineer antibody fragments. Several capsid proteins have been applied for displaying antibodies, of which gene III (p3) protein is used the most followed by experiments with gene IX (p9) protein. Despite the popularity, there are no library scale studies to objectively compare differences in the selection performance of the libraries, when displayed via different capsid proteins.ResultsIn this study, an identical antibody repertoire was displayed as Fab fragments on p9, p3 and truncated p3 (p3\u0394). In addition, the library clones were displayed as ScFv fragments on p3\u0394 and the Fab-p3 display valency was modulated by hyperphage and VCS-M13 superinfections. The selection performances of the libraries were followed in repeated parallel panning reactions against streptavidin (STR) and digoxigenin (DIG). Selection was successful with all display formats, but the enrichment of specific clones from Fab-p9 library was clearly less efficient than from the other libraries. The most diverse outputs were obtained from p3\u0394 display and the highest affinity anti-DIG antibodies from the ScFv repertoire. Unfortunately, the number of retrieved specific clones was too low for explicit analysis of the differences in the number of obtained unique clones from each library. However, severe reduction in sequence diversity was observed in p3-Fab libraries prior to panning, which in turn, materialized as a low number of unique specific clones. Oligovalent display by hyperphage resulted in a higher number of unique clones, but the same highest affinity anti-DIG Fab was recovered also by VCS-M13 superinfection.ConclusionsThe compromised enrichment of the target-specific clones from the Fab repertoire as a fusion to p9 capsid protein in our experiments, the significant loss of functional diversity in Fab-p3 library after single phage packing cycle and the retrieval of higher affinity anti-digoxigenin clones as ScFv molecules than as Fab molecules from the same source repertoire indicate that the chosen display format may have a significant impact on the selection outcome. This study demonstrates that in addition to library content, also display related issues, should be taken into consideration when planning directed evolution experiments.",

            "text": "The antibody phage display technology, initially reported in 1990 (McCafferty et al., 1990), is considered a powerful tool to generate mAbs (Fig. 1). The methodology, based on the phage display concept described by George Smith in 1985 (Smith, 1985), consists in the development of a combinatorial antibody phage librarythat is, a huge collection of phages displaying antibody fragmentsand the subsequent screening of the antibodies that recognize the antigen of interest. \n\nTo generate an antibody phage library, firstly it is necessary to clone antibody gene fragments into vectors. Both filamentous M13 phage and phagemid, which combines the characteristics of plasmids and phages (Tikunova and Morozova, 2009), can be used as vectors. Comparatively, while the first one has all the ability to produce phage particles and display antibody, the phagemid needs to infect bacteria with a helper phage, that is required to package the phagemid as single-strand DNA into virion particle (Barbas et al., 1991;Lowman, 2013;Almagro et al., 2019). In both cases, vectors are used to transform E. coli by electroporation. After obtaining the phage display library, the antibodies displayed on the vector surface are screened through a process called biopanning (Wu et al., 2016). It should be noted that the antibodies are most often displayed in single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or antigen-binding fragment (Fab) forms. \n\nThere are four types of antibody display libraries: immune, na\u00efve, semisynthetic, and synthetic. The immune libraries are obtained from immunized animals or humans and are mostly used to discover antibodies against infectious pathogens (Trott et al., 2014) or antigenic targets in cancer patients (Thie et al., 2011;Frenzel et al., 2016).",

            "text": "These platforms rely on more diverse repertoires of human antibody genes, which enable the selection of highly diverse human antibodies and circumvent some of the limitations of the early transgenic mice. \n\nDespite the success of transgenic mice as a source of therapeutic antibodies, immunization does not always lead to antibodies with the desired antibody affinity and specificity (96,97). This is particularly true for conserved epitopes between human and mouse orthologs. Transgenic rats (98) and more recently chickens (OmniChicken) (99) may partially mitigate this limitation. Nonetheless, toxic targets and selection of proteins with specific active conformations in environments of interest for a given MOA are not well suited for an immunization approach and require an alternative solution for antibody discovery. \n\nPhage display opened the possibility of designing and manipulating the repertoire of antibody genes to be used as source of antibodies (24), thus, leading to selection of fully antibodies in vitro. Since the discovery process via phage display is performed in vitro one can also choose the optimal conditions to select for desired biophysical and biochemical properties, target pre-defined epitopes locked in specific conformations, avoid immunodominant epitopes by masking them with other known antibodies and/or focus the selection of rare or cross-reactive epitopes. \n\nFor instance, ramucirumab was developed starting from three antibodies with identical VH sequence isolated from de Haard and collaborators' Fab display library (100). These antibodies bound specifically the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), blocked the VEGF/KDR interaction, and inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of human endothelial cells and migration of KDR leukemia cells. A new library was built by combining the single VH with a repertoire of na\u00efve VL chains, and diverse and specific VL chains for VEGFR2 were selected. Then, a consensus VH:VL pair, termed 1121, was identified after selection tailoring the stringency of the panning conditions to obtain picomolar binders (101). \n\nNecitumumab was also isolated from de Haard and collaborators' library by using A431 carcinoma cells, which express high levels of EGFR.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are now widely used for the treatment of many different diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, infection, migraine and, atherosclerosis. By the end of 2018, there were 87 monoclonal antibodies approved in the US and/or Europe, grossing annual revenues of ~$100B (see ref. 1 and www.antibodysociety.org), making monoclonal antibodies the fastest growing drug class, and representing half of all worldwide biopharmaceutical sales. Over 150 biotech and pharmaceutical companies are currently discovering or developing antibody drugs, and the high growth rate is in part due to the higher and faster approval rates for antibodies compared to other drugs. 2 This reflects their straightforward development pathways, high tolerance and relatively low risks of unexpected safety issues in most human clinical trials, immunotherapy excluded. \n\nIn vitro antibody selection platforms such as phage and yeast display assist the development of human recombinant antibodies against virtually any desired antigen or epitope that may have arelevant biological function. 3 This, in turn, accelerates the discovery process and helps the continuous expansion of the range of diseases that can be treated with these molecules. Na\u00efve phage antibody libraries generated from the B-cells of nonimmune human donors contain antibodies with the potential to recognize all possible antigen types, including human. The technology has been successfully used in the development of U.S.Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs such as adalimumab (AbbVie/Humira\u00ae), necitumumab (Eli Lilly/Portrazza\u00ae), ramucirumab (Eli Lilly/Cyramza\u00ae). During the lead generation phase of drug discovery, antibodies are commonly displayed on the surface of filamentous phage particles either as antigen-binding fragments (Fab) or as asingle-chain variable fragment (scFv) domains, 4 which consist of the antibody heavy and light chain variable regions connected by alinker peptide that preserves the binding properties of the antibody. \n\nWhen using invitro display, one of the concerns is that the total diversity of antibodies found in these libraries may not be fully tapped during selections.",

            "text": "Over the past three decades, monoclonal antibodies have become the market's most important class of therapeutic biologicals. Monoclonal antibodies were initially produced by the hybridoma method, in use since 1975 [22], but emerging recombinant DNA technologies have allowed the humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies and made them suitable for the treatment and diagnosis of chronic conditions including cancer and autoimmune diseases [23]. In addition, molecular engineering approaches, including phage-display technology, enable the expression of antibody libraries on filamentous phages to generate antigen-specific candidates [24]. Phage display enables the production of small recombinant antibody fragments such as Fab or ScFvs [25]. ScFvs are non-natural small antibody formats (~25 kDa, monomeric) resulting from genetic engineering, and are well-expressed in bacterial and phage systems. Phage immune libraries, notably ScFv, have demonstrated their power for discovering high-affinity binders against various types of targets [25]. \n\nDimeric ScFvs, called diabodies (~50 kDa), are engineered antibody fragments that have already been demonstrated by several teams as useful for developing agents in tumorimaging applications [24][25][26][27], and include the monomeric ScFv [28]. In these previous works [24][25][26][27], imaging agents were taken from full antibody candidates against HER2 and CD20, and were reformatted as Cys-diabodies (Cys-Db). These engineered small dimeric fragments were subjected to site-specific conjugation followed by radiolabeling, and were successfully used as tumor tracers in PET applications [24,26]. These studies demonstrated that Cys-Db approaches could be applied to antibodies against cell surface biomarkers. \n\nTo our knowledge, and surprisingly, no research has yet used phage-display technology, especially the ScFv immune libraries approach, to generate small antibody fragments usable as imaging agents. ScFv phage-display libraries offer the huge advantage of directly selecting candidates with a format close to the desired final type (in our case, Cys-ScFv or Cys-diabody).",

            "text": "Phage display technology is proven to be extremely practical for engineering antibody libraries. It provides a powerful tool for the high-throughput generation of affinity antibodies using an easy procedure. However, the antibody conformation may be altered during the panning process. Thus, constructing a phage library with larger capacity and diversity is necessary for the screening of specific antibodies, which largely depends on the quality of the constructed antibody library [27,28]. \n\nPrevious studies constructed phage libraries directly from PBMCs of patients with HFRS. In our study, we enriched B cells from PBMCs by transforming PBMCs to BLCLs. Although EBV-transformed human BLCLs can secrete some human antibodies, the amount of secreted antibodies is small, and their quality is unstable, which creates difficulties in the preparation and acquisition of antibodies that result in limited clinical application prospects [22]. Unlike the natural phage antibody libraries, which are derived from unimmunized human or animal B lymphocytes, phage immune antibody libraries prepared from B lymphocytes of immunized humans or animals have no requirement for a large library capacity to obtain specific antibodies. Hence, we used BLCLs from 35 Nab-positive patients with HFRS and vaccinated people to construct the human immune antibody library and, thereby, ensure the diversity of antibody gene sources. During the construction of a phage antibody library, the capacity of the antibody library should exceed 10 14 if all highly diverse VH and VL domains are randomly paired. However, it is reported that the capacity of antibody libraries is typically between 10 4 and 10 9 [29]. The next important step is to amplify as many antibody genes as possible to increase the library capacity and maintain diversity. \n\nThe amplified VH, VL, CL and CH1 domains were assembled into Fab fragments, which were cloned into the phage expression vector pHIAT 3 (Figure S2). E. coli TG1 was transformed via electroporation, and the number of clones was calculated to construct a human Fab phage antibody gene library with a library capacity of 1.3 \u00d7 10 9 . The primary phage antibody library had a titer of 1.0 \u00d7 10 13 PFU/mL.",

            "text": "Consequently, a majority of the antibodies developed today are owned by these companies with proprietary access to the underlying technologies. While many patents have expired in Europe and the United States, there is a notable opportunity for academic groups or startups to create their libraries and contribute to the development of antibodies as translational products. Encouragingly, some companies, such as Bio-Rad, now provide cost-effective antibody discovery services. Conversely, some phage display antibody libraries established prior to 2010 remain accessible to academic laboratories, notably at The University of Cambridge and the Scottish Biologics Facility. Of note among these libraries are Tomlinson's libraries, which have yielded high-affinity antibodies for numerous targets [92,93]. \n\nAntibody engineering through phage-display technology is a powerful but intricate process, facing several challenges that researchers have actively addressed to enhance its efficacy. One significant difficulty lies in achieving optimal binding affinities and specificities. The diverse and complex nature of target antigens often necessitates the meticulous optimization of phage display conditions to isolate antibodies with the desired properties. This involves multiple rounds of selection, sometimes requiring extensive screening and affinity maturation to enhance the binding capabilities of the displayed antibodies. Meanwhile, the issue of immunogenicity poses another obstacle in antibody engineering [13]. Antibodies derived from non-human sources, like murine antibodies, may trigger an immune response in humans. Humanization techniques, involving the grafting of CDRs onto human frameworks, have been developed to mitigate this challenge and create antibodies with reduced immunogenic potential [94]. Additionally, achieving functional antibodies with diverse isotypes and formats adds complexity to the engineering process. Scientists have explored different display formats, such as scFvs or Fab fragments, to optimize the selection of antibodies based on their intended applications [23]. Advancements in screening and selection methodologies have significantly improved the efficiency and throughput of antibody discovery using phage display. Techniques such as high-throughput screening, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and next-generation sequencing allow for the rapid identification and characterization of antibodies with desired binding specificities and functional properties. Moreover, advances in library construction, selection methodologies, and molecular design have significantly improved the efficiency of isolating antibodies with high affinity, specificity, and reduced immunogenicity.",

            "text": "The antibody library is a powerful tool for the discovery and development of targetspecific antibodies for a wide range of applications.This includes not only research into the structure and function of proteins and pathological mechanisms of diseases but also into the development of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions [7,37].Thus, the construction of a high-quality library with a larger and more diverse antibody repertoire is essential for increasing the chances of finding high-affinity antibodies with various paratopes that bind to the diverse epitopes of target antigens [38][39][40].In this study, following in vitro immunization of hPBMCs, we constructed a large human combinatorial scFv library and comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of the newly constructed library using NGS.Finally, isolation and biochemical characterization of phage display-derived human scFvs specific to two therapeutically relevant target antigens, including the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.2 and immune checkpoint protein CD155, were conducted for the quality assessment of the library.\n\nTraditionally, mAbs with high affinity and selectivity have been generated from an antibody library, produced by the conventional immunization of animals with diverse antigens [7,41,42].However, the method is labor-intensive and time-consuming and requires the additional establishment of a recombinant antibody library.Further, the mAbs derived from animals also have a higher immunogenicity risk, a major hurdle in the development of therapeutic antibodies [6].To overcome this hurdle, a human na\u00efve or synthetic antibody library has been constructed to isolate target-specific human antibodies [43][44][45].Although vaccination in humanized mouse models is also used as another reliable method for the generation of human mAbs, based on our previous work and similar reports by others, phage display-based antibody selection from an established antibody library can considered a faster and more efficient approach to isolating human recombinant mAbs than the antibody selection from the immune library [8,46,47].Therefore, we believe that the antibody phage display library generated in this study may be widely used as a novel rapid screening platform to select target-specific phage display-derived mAbs for use in multiple applications.",

To differentiate the influenza virus subtypes, we established a panel of antibodies with distinct binding patterns to the respective NP of the representative influenza viruses. A novel procedure schematically depicted in Fig. 1B was used for discovering antibodies for sandwich ELISA capable of detecting and distinguishing NPs from diverse influenza virus strains. Specifically, for each of the target NPs, the antibody discovery procedure in Fig. 1B started by 3 rounds of standard phage display selection 9 , using 16 GH synthetic antibody libraries 7 respectively (Step 1 in Fig. 1B). The technical details of the construction of the general purpose GH phage-displayed synthetic antibody libraries and the standard procedure for phage-displayed antibody library selection and screening against the recombinant antigens have been documented in our previous publications [7][8][9] . The outcomes of the phage display selections are shown in Supplementary Figure S3. The selected phage-displayed libraries after 2 or 3 rounds of selection cycle with polyclonal scFv secretions in the culture media showing positive responses to the corresponding antigen with ELISA, as marked by the arrows in the panels of Supplementary Figure S3B, were expected to contain enriched candidate scFv populations binding to the corresponding antigen.",

Line 40: The statement \"...but unnatural heavy and light chain pairing poses challenges in developability and affinity\" is not correct. In fact, the random combination of heavy and light chains is one of the main advantages of antibody phage display compared to animal immunization-based methods. B cells have very limited opportunities for heavy and light chain pairing. In fact, B cells can only produce two rearranged versions of the light chain per heavy chain, rather than the millions of combinations possible in phage display). So this is clearly not a limitation but an advantage. The importance of this factor is underlined by all the studies in which chain shuffling was used. They clearly show that simply by choosing a better matching natural LC sequence, significant increases in affinity and stability can be achieved without the need to introduce even a single point mutation. line 58, sentence \"Peripheral blood..\" is duplicated line 95 \"Further discussion..\" sentence is unnecessary. line 138, \"..generated using the method described in the Materials and Methods section\" It would be more helpful for the reader if this method could simply be named instead.

Similar biological libraries such as mRNA-display, yeast-display and ribosomal-display technologies has been also developed but most frequently applied in therapeutic drug development (Gal\u00e1n et al. 2016). Only peptides made up of natural amino acids can be tested with these biological libraries.\n\nOn the other hand, synthetic combinatorial libraries allowed the incorporation of non-natural amino acids as well as many structural modifications increasing the diversity.\n\nTo obtain synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries, a \"pre-mix\" strategy was developed in which all the building blocks (natural or unnatural protected amino acids) are mixed in a predetermined molar ratio, which compensates for their different kinetics rates (Pinilla et al. 1992(Pinilla et al. , 1994Ostresh et al. 1994). For their screening and the identification of peptide hits deconvolution methods such as iterative deconvolution (Wilson-Lingardo et al. 1996) and positional scanning (Pinilla et al. 1992) have been developed.",

From these libraries, with a diversification as low as 4 amino acid, specific Fab antibodies with single digit nano molar affinities have been selected for different antigens (e.g., VEGF) [87].

            "text": "The phage display technique consists of the expression of peptides, proteins, or antibody fragments on the surface of phage particles (56). The nucleotide sequence encoding the target protein is found in the phage genome fused to the gene sequence of a coat protein. This fusion ensures that during phage assembly, the target protein will be exposed on the surface of the mature phage while the sequence encoding it is contained in the same phage particle. Using phage display, the analysis of a library of nucleotide sequences with a diversity of millions or billions becomes the study of the corresponding population of exposed protein sequences that can be selected according to the desired properties. \n\nAnalysis of phage display libraries typically includes a panning selection step in which phage populations are exposed to the targets of interest to selectively capture the phages that have bound to them. Through successive rounds of binding, washing, elution, and amplification, the initial population made up of a great diversity of phages are enriched in those that can bind to the target in question. Since the phenotype of each protein carries its genotype inside the phage particle, once the proteins of interest have been isolated, the sequence encoding them can be easily determined and altered to manipulate or refine their binding properties. Currently, natural and synthetic peptides, proteins, and protein domains, as well as recombinant antibodies, are routinely expressed by phage display (56). The phage display technique constitutes a good system for the selection of antibodies or peptides with specific binding properties among a wide number of variants. \n\nNovel biomarkers can be identified by screening phage-display peptide libraries with sera from autoimmune disease patients. A complementary strategy is to construct a phage display library from B-cells from autoimmune disease patients to identify antibody sequences that recognize human epitopes.",

            "text": "To bypass the limitations in polyclonal and monoclonal antibody generation, several groups have turned to in vitro display technologies such as phage display, ribosome display, or yeast display libraries to generate recombinant antibodies. The more recent technologies of yeast and ribosome display are becoming highly established, but phage display is currently the most robust, well characterized, and reliable of these methods. Antibodies derived from these technologies are cloned in microbial hosts and are therefore monoclonal from the start, with their production being easily scaled up. Critically, selection and screening efforts can be directed toward specifi c epitopes or species cross-reactivity and away from polyspecifi c binding. Phage display allows a researcher to do in a single tube what would be unfathomable in traditional hybridoma work: interrogate libraries of millions to tens of billions of antibodies on the basis of their binding specifi cally to a target of interest. \n\nAll of this is possible due to the ingenious concept of \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage,\" which is exemplifi ed by phage display. Phage display was originally described as a rapid method for cloning gene fragments that encode a specifi c protein [ 5 ]. By cloning gene fragments into the genome of a fi lamentous E. coli bacteriophage, Smith et al. were able to generate libraries of gene fusions with the key phage coat protein p3. After transformation into E. coli , the viral replication system packaged the genome (and therefore the cloned gene) into a highly stable complex carrying the gene product on the tip of the phage particle, as a fusion protein with p3 . By subsequently selecting expressed virions on an immobilized antibody with specifi city for a known protein that had been cloned in the phage genome, they were able to show 1000-fold enrichment of the gene product. This set of experiments showed that \"genotypeto-phenotype linkage\" could be achieved and thereby defi ned the basis of all display technologies developed since.",

Moreover, antibodies that display these poor in vitro characteristics can be lost during the selection process due to poor expression, decreasing the effective library size and excluding potential high-affinity binders. Here, we show that the use of framework libraries derived from naturally occurring somatic mutations can rescue antibody stability that is lost during the therapeutic discovery process. In addition to providing solutions to move antibodies into clinical development, it may be advantageous to include this framework diversity in the library design, allowing sampling of the full library diversity as well as selection of antibodies with improved in vitro properties. Now that we have simplified the bacterial display process, it makes it an attractive tool for use in many applications. In the antibody community, it could be used with larger libraries for Fc-engineering, antibody discovery, or affinity maturation. The limitations of library size while screening with FACS could be overcome by using a pre-enriched phage library 41 . Beyond antibodies, our BAD system could be applicable as a general high throughput tool to study protein export, folding, or localization in the E. coli periplasm, as it offers a true readout in a cellular host environment. A major strength of our system is the non-tethered approach that now allows use of the native protein format, making fusion partners, reporter proteins, or membrane tethers unnecessary 42,43 . Furthermore, our live cell setting approach now enables the rapidly evolving field of genomic engineering to screen for desired host characteristics, something that was unattainable with previous display technologies.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of hybridoma (K\u00f6hler and Milstein, 1975), new perspectives have been launched in the field of antibody research and clinical development. Although promising results have been achieved, as advances in molecular tools and the disadvantages of hybridoma were more evident, new alternatives for antibody development were pursued. Due to its characteristics, display selection technologies have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods. Nowadays, phage display is the most widespread and powerful display technology to select antibodies and peptides. Barderas and Benito-Pe\u00f1a (2019) awarded with the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the development of phage display for peptides and antibodies. The phage display created a fast route for the approval and development of molecules selected by this technique. The biggest advantage of this display method is the linkage between phenotype and encapsulated genotype (Tan et al., 2016). Furthermore, the use of phage display facilitates the cloning process due to the phage's genome small size and the high efficiency of phage infection. There are still other advantages that can be associated with this methodology, such as the small size of the phages, easy manipulation, safety, low cost of phage preparation and propagation, and the possibility of high-throughput screening of peptides and antibodies (B\u00e1b\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 2013). Additionally, upon the construction of the phage library, phages can been screened against any target antigen within several weeks (Greenwood et al., 1991). However, as with all techniques there are some pitfalls. The capacity of the phage display library and its molecular diversity is limited since it depends on bacterial transformation, phage packing and transmembrane secretion processes (Shim, 2017). Furthermore, the expression system is also limited because not all the sequences can be efficiently expressed in phages, considering that certain proteins require the correct folding to acquire its functions (Alfaleh et al., 2020). Nevertheless, phage display continues to be considered the best tool to detect the protein spatial structure, exploring binding sites between receptors and ligands, as well as the search for ligands with high affinity and biological activity.",

This reduces the diversity to 10 5 -10 6 , which is compatible with yeast display cloning, and allows further precise sorting to restrict reactivity to those clones recognizing the target of interest. The diversity of the polyclonals after selection was assessed by deep sequencing, with analysis restricted to the HCDR3 because of read length limitations. The number of different HCDR3s selected against the test antigens ranges from 74 to 460 (Table 3), with the actual number of different antibodies likely to be significantly higher when different V L chains and additional V H mutations are taken into account. \n\nIn the single antigen (ubiquitin) in which we assessed the binding abilities of individual monoclonals, all antibodies tested recognized ubiquitin, even down to the least abundant tested antibody, which was present at only 0.04%. This suggests that the vast majority are specific for the target. This depth of diversity allows the removal of cross-reactive clones without significantly affecting the number of different clones: even when antibodies cross-reactive with CTBP1 (or CTBP2) are eliminated, over 90 HCDR3 clusters remain. This great diversity may reflect the relatively high target concentrations we used for selection and sorting, which are expected to eliminate binding discrimination between, and so equalize binding of, low and high affinity antibodies. This may also explain the unexpected finding that there was no correlation between antibody affinity and abundance rank (Fig. 2C). Although we used high target concentrations to increase antibody variety, the unexpectedly high diversity obtained indicates that we could probably improve mean antibody affinity without compromising functional polyclonality, by reducing target concentrations during selection. In preliminary experiments (data not shown), we find a much closer correlation between antibody affinity and rank abundance when target concentrations are significantly reduced. Within the context of future genome scale projects, this will facilitate the ready isolation of high quality sequence defined monoclonals from these polyclonal pools without the need for extensive screening. \n\nConceptually, our approach is superficially similar to recombinant polyclonal antibodies, 33 created by the cloning of Fabs from selected immune phage libraries into mammalian expression vectors. 34",

Phage Display. Phage display technology uses bacteriophages, a type of virus that infects bacteria, as a vehicle for displaying and selecting target proteins on their surface ( Figure  5). The target protein, such as an antibody or a peptide, is genetically fused to the phage surface protein and displayed on the phage's surface. Through various selection and amplification steps, the phage display allows for the efficient identification of high-affinity target proteins with specific binding properties.

The phage display technology utilizes bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, to display peptides or proteins on their surface. This allows for the rapid screening of large numbers of variants and the selection of those that specifically bind to a target molecule. The antibodies generated through phage display can then be used for various applications such as diagnostic tests, drug discovery, and basic research. 28 Phagedisplayed antibody libraries are widely used for screening highaffinity antibodies against various targets including fibronectin, HPV16E7 virus, epidermal growth factor, and other proteins.\n\nThe phage display technology allows for the rapid and efficient selection of highly specific and high-affinity antibodies from a large diverse library of antibody-encoding genes (Table 3).\n\nYeast Display.

Two peptides were further confirmed to inhibit both E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and CHIP, and their binding modes were solved by the NMR analysis. Zhao et al. made a phage panning scheme that separately covered selections against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and sulfated tyrosine (sTyr) peptides, followed by NGS.

            "text": "As mentioned above, different surface platforms, e.g., mammalian cell display, ribosome display, yeast display, and phage display, are used for screening recombinant antibody libraries and each has different advantages and disadvantages (48,89). The common method used in different platforms is the same for displaying the libraries and contains several rounds of screening for selecting specific antibodies (48). The main differences in platforms are related to the differences in the diversity of libraries, different efficiencies in screening, and the possibility of antibody maturation (48). In particular, yeast and mammalian displays can increase the affinity maturation of antibodies due to the ability of post-translational modifications in displayed fragments (48,89,125). Moreover, the main advantage of these platforms is their compatibility with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), leading to precise control over screening and selecting high-affinity antibodies, which bind specifically to the targeted antigen (125,126). However, multivalent binding has been reported as a significant drawback of yeast or mammalian cell platforms because of the presence of antibody density on their cell surfaces. This disadvantage allows for isolating antibodies with lower affinity compared to monovalent techniques, e.g., phage display (48). Additionally, the construction of large libraries is challenging in these platforms, as far as the number of unique antibody copies in the yeast or mammalian libraries is several orders of magnitude lower than in phage libraries, leading to the selection of few candidates in the panning process (89,127).\n\nThe phage, ribosome, and bacterial display libraries have been constructed with more than 10 11 clones, allowing for the generation and screening of a huge diversity of clones (48,86,128). Antibody expression in these systems, especially in phage display, is considered a straightforward process with many advantages (95, 96). Moreover, since gene manipulation in these platforms is easy, the generation of antibodies with higher affinity and specificity is more feasible than other recombinant technologies (49,129). Notably, over the past decades, phage display has been the most widely used system for the production of rAbs and was awarded 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Application of phage antibody libraries has been reported for identification of various targets, including haptens, and foreign",

While antibody generation itself is typically not considered a core developability activity, it certainly can affect the resulting range of molecular properties and therefore developability outcomes. 12,22 When performing developability assessments, it is important to consider the method of generation used, whether it is mouse immunization (followed by hybridoma screening), phage or yeast display technologies, or synthetic libraries. Different selection technologies may yield different outcomes in terms of antibody properties. For instance, phage display generation can increase the likelihood for developability issues such as reduced solubility, 23 increased hydrophobicity, 24,25 and increased non-specificity leading to poor half-life. 26 These outcomes may result from multiple rounds of phage selection, which are done to yield high affinity molecules but may also build up excessive charge or hydrophobicity in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), leading to worse developability outcomes. 26 Further, nonspecific binding is not as significant a selection pressure in phage display as it may be in animal immunization approaches, where in the latter, generated antibodies are deselected for autoimmunity. 26 To compensate for this lack of natural selection, hydrophobic CDRs may be manually deselected in the phage display screening process 27 or additional selection measures can be taken to screen out unfolded or unstable variable domains. 28 ikewise, yeast display affinity maturation typically increases hydrophobicity, aggregation rates, and selfinteraction propensity, 19 as binding is iteratively maximized like in phage display. However, a major advantage of using yeast display is the presence of the eukaryotic protein production machinery required to maintain post-translational modifications. 29 Further, strategies exist to select for increased thermal stability of yeast display variants. 30",

            "text": "This assessment was done via a sandwich ELISA approach that included immobilization of an anti-Fab antibody in the microtiter plates to capture phage particles followed by incubation with an anti-M13 antibody (HRP conjugated). Again, no difference was observed between pre-and post-packaging, with a very high number of displaying clones in both cases (average of 90% (range from 85% to 94%) displaying clones prepackaging vs. 93% (range from 89% to 97%) displaying clones postpackaging (Figure 3c)). \n\nThese are interesting observations since nonfunctional clones, where the molecule is not expressed, are thought to have a growth advantage over clones containing open-reading frames and expressing antibodies. However, as the two domains of the Fab molecules (VL-CL, VH-CH1) are expressed by two cistrons, loss of functionality in one chain will not prevent the other from being expressed, perhaps limiting potential growth advantages. \n\nFull-length Fab NGS using Pacbio Sequel II revealed no clonal dominance in the library, with the most frequently observed clone representing only ~0.001% of the reads in Lib4A. However, the true frequency is likely less, as we are vastly under-sampling the diversity and this clone had only two reads (Table 2). We also verified the identity of the CDRs in the final library compared to the design and for the presence of liabilities. On average, 94.1% of the CDRs observed in the library matched designed sequences (range from 90.1% to 98.1%) (Table 3). Although non-matching CDRs are expected due to oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR-derived errors, they are always far less abundant than the designed CDRs (Supplementary Figures S2-S6). Since some sequences diverge from design, it is inevitable that sequence liabilities are inadvertently reintroduced. Nonetheless, more than 97% of the naturally replicated CDRs in clones analyzed in all libraries had no sequence liabilities (Figure 4a). Finally, the NovaSeq S4 platform was used to analyze the HCDR3 diversity of the final cloned library.",

            "text": "The use of synthetic libraries allows displaying artificial unnatural scFvs by the replacement of genes encoding complementary determining regions in the V H with random oligonucleotides. These libraries are constructed from human as well as rodent genomes so that antibody phage displays can provide human and mouse antibodies. Similarly, random synthetic peptide libraries possess large structural diversity complementing these antibody approaches [39,40,319,320,365].\n\nThe real advantage of these libraries, however, is that they can be used for biopanning (reviewed in [366]), which is a method to screen phage libraries against immobilized antigen on plates or beads, cell-based screenings, tissue-based screenings and/or in vivo screenings. Using scFv phage libraries Edwards and colleagues identified a set of antibodies binding to the cell surface of human adipocytes [367]. Interestingly, however, none of the tested antibodies was selective to adipose tissue and cross-reacted with at least one additional tissue. In contrast with this in vitro biopanning, the use of in vivo biopanning has major advantages as it allows selecting for specific binding of a biomolecules to a target tissue, while in parallel negatively selecting against all other tissues and cell types in the body. Indeed, using this in vivo approach novel peptides targeting murine BAT [365], WAT [368], and the adipose tissue endothelium [40], APCs [39,319,320] as well as adipocytes [33] were developed. Furthermore, targeting the adipose vasculature allowed the delivery of functional peptides and liposome into the adipose intercellular space [40,[369][370][371][372][373], suggesting that the surfome of the endothelium could also be a promising target in adipose tissue. Importantly, in vivo biopanning is not limited to phages but can be also performed with other 'barcoded'/retrievable molecules such as aptamers [366].\n\nAptamers are randomly synthesized short (typically 40-100 nucleotides) single-stranded deoxy-or ribonucleic acids (ssDNA/ssRNA) that can fold into",

            "text": "The production of sdAbs is important for the detection and identification of potential candidate proteins for further drug studies [15,39]. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that sdAbs are highly amendable to a variety of modifications without losing their structural integrity; in addition, they are compatible with a variety of high-throughput screening platforms such as yeast [58], phage [27], bacteria [59], and ribosome displays [60,61]-with the phage display being the most established one because of its large storage capacity, simple operation, and the ability to be manipulated at the gene level. Meanwhile, besides the employment of phage libraries derived from immunized specimens, na\u00efve [15,62] and synthetic libraries [63][64][65] have been explored as additional, less time-consuming options. It needs to be emphasized that IgNARs have experienced iterative affinity maturation in immunized sharks upon immunization [18]; therefore, VNARs from immunized libraries generally have higher affinities and specificities than those from semi-synthetic libraries and na\u00efve libraries. \n\nCurrently, the most popular and broadest approach through which to isolate target antigens for shark VNAR is through phage display (Figure 4). Using this technology, the gene encoding the antibody binding domain is fused with the phage coat protein gene to display the antibody on the phage surface for the selection of antigen recognition binding proteins [66]. Existing phages are built from stock in two forms. First, after repeated immune processes, simple blood samples are collected from animals to enhance and extract RNA, and then the VNAR sequence is amplified from the cDNA generated from the total information [67]. Antibodies with strong specificity and high affinity for immune antigens can usually be obtained with this method. Second, natural or semi-synthetic phage display libraries are constructed based on the VNAR domain produced by natural animals, and these usually contain additional diversity in the CDR region [68][69][70][71].",

On the other hand, this problem is not found in libraries using naturally derived sequences, as any antibody sequences that could not be properly expressed would have been eliminated from the natural immune repertoire during positive selection. The presence of N-linked glycosylation sites on CDRs on the other hand, was also shown to affect functionality in mammalian-expressed IgG in this study. This is yet another artifact present in synthetic repertoires and has to be taken into consideration when using synthetic libraries for rapid antibody selection. \n\nFurthermore, the poor ability of synthetic scFv clones to be expressed as soluble antibody even after the removal of amber stop codons also limited their utility for rapid antibody isolation. Out of twelve unique scFv clones, five could be expressed as functional soluble scFv; and only three of these along with one other weakly binding scFv could be converted into functional recombinant full-length IgG. In contrast, all isolated clones from the Humanyx Fab library worked as soluble Fab and could be expressed as functional IgG upon conversion. The non-natural structure of scFv may have allowed for some synthetic scFv sequences to fold in a way that allowed specific binding when expressed on phage but not when expressed as soluble antibody. Whereas, the screening for specific monoclonal Fab was performed using soluble Fab, therefore improperly folded antibodies would have been automatically eliminated. Furthermore, natural antibodies from the Fab library, unlike synthetic antibodies, are already pre-selected for proper folding and binding activity due to positive selection in the immune system, thus are unlikely to fold improperly when expressed as Fab and possibly even if expressed as scFv. \n\nWe were able to isolate multiple pairs of antibodies from the Fab library that were capable of detecting our target antigens at low concentrations. In particular, we were able to identify two pairs of anti-Etox monoclonal antibodies (clone 21 vs clone 149 and clone 22 vs clone 149) that gave limits of detection close to that obtained by antibody pairs isolated by standard hybridoma technology, reported to be 1-2 ng/ml (el Idrissi and Ward, 1992).",

Whereas previously the immunoglobulin repertoires of selection outputs were analyzed by colony picking and Sanger sequencing, we can now employ Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) to analyze the outcome of in vitro selection outputs. [1][2][3][4] The former allowed the identification of the most dominant clones, but provided a small snapshot of the selection output and did not guarantee the discovery of the best candidates. The latter allows a much deeper inspection of candidate pools after the final round of panning, by retrieving up to 10 7 sequences. 1,5,6 The bigger depth of NGS analysis allows for the selection of a more diverse candidate dataset by providing alternatives to the dominant ''top clones\", which arise from careful inspection of patterns across conditions and controls. Additionally, NGS has also proven to be a useful tool for the quality control of antibody libraries, of both natural and synthetic origin, in terms of their CDR length distribution, germline frequencies and clone redundancy. [7][8][9] The number of CDRs diversified on a library will impact the NGS strategy employed. Although HCDR3 is widely recognized as the most important CDR for antigen binding, the interplay of all six CDRs is necessary for the antibody-antigen interaction. [10][11][12] Primary library strategies have increasingly relied on the randomization of other CDRs to discover antibodies against antigens. Ylanthia (randomized in LCDR3 and HCDR3) 9 and HuCAL PLATINUM \u00d2 (all six CDRs) 13 constitute clear examples of state-of-the-art synthetic libraries that employ such strategies.\n\nHowever, while all NGS platforms can sequence the HCDR3 in its entirety (%12-105 bp), most wo\u0144 t be able to capture the full CDR diversity of some libraries. This is especially true if diversity is simultaneously located on the separate variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) chains and will be exacerbated if a Fab library is used, due to the additional C L domain in",

            "text": "During panning of a phage-displayed antibody library, the selection outcome is determined not only by the binding affinity to the target antigen, but also in large part by the display level and/or growth rates of the clones. The diversity of the panning output may be reduced greatly as a result, because of the preferential enrichment of a small number of binders with significant display/growth advantage, or the faster amplification of some nonbinders or non-producers. Even within a synthetic antibody library that employs a fixed framework scaffold, wide variation in the amplification efficiency among the clones was observed, suggesting that CDR sequences have a significant influence on the enrichment of antibody clones during biopanning. \n\nA synthetic scFv library with pre-defined CDR sequences was designed and constructed previously (OPAL-S) [3]. It should be noted that although the reported size of OPAL-S was 8 \u00d7 10 8 , the library used in this study was expanded to 1.3 \u00d7 10 10 through additional transformations and is comparable in size to OPAL-T (1.4 \u00d7 10 10 , Table 1). Since the designed diversity of each CDR in this library was between 10 3 -10 4 , we were able to track the change in relative abundance of every predefined CDR sequence before and after biopanning against protein A by NGS. Non-H3 CDR sequences of OPAL-S were designed individually by simulating somatic hypermutations to the human germline CDR sequences, and thus they were traceable to their germline ancestors. From the analysis of panning enrichment patterns of the CDR sequences, with the exception of CDR-H2, the germline origin of CDR sequences appeared not to have marked influence on the amplification of scFv clones in the context of the VH3-23, V\u03ba3-20, and V\u03bb1-47 scaffolds.",

            "text": "Phage display has become an efficient, reliable and popular molecular technique for generating libraries encompassing millions or even billions of clones of divergent peptides or proteins. The method is based on the correspondence between phage genotype and phenotype, which ensures the presentation of recombinant proteins of known amino acid composition on the surface of phage particles. The use of affinity selection allows one to choose variants with affinity for different targets from phage libraries. The implementation of the antibody phage display technique has revolutionized the field of clinical immunology, both for developing tools to diagnose infectious diseases and for producing therapeutic agents. It has also become the basis for efficient and relatively inexpensive methods for studying protein\u2013protein interactions, receptor binding sites, as well as epitope and mimotope identification. The antibody phage display technique involves a number of steps, and the final result depends on their successful implementation. The diversity, whether natural or obtained by combinatorial chemistry, is the basis of any library. The choice of molecular techniques is critical to ensure that this diversity is maintained during the phage library preparation step and during the transformation of E. coli cells. After a helper phage is added to the suspension of transformed E. coli cells, a bacteriophage library is formed, which is a working tool for performing the affinity selection procedure and searching for individual molecules. Despite the apparent simplicity of generating phage antibody libraries, a number of subtleties need to be taken into account. First, there are the features of phage vector preparation. Currently, a large number of phagemid vectors have been developed, and their selection is also of great importance. The key step is preparing competent E. coli cells and the technology of their transformation. The choice of a helper phage and the method used to generate it is also important. This article discusses the key challenges faced by researchers in constructing phage antibody libraries",

            "text": "In addition, the phage display can simplify the cloning process and acquire a large amount of material to produce peptides or proteins because of the small size of the phage genome and high efficiency of the phage infection (67,68). \n\nThe phage display offers the direct physical link between a protein and its genetic material, which helps people to effectively screen the desired cloning again and again, and then amplify it (67). In the process of library screening, specific phage clones are enriched continuously due to their specific affinity for ligands, and relatively rare clones that can bind ligands can be quickly and effectively screened out from a large library (58). Therefore, the biggest advantage of phage display is that once the phage library is established, specific antibodies against the target antigen can be directly screened from the library according to the needs within 23 weeks, which greatly reduces the preparation cycle of mAbs (61). In addition, by specific construction, the filamentous phage may act as a vector, and generate a peptide library of phage display that contains hundreds of millions of unique peptides, which are conducive to their application in antiviral research (69). However, due to the different binding properties of antibodies in bacteria and eukaryotic cells, the applicability of the technology is limited to a certain extent (70). The processes of the phage display refer to bacterial transformation, phage packaging, and even transmembrane secretion processes, which limit the capacity of the phage display library and their molecular diversity. At present, the capacity of the phage display library is usually 10 11 (27). Also, limited by the expression system, the antibody library is not large enough to support the acquisition of some rare antibodies and not all sequences are well expressed in phages, because the realisation of some protein functions acquire folding, transportation, membrane insertion and complexation, resulting in the need for additional selection pressure during in vivo screening (45). It is difficult to obtain antibodies that inhibit the growth or function of phages or the expression host, as the phage display system depends on the expression of intracellular genes, which may make the diversity of the library decrease rapidly (71).",

            "text": "The identification of therapeutic peptides from unmodified phage-displayed libraries is hindered because linear peptides have poor pharmacokinetic properties. The introduction of ncAAs and motifs allows for a more simplistic transition of peptide lead compounds into therapeutics, as they can increase the stability and improve binding toward a desired target. In the past two decades, noncanonical peptides have been produced on phage-displayed libraries through two segregated techniques: genetic code expansion and chemical transformations. Both techniques have afforded highly diverse phage-displayed libraries, ranging from linear libraries containing noncanonical moieties for enhanced phage selections to display of cyclic peptide libraries for enhanced pharmacokinetics. To further diversify phage libraries, it may be worthwhile to combine the two fields. For example, introduction of ncAAs through genetic code expansion can give highly specific reactive handles to selectively label phage libraries and to produce specific cyclic peptide motifs that avoid the ambiguity of labeling natural residues with chemical reagents. This would afford highly diverse libraries that are selectively modified, increasing efficiencies of selections and peptide characterization. While integration of genetic code expansion with chemically modified phage libraries would result in diverse scaffolds for phage-displayed peptides, there are still limitations to consider with phage display. The first of these involves the limitation regarding initial transformation efficiency\ufffdplasmids must be transformed into cells, which usually limits the displayed libraries to 10 10 peptides. There has been a recent case that generated a library of 10 11 peptides by transformation of diverse peptide scaffolds, but this would be the upper limit for most laboratories. 189 One way that may get around this limitation would be the integration of phage-displayed peptides into in vivo evolution systems, such as phage-assisted continuous evolution, that simultaneously mutate and select for peptides with desired activities. 190 This would provide essentially unlimited peptides available for screening, as higher diversities are generated as the evolution continues. Additionally, genetic code expansion in phage display is limited to only orthogonal translation systems, as the endogenous translation is necessary for producing all the phage proteins. Because of this, incorporation of ncAAs at sense codons is difficult due to competition with the natural amino acids.",

            "text": "The proportion of sequences in an antibody library that makes functional molecules is an important aspect that remains poorly understood. Functionality, in this case, goes beyond assessing the percentage of antibodies with open reading frames, and includes key biophysical properties that enable an antibody to be used as a therapeutic molecule. 3,7,15,43 equences encoding molecules with developability issues, or that are improperly folded or displayed, reduce a library's functional diversity, however high the genetic open reading frame diversity may be. This affects selection outcomes and may result in antibodies that cannot be used for downstream development without further engineering. In contrast to using degenerate oligonucleotides, for this library we produced defined sequences by oligonucleotide array synthesis for HCDR1-2 and LCDR1-3 corresponding to individual CDRs found in our NGS dataset. This provides substantial advantages: 1) the inclusion of only naturally occurring CDR sequences ensures CDRs are derived from B-cell receptors able to provide tonic survival signals, 44 and are hence inherently well folded; 2) the avoidance of inadvertent use of aberrant sequences, encoding co-variance violations, that may occur in degenerate oligos; 3) the exclusion of sequence liabilities; and 4) a more uniform CDR diversity distribution in the library, as opposed to that found in natural diversity in which germline sequences heavily dominate the CDR1 and CDR2 repertoires. As synthesis of defined oligonucleotides in arrays is limited to less than 1 million, we sourced HCDR3s from human donor B-cells, reasoning that liabilities occurring only in HCDR3s (and not the remaining CDRs) would be less detrimental to overall antibody developability, and could be more easily eliminated if necessary. \n\nTo further optimize the oligo pool for sequences encoding CDRs able to express well within the context of our chosen scaffolds, we included a yeast display enrichment step. For each of the four therapeutic scaffolds we generated five libraries containing diversity in only one CDR at a time (single-CDR libraries). Yeast display vectors for each antibody scaffold, reformatted as scFv, were created (Figure 4(a-c)).",

            "text": "Here, we summarize five technical platforms that are related to the production of therapeutic antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, humanization, phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology (Fig. 3d). Phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology have proven to be reliable methods for the generation of human antibodies. As enormous storehouses of antibody encoding genes (> 10 10 ) with unknown properties, high quality (antibody diversity) phage antibody libraries are critical to the successful identification of therapeutic mAbs. In addition, an optimal selection from phage display libraries is dependent on target antigen quality, antigen immobilization, and tight control of binding and wash conditions. Furthermore, careful prescreening design of conditions can tailor the characteristics of antibodies discovered from biopanning, including conformation specificity, epitope specificity, internalization, neutralization, and interspecies cross-reactivity. Currently, there are nine fully human antibodies that were discovered from phage libraries approved for therapy, and dozens more phage-derived antibody therapeutics are in clinical trials, waiting to enter the market [149] (Table 5).\n\nIn order to improve the quality of antibody drugs, researchers have developed several transgenic animals, including fully human mice and second-generation human chimeric mouse. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provide more options for antibody drug development in global pharmaceutical factories. All the transgenic-derived mAbs approved for therapeutic use have come from from three companies: Abgenix (XenoMouse) [36], Medarex (HuMAbMouse) [35], and Regeneron (VelocImmune) [165]. Depending on the immunization protocol, high affinity human antibodies can be obtained through selection of the clones generated in the animals. This selection is mainly accomplished by hybridoma technology. Currently, there are 19 approved human mAbs that were discovered from these three transgenic animals (Table 5).\n\nOver the past decade, generation of mAbs from isolated single B cells has become an increasingly attractive approach. To date, no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs have been derived from this method; however, it possesses several major advantages, and ongoing challenges are currently being solved. The success of the method relies heavily on the antigen",

            "text": "The method consists of building a library (left panel) of peptide or protein variants-or in the case of antibodies, an antibody gene repertoire-and affinity selecting (right panel) specific antibody-phage fusions via affinity with the target of interest. An antibody library is commonly built in a phagemid vector as fusions to one of the phage coat proteins. The repertoire of antibody variants, for instance cloned in the scFv format, is used to transform E. coli via electroporation and is expressed together with the other viral components. The population of specific scFvs-phage particles is enriched via binding to the target of interest. Non-specific or not-well-folded scFvs are removed via washing steps. The specific scFv-phage fusions are then eluted using diverse elution methods. The eluted phage bearing specific scFv genes can be used to infect E. coli and thus amplify the population of specific antibodies via additional rounds of selections. Alternatively, the outcome of the selection is characterized in the screening phase. \n\nBecause the phage display selection process is performed in vitro, this new technology platform also enabled the isolation of therapeutic antibodies in a variety of settings. For instance, necitumumab, a human antibody to treat cancer, was obtained by competition with the chimeric antibody cetixumab using phage display [13]. Another example is Adalimumab, the first fully human antibody to reach the market and the bestselling drug worldwide. Adalimumab was discovered and optimized using phage display via guided selection with a murine antibody [14]. In fact, up until 2017, six fully human therapeutic antibodies [15] discovered and/or engineered via phage display were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and hundreds have made it to clinical trials [16]. \n\nInitially, the main goal of phage display antibody discovery campaigns was to select for specific and high affinity antibodies [17]. In the last decade however, it has been learned that in addition to the specificity and affinity, other properties account for the success of a therapeutic antibody in clinical trials.",

            "text": "Display technologies allowed screening of vast repertoires of variants and were applied as an alternative or complementary way for identification of leading pHresponsive variants of an antibody. Different types of the displayed libraries were reported: simple phage-displayed scFv libraries of pertuzumab variants with NNB-randomized CDRs [91]; yeast-displayed libraries of separately synthesized genes encoding anti-VISTA antibody variants with charged residues introduced into CDRs [13]; yeast-displayed libraries of histidine-doped light chain paired with anti-CEACAM-5 VH-only binder [33]. All the libraries allowed to select pH-responsive variants of the parental molecules. The libraries were subjected to positive and negative steps by incubation with the antigen at predetermined pH, then desired pools of variants were retrieved, amplified, and introduced as input for subsequent selection round [13,33,91]. \n\nThe rational design or selection of a displayed library was followed by screening. Typically, the binding of each variant to antigen was analyzed in a simple ELISA at two different pH, e.g., 5.8 and 7.4 [29,91]. A comparison of the signal obtained in the two pH values facilitated initial selection of promising hits. More detailed analyzes based on surface plasmon resonance or biolayer interferometry were done in parallel with ELISA [27,29]. Some authors also did cell-based assays at different pH at a very early stage of biotherapeutic development [13,32]. Then, selected leading variants were further engineered. Identified mutations promoting pH-responsive binding were combined, and their impact was re-evaluated in biophysical assays. An additive effect of combined mutations was reported by at least three independent groups [13,29,33].",

            "text": "Perspective have been successfully applied to screen antibody libraries. Although less popular than phage display technology, these methods present some advantages, such as the ability of yeast cells to express complex proteins that require post-translational modifications or the possibility to create larger libraries using cell-free methods that are not restricted by the bacterial transformation efficiency. 64 he process of in vitro affinity selection, whether it is based on phage or other display systems, commonly includes (I) the generation of genotypic diversity by constructing protein or peptide libraries that consist of millions or billions of different variants; (II) the display method that creates a physical link between the expressed protein variant and the gene coding for it; (III) the application of selective pressure to screen for target-specific binders, and, finally, (IV) the amplification of the selected variants. 9 \u221267 These systems provide immediately the genes and corresponding DNA sequences of the clones selected against the specific target. Simple subcloning can allow presenting modifications or adding functionalities, such as purification tags or fusions to enzymes or fluorescent proteins. 65 Moreover, also conventionally challenging targets, such as toxic or nonimmunogenic molecules, have been successfully used. 68,69 he screening process of phage-displayed libraries, commonly known as panning, includes introducing the phagedisplayed library to the target captured to a solid surface, washing to remove the unbound and nonspecifically bound phages, elution of the bound phages, and amplification of the eluted phages through bacterial infection (Figure 2A). Ideally, only one round of selection is required, but as nonspecific binding limits the enrichment in one selection round, in most cases, three to five iterative rounds of selection and amplification are performed to select individual binders. \n\nA variety of modifications in the panning protocol and details for improved selections have been described for the identification of high-affinity binders from phage-displayed libraries. Generally, the experiment can be designed to maximize either phage capture or affinity discrimination. While effective capture is best used for the first selection round, the conditions can be modified in the later rounds to produce better affinity discrimination. 5",

            "text": "Reformatting of these pH-sensitive vNAR scaffolds was accomplished by fusing them to a human IgG 1 Fc domain and expressing the fusion proteins in HEK293 cells. Since vNAR domains comprise a highly stable framework and a robustness towards a wide range of different pH values, salt conditions and temperatures, the authors propose that these pH-sensitive vNAR domains might serve as valuable affinity ligands for tailored chromatographic purification processes [27]. \n\nIn a more recent approach, K\u00f6nning et al. discovered that screening of the previously reported, histidineenriched semi-synthetic vNAR libraries against therapeutic antibodies almost exclusively yielded anti-idiotypic binders [96]. This is particularly interesting as no counter selections were employed and the identified binders solely interacted with the variable rather than the constants domains of the antibody target. Even more astonishing was the finding, that the reformatted anti-idiotypic vNAR-Fc fusion constructs comprised affinities in the nano-to picomolar range, although derived from semisynthetic and not immune libraries. This observation was unexpected considering that binders which were initially derived from such semi-synthetic libraries towards other antigens typically comprised bivalent affinities in the three-digit nanomolar to micromolar range [26,27,95]. \n\nOwing to their small size and increased stability in comparison to conventional antibodies and also scFv domains, vNAR domains represent an attractive protein scaffold that can easily be tailored towards function. It has been shown that this scaffold readily tolerates substitutions throughout its loop regions without compromising overall stability. The presence of a varying number of non-canonical disulfide bonds in these domains seems to predestine eukaryotic display systems for protein engineering. Yet, many approaches have clearly demonstrated the suitability of other display formats including phage and ribosomal display [97] for the screening of immune [98], na\u00efve [99] and synthetic [100] vNAR libraries. Nevertheless, the application of yeast surface display as stateof-the-art screening tool allows for the rapid selection of high-affinity vNAR antibody domains, appending this scaffold to the growing list of alternative binders that can be engineered and sampled using this technology.",

            "text": "The journey of generating antibodies through phage display technology commences with the construction of a diverse library. This process entails integrating genetic material encoding antibody fragments, such as antibodies' heavy and light chains, single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), Fabs, or peptides, into the genome of bacteriophages, notably filamentous ones like M13 [10]. This fusion results in the expression of a multitude of unique antibody candidates on the surface of phages, forming the basis of the library. The diversity of this library, ranging from millions to billions of variants, lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploration of potential binding partners (Figure 1) [11]. \n\nfoundation for the subsequent refinement and enhancement of phage display technology. The significant contributions of George P. Smith and Greg Winter culminated in the recognition of a half share of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work in developing phage display. \n\nUp to now, the impact of phage display in generating antibodies extends across diverse applications. In the field of therapeutics, it has played a pivotal role in the development of monoclonal antibodies for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions. Furthermore, phage display has significantly contributed to the discovery of antibodies targeting specific viral pathogens, such as influenza and HIV, providing valuable tools for both diagnosis and treatment [7,8]. Beyond therapeutics, phage display has been instrumental in antibody engineering, epitope mapping, and the study of protein interactions. Additionally, it has facilitated the identification of novel peptide ligands for drug targeting, the development of biosensors for disease detection, and the creation of protein libraries for enzyme optimization and protein-protein interaction studies [9]. Overall, phage display continues to revolutionize biotechnology and biomedical research by enabling the rapid and efficient generation of high-affinity antibodies and protein-based therapeutics for a wide range of applications.",

            "text": "that can be efficiently displayed is limited to 12 amino acids. 71 In a phagemid-based system, antibody-pIII fusion is encoded in a separate plasmid (designated phagemid) and coinfection with a helper phage is required to provide all proteins for phage proliferation. 66,72,73 As a result, each phage particle contains both wild type and antibody-fusion pIII proteins. A key advantage of this system is that monoclonal display can be achieved, which facilitates selection of high affinity clones by avoiding the avidity effect during panning. 63,66 Meanwhile, phage infectivity is maximally retained due to the presence of wild type pIII. One drawback of the system is that wild type pIII is more efficiently assembled in the phage particle, resulting in only a small percentage (<10%) of antibody-displaying phage particles in the population. 74 As . According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library. In a typical phagemid system, variable regions of light and heavy chains, either cloned from a natural immunoglobulin repertoire or designed and synthesized in vitro, are cloned into a phage display vector (phagemid), with one of the chains genetically fused to pIII of phage for display. The library pool is then transformed to E.Coli host cells. By infection with helper phage, which provides all the components for phage production, a phage library is generated. Taking solid-phase panning as an example, the phage library is incubated with immobilized antigen. After washing, nonspecific phages are removed and antigen-specific phages stay with the antigen. The bound phages are then dissociated from the antigen by diverse methods, e.g., low-Ph elution, enzymatic cleavage. Lastly, eluted phages are subjected to propagation in E.Coli host cells. After iterative rounds of panning, antigen-specific clones are enriched. Typically, output phages from middle and late rounds of panning are subjected to sequencing and binding characterization for obtaining both sequence diversity and high affinity, respectively.

            "text": "Many selection technologies can be used to retrieve antigen-specific Nbs after the development of Nb libraries. One of the most robust techniques is phage display, but researchers have also successfully employed yeast display and bacterial display methods [58,61]. Other systems such as ribosome display have been proposed, but this selection method remains technically demanding [55]. A recent technique known as NestLink has emerged, where Nb sequences are linked to barcoding peptides (flycodes) and mixed with antigens [59]. Nb-antigen complexes can then be purified through size exclusion chromatography and the barcode peptide is cleaved for identification through mass spectrometry [59]. This method also allows for the determination of binding efficiencies and may hold potential for future use in vivo [59]. Interestingly, to improve the phage display technique and increase its efficiency, Verheesen et al. developed a 'real-time' monitoring system. Here, screening for individual Nb clones that perform well can be completed in parallel with the selection procedure [51]. Andre provided an overview of in vivo phage display methodologies, highlighting them as a promising emerging approach for enhancing antibody targeting and improving the characteristics of drug delivery [62]. \n\nFigure 2 provides an overview of the nanobody production procedure. \n\nscaffold, Moutel et al. screened several hundred clones from immune and na\u00efve llama VHH libraries to eventually find a very soluble and stable Nb for the creation of a universal humanized Nb library, known as the NaLi-H1 library [57]. Following the selection of a framework sequence, the hypervariable regions are then randomized, and the DNA is synthesized via PCR [55]. The achieved diversity of previously developed synthetic Nb libraries is typically around 10 9 , allowing for control of the library contents; however, libraries with a higher designed diversity can introduce more opportunities to find highbinding affinity Nbs [57][58][59]. In addition to following natural occurrences, a synthetic library can also be employed to recognize specific antigens, based on already known epitopes, using selection methods discussed below [60].",

            "text": "Phage display antibody libraries are an important source of therapeutic and reagent antibodies. 1,2 The small size and good solubility of phage particles and the combinatorial nature of most antibody libraries allow as many as 10 11 -10 12 unique antibodies to be displayed and selected. In addition, the ability to tailor in vitro selection parameters for defined antibody properties and the high-throughput nature of phage display system make it a very powerful platform. 3 Phage display antibody libraries, and other in vitro antibody display methods such as ribosome and mRNA display, usually make use of antibody fragments such as antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) or singlechain variable fragments (scFvs) due to difficulties in bacterial expression, folding and display of full-length IgG molecules. scFv phage libraries in particular are common because of the simplicity of the display vector and higher expression levels of scFv in Escherichia coli (E. coli) compared with Fab. 4,5 Following in vitro selection, soluble scFv from single colonies of E. coli can rapidly be expressed in sufficient amounts for high-throughput screening (HTS), [6][7][8][9] which helps to reduce the number of scFv antibodies for further characterization. However, since the predominant antibody drug format is full-length IgG, this screening is surrogate in nature and has disadvantages, including the lack of consistency between the activity of different formats, inability to assay for properties that are dependent on bi-valent binding or Fc-mediated function of an antibody, and the tendency of scFv antibodies to aggregate, which leads to false positive or negative results. 9 In addition, endotoxin-sensitive, cell-based functional assays are not compatible with scFv expressed in bacteria. This is a major drawback since functional assays are typically the most valuable in determining the most relevant antibodies. Moreover, these assays also often require purification of scFv samples, which reduces the throughput of the screens.\n\nThrough HTS, scFvs are triaged and then converted to whole IgG on an individual basis to preserve pairing of the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains. This is timeconsuming, labor intensive and low throughput.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT Phage display antibody libraries are a rich resource for discovery of potential therapeutic antibodies. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries are the most common format due to the efficient display of scFv by phage particles and the ease by which soluble scFv antibodies can be expressed for high-throughput screening. Typically, a cascade of screening and triaging activities are performed, beginning with the assessment of large numbers of E. coli-expressed scFv, and progressing through additional assays with individual reformatting of the most promising scFv to full-length IgG. However, use of high-throughput screening of scFv for the discovery of full-length IgG is not ideal because of the differences between these molecules. Furthermore, the reformatting step represents a bottle neck in the process because each antibody has to be handled individually to preserve the unique VH and VL pairing. These problems could be resolved if populations of scFv could be reformatted to full-length IgG before screening without disrupting the variable region pairing. Here, we describe a novel strategy that allows the reformatting of diverse populations of scFv from phage selections to full-length IgG in a batch format. The reformatting process maintains the diversity and variable region pairing with high fidelity, and the resulted IgG pool enables high-throughput expression of IgG in mammalian cells and cell-based functional screening. The improved process led to the discovery of potent candidates that are comparable or better than those obtained by traditional methods. This strategy should also be readily applicable to Fab-based phage libraries. Our approach, Screening in Product Format (SiPF), represents a substantial improvement in the field of antibody discovery using phage display.",

            "text": "ABSTRACT We previously described an in vitro single-chain fragment (scFv) library platform originally designed to generate antibodies with excellent developability properties. The platform design was based on the use of clinical antibodies as scaffolds into which replicated natural complementarity-determining regions purged of sequence liabilities were inserted, and the use of phage and yeast display to carry out antibody selection. In addition to being developable, antibodies generated using our platform were extremely diverse, with most campaigns yielding sub-nanomolar binders. Here, we describe a platform advancement that incorporates Fab phage display followed by single-chain antibody-binding fragment Fab (scFab) yeast display. The scFab single-gene format provides balanced expression of light and heavy chains, with enhanced conversion to IgG, thereby combining the advantages of scFvs and Fabs. A meticulously engineered, quality-controlled Fab phage library was created using design principles similar to those used to create the scFv library. A diverse panel of binding scFabs, with high conversion efficiency to IgG, was isolated against two targets. This study highlights the compatibility of phage and yeast display with a Fab semi-synthetic library design, offering an efficient approach to generate drug-like antibodies directly, facilitating their conversion to potential therapeutic candidates.",

            "text": "The discovery of hybridoma technology, described by Kohler and Milstein in 1975, and the resulting ability to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) initiated a new era in antibody research and clinical development. However, limitations of the hybridoma technology as a routine antibody generation method in conjunction with high immunogenicity responses have led to the development of alternative approaches for the streamlined identification of most effective antibodies. Within this context, display selection technologies such as phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial display, and mammalian cell surface display have been widely promoted over the past three decades as ideal alternatives to traditional hybridoma methods. The display of antibodies on phages is probably the most widespread and powerful of these methods and, since its invention in late 1980s, significant technological advancements in the design, construction, and selection of antibody libraries have been made, and several fully human antibodies generated by phage display are currently approved or in various clinical development stages. With evolving novel disease targets and the emerging of a new generation of therapeutic antibodies, such as bispecific antibodies, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies, it is clear that phage display is expected to continue to play a central role in antibody development. Nevertheless, for non-standard and more demanding cases aiming to generate best-in-class therapeutic antibodies against challenging targets and unmet medical needs, in vivo phage display selections by which phage libraries are directly injected into animals or humans for isolating and identifying the phages bound to specific tissues offer an advantage over conventional in vitro phage display screening procedures. Thus, in the present review, we will first summarize a general overview of the antibody therapeutic market, the different types of antibody fragments, and novel engineered variants that have already been explored. Then, we will discuss the state-of-the-art of in vivo phage display methodologies as a promising emerging selection strategy for improvement antibody targeting and drug delivery properties.",

Both the source and the origin may affect the antibodies' developability profile. Natural antibodies, which are derived from natural, non-engineered sequences and typically sourced from (immunized) animals or patient populations, are to date the most commonly used source of antibodies. 7 Such antibodies inherently carry the benefit of having been derived from a living creature and have gone through affinity maturation and self-tolerance in vivo, which often results in a good developability profile. 7 However, in the context of clinical use, there is a stark difference between human and animal-derived antibodies. Whilst the former constitutes antibodies that have a low risk of immunogenicity, antibodies of non-human origin may elicit severe immune responses in patients, depending on the animal from which they were derived. The risk of immunogenicity can be reduced in several ways. For example, antibodies can be humanized or animals transgenic for human immunoglobulins (e.g., rabbits 10 or mice [11][12][13][14] ) can be used for immunization. A potential limitation of antibodies derived from immunization campaigns is that they will primarily target the most immunogenic epitopes of an antigen. This can limit epitope diversity and potentially prevent the discovery of binders to important, but low-or non-immunogenic antigen epitopes. Furthermore, inadequate immunization strategies can prevent antibodies from being discovered toward targets that are highly homologous to targets expressed within the immunized host due to self-tolerance. \n\nTo avoid these limitations, other types of antibodies have increased in popularity, i.e., synthetic antibodies, 15,16 as they allow the discovery of binders toward, in principle, any target. Such antibodies may originate from rationally designed recombinant antibody repertoires and are typically discovered via in vitro display technologies. 17 Using such methodologies grants substantial control over the antibody libraries.",

            "text": "Display of foreign peptide on the bacteriophage surface without affecting phage infection was first described by George P. Smith in 1985. 37 Since then, phage display technology has been extensively applied to various applications, e.g., protein evolution (also known as directed evolution), epitope determination, identification of enzyme substrates, and drug discovery. 38 Since phenotype and genotype are physically linked in a phage display system, protein variants with desired properties can be rapidly selected through panning and the genetic information can be readily extracted. In a phage display system, a library in which diversified peptide or protein variants are displayed on phage surface is constructed (typically 10 10 \u2212 10 12 diversity). Variants with favored properties are enriched during iterative selection cycles. Unique sequences can then be screened for further applications. While the success of phage display has been demonstrated in a wide variety of areas, this review will focus on its application in therapeutic antibody discovery.\n\nAntibody phage display was originally developed in three institutes: Institute of Cell and Tumor Biology at German Cancer Research Center (Germany), 39 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (United Kingdom), 40,41 and Scripps Research Institute (United States). 42,43 Since then, various antibody fragment formats have been commonly used for phage display, such as single chain variable fragment (scFv), 44,45 antigen binding fragment (Fab), 24,46 single-domain antibody (VHH), 47,48 and bispecific antibody fragment. [49][50][51] Although display of full-length IgG on phage was also reported, 52,53 this platform was not widely used, likely due to unstable display, low display level, and bias on phage propagation, which resulted in limited functional diversity of the library. However, strategies for functional screening in fulllength IgG format after phage panning have been reported, e.g., dual host vector, 54 donor-acceptor system, 55 highthroughput reformatting, and mammalian expression of phage-derived antibodies. 56,57 Nevertheless, the display of full-length antibody can be readily achieved by eukaryotic display platforms, such as yeast and mammalian cell display.

            "text": "We found that the majority of clones in the unselected library that contained both the heavy and light chain inserts were capable of expressing phage bearing Fab and that varying the selection conditions did not improve the genetic diversity of the antigen-specific clones isolated from our phage display library. In order to test whether repeated rounds of selection and amplification were responsible for the limited genetic diversity, we screened phage pools from earlier rounds of selection and sequenced the Vk and V H genes of the antigen-specific clones. While the percentage of antigen-specific clones in earlier phage pools was much lower than that of later pools, the V-gene diversity of such clones was very similar to that of antigen-specific clones in later rounds, suggesting that multiple rounds of selection and amplification may not be a major reason for lack of genetic diversity in our TT-specific phage clones. Even though the phage library should be enriched for TT-specific sequences, a more likely explanation for the observed limited genetic diversity may involve random pairing of Vk and V H genes, resulting in antibodies with diminished or no specificity against the target antigen. This is supported by previous reports in which construction of anti-TT libraries preserving cognate H and L chain pairing, resulted in a very diverse V-gene repertoire where a combinatorial library from the same donor was less diverse [18,33] and in scFv phage libraries where the isolated V gene repertoire from phage were substantially different from those obtained by high throughput sequencing of V genes obtained from antigen-specific cells [10]. \n\nThe V-gene repertoire of TT-specific clones isolated from our phage display library was limited to four Vk and 16 V H genes. The Vk diversity is quite limited relative to the hybridoma panel, while the V H is somewhat limited in total numbers, but half of the Vk (2/4) and V H (8/16) genes in the phage display panel were not found in the hybridoma panel. The total antigen-specific selected phage display clones contained multiple replicates/variants of some clones as well as clones that were isolated only once or a few times. This has been reported for previous phage display libraries, and suggests that isolation of low-frequency clones may require extensive screening [34].",

            "text": "Phage display technology is a common approach for discovery of therapeutic antibodies. Drug candidates are typically isolated in two steps: First, a pool of antibodies is enriched through consecutive rounds of selection on a target antigen, and then individual clones are characterized in a screening procedure. When whole cells are used as targets, as in phenotypic discovery, the output phage pool typically contains thousands of antibodies, binding, in theory, hundreds of different cell surface receptors. Clonal expansion throughout the phage display enrichment process is affected by multiple factors resulting in extremely complex output phage pools where a few antibodies are highly abundant and the majority is very rare. This is a huge challenge in the screening where only a fraction of the antibodies can be tested using a conventional binding analysis, identifying mainly the most abundant clones typically binding only one or a few targets. As the expected number of antibodies and specificities in the pool is much higher, complementing methods, to reach deeper into the pool, are required, called deep mining methods. In this study, four deep mining methods were evaluated: 1) isolation of rare sub-pools of specific antibodies through selection on recombinant proteins predicted to be expressed on the target cells, 2) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies of unknown specificities through depletion of the primary phage pool on recombinant proteins corresponding to receptors known to generate many binders, 3) isolation of a sub-pool enriched for antibodies through selection on cells blocked with antibodies dominating the primary phage pool, and 4) next-generation sequencing-based analysis of isolated antibody pools followed by antibody gene synthesis and production of rare but enriched clones. We demonstrate that antibodies binding new targets and epitopes, not discovered through screening alone, can be discovered using described deep mining methods. Overall, we demonstrate the complexity of phage pools generated through selection on cells and show that a combination of conventional screening and deep mining methods are needed to fully utilize such pools. Deep mining will be important in future phenotypic antibody drug discovery efforts to increase the diversity of identified antibodies and targets.",

            "text": "Immunization strategies have long been employed to generate high-affinity antibodies, using previously expressed and purified antigens to establish immune reactions in animals (typically laboratory mice, humanized/transgenic mice, or other animals like chickens, rabbits, or cows). Antibody binding to specific antigens can be obtained through techniques such as hybridoma (Koehler and Milstein, 1975), single B cells (Yu et al., 2008), or screening natural and/or synthetic antibody libraries via display technologies using phage or yeast (Benatuil et al., 2010;Chen and Sidhu, 2014;Alfaleh et al., 2020;Gray A. et al., 2020;Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021;Ledsgaard et al., 2022;Valldorf et al., 2022). Promising candidates are selected and validated using antigenbinding assays that align with the research target profile. Currently used methods in the biopharmaceutical industry for antibody generation are almost exclusively experimental, and depending on the techniques used, it can take several months before an initial set of antibody-based binders is available for further investigation and lead identification. Fully synthetic human antibody libraries containing Fabs chosen for their biophysically favorable development characteristics have been developed using experimental means (Valldorf et al., 2022). Special emphasis has been placed on selecting molecules with enhanced chemical, conformational, and colloidal stabilities (Tiller et al., 2013). The availability of such libraries can significantly help accelerate the discovery of antibody-based biotherapeutics by pre-paying for developability. The concept of optimized antibody libraries for generating developable antibodies can be integrated with de novo computational databases containing an immense variety of human-like light-and heavy-chain combinations (Pan and Kortemme, 2021;Akbar et al., 2022). Targeted mutations at specific sequence positions [e.g., complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)] in the antibody sequences could further broaden the library, either to recognize different antigens or to optimize binding affinity toward a specific antigen (Ledsgaard et al., 2022).",

Moreover, the statistical and technical considerations that allow to deduce optimal screening strategies are discussed. The consideration of several factors such as the selection of the technique to introduce the diversity and the methods of amplification of the library is mandatory to obtain reliable libraries with an optimal diversity.

            "text": "This is most likely a reflection of the carefully designed semisynthetic nature of these libraries that have also been optimized for diversity and downstream developability [48,265]. For one of these examples, yeast display was implemented in a few more rounds of selection to identify ultrapotent (IC50 < 2 ng/ml) human neutralizing antibodies [264]. In addition, these examples also underscore the importance of how very potent antibodies can be discovered against a newly emerging viral pathogen because only the antigen sequence was required rather than a reliance on donor or patient materials for the original immune source (e.g. B cells after immunization or recovery). In fact, one of the antibodies identified from a human na\u00efve phage display library in one of the above examples, STE90-C11 or COR-101, was progressed into a Phase 1b/Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04674566). This exemplifies the expediency of phage display to generate potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizers versus isolating antibodies from convalescing patients or immunization of animals. \n\nAnother challenge was the identification of candidates that retained binding to SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa, and Delta; however, when the virus mutated further to generate more variants of interest/concern, such as Omicron, the neutralization efficiency of these mAbs was reduced. This necessitated the engineering of existing neutralizing mAbs that can be used as therapeutic candidates where optimization has increased affinity, potency, and reduced viral escape pathways by broadening the neutralization capacity across the increasing range of viral variants [266][267][268]. Other strategies to combat viral escape include targeting more conserved regions where there is less mutational load [269], the use of mAb cocktails or bispecifics covering several epitopes [270,271]. In fact, phage display-based affinity maturation could be applied to developing mAbs for the treatment of many different viral infections to reduce viral escape pathways as well as appropriate affinity maturation in vaccine immunization to aid resistance to viral variation [267].",

These immortalized cells are culturable and able to secrete antigen-specific antibodies. The scientists' invention, revolutionary for the production of monoclonal antibodies, was awarded with a Nobel Prize in 1984. \nIt became apparent, however, that the hybridoma technology is a lengthy process with low efficiency. In addition, the murine origin of the antibodies causes a potential problem with immunogenicity when applied to humans. \nSeveral new technologies have been developed in the last decades in order to overcome these limitations. These technologies include the use of human naive, semi-synthetic or synthetic antibody diversities (to avoid the immunogenicity issue) in combination with cellular or non-cellular in vitro selection systems for the presentation and isolation of antibodies, such as Phage or Yeast Display. By the invention of these methods, large repertoires could be examined for predefined characteristics, thus enabling the isolation of specific molecules, which advanced today's successful use of monoclonal antibodies in biotechnological and medical applications. Despite all improvements in the finding process of antibodies, the generation of initial display libraries is still complex and laborious. It is often a multistage process which, as with Yeast Display, encompasses multiple cloning steps, the generation of separated libraries for heavy and light chains as well as, ultimately, their mating. This process can be simplified and condensed to only one reaction through the application of Golden Gate Cloning (GGC). The cloning reaction within GGC is based on the use of Type IIs restriction enzymes, which digest DNA in a defined distance from their recognition sequences and, thereby, allow for the incorporation of overhangs with requested signatures. Type IIs restriction enzymes enable a targeted, single-stage cloning process in which all recognition sequences are removed during the reaction, thereby causing an equilibrium shift towards the specific cloning product. \nAs part of this work, the feasibility of GGC for the generation of Yeast and Phage Display libraries could be demonstrated for three different selection campaigns. Specific Fab antibodies against CEACAM6, EGFR and hCG were isolated from the immune repertoires of transgenic rats and wild type chickens (Yeast Display), and EGFR-specific scFv and VHH antibodies were isolated from the immune repertoires of chickens and camelids (Phage Display). In comparison to the traditional generation of antibody libraries, GGC could be validated with regards to gene repertoire distribution, the overall size of libraries as well as to the biophysical characteristics of isolated antibodies. The developed single-stage GGC process is able to generate antibody libraries based on combinatorial heavy and light chain diversities with the same quality as the traditional method. In addition, the process is a faster and less laborious method, which parallels the multiple steps of the original approach. \nBesides classical monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments, new antibody formats can broaden the therapeutic space of new biological entities. Among these are molecules such as bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) and immunoligands, as wells as other antibody fragments and derivates - such as camelid single domain antibody Fc-fusions. \nIn theory, four different plasmids have to be used during the expression of IgG-based bispecific antibodies in cell culture, as they consist of two different heavy chains and two different light chains. This would lead to a statistical yield of only 12.5 % of the desired assembled protein. The Strand Exchange Engineered Domain (SEED) technology is one possibility to avoid heterogeneity during the expression of several similar polypeptide chains. Through the introduction of alternating IgA and IgG \u03b2 sheet structures in the CH3 domains, antiparallel immunoglobulin structures occur, which promote a heterodimerization of the heavy chains. In order to avoid heavy chain homodimerization, additional technologies, such as \"knob-into-holes\", controlled Fab arm exchange or targeted amino acid exchanges used to introduce contrary electrostatic charges into both heavy chains have been developed. \nMoreover, mispairing of antibodies light chains can be prevented by technologies such as CrossMab or the use of a Common Light Chain. Another possibility is the utilization of camelid VHH domains. VHHs, compared to canonical antibodies, provide specific antigen binding exclusively via the variable domain of the heavy chain. \nIn this context, it was one of the goals of the present work to combine the SEED Technology with a bispecific Fab-like VHH antibody which was conceptionally described by Baty and coworkers in 2013. This combination enabled the generation of a novel bi- and trispecific, IgG-like VHH-based antibody platform with related variable valences. \nThe results of the characterization of this antibody format with regards to its biophysical and biochemical characteristics - such as the specific NK cell-mediated ADCC - verify the versatility of the generic platform in expressing fully functional mono-, bi- and trispecific antibodies with different valences as a \"plug and play\" application. \nFurthermore, the use of bispecific molecules for a targeted NK cell recruitment is of substantial interest nowadays. The specific NK cell recruitment towards tumorous or infected cells enables a specific cytolysis of target cells and a simultaneous immune modulation through NK cell-mediated cytokine release. \nOne possibility to address the recruitment of NK cells are the Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors (NCRs), comprehensively expressed by NK cells. For this work, and through the use of Yeast Display, the N-terminal IgV-like domain of B7 H6 (natural ligand of NKp30), which is relevant for receptor binding, could be affinity matured. Via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-based selection, B7 H6 variants with significantly increased affinity to NKp30 were achieved. Additionally, these variants showed significantly increased NK cell mediated cytotoxicities and cytokine release when used in the format of bispecific immunoligands, compared to the parental B7-H6 molecule. \nThese results verify the underlying hypothesis that an increased affinity of B7 H6 to NKp30 results in an increased NK cell-based tumor cell cytolysis as well as in increased NK cell-mediated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. An increased affinity of activating NK cell receptors natural ligands could, therefore, be used in the development of potential immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with various cancerous diseases.",

The current state of peptide therapeutics is discussed, including their merits and challenges, as well as recent technological developments that have enabled a new era in peptide research and development. The technology behind PeptiDream\u2019s Peptide Discovery Platform System (PDPS) is described, showing how it can be used to rapidly generate libraries of constrained peptides and obtain detailed SAR information. This technology can provide, with a high rate of success, potent peptide ligands that may be developed as drug candidates themselves, utilized in peptide\u2500 drug conjugates (PDC), or converted into small molecule drug leads. The outlook for the eld of constrained peptides and their use in the clinic is also described. Figure 2. Representative PPI inhibitors. Vol.75 No.11 2017 ( 85 ) 1171 onstrated that protein structural data and fragment based drug discovery techniques (FBDD) could be combined to create a drug that interferes with protein\u2500 protein interactions (PPI). 4 With a molecular weight of 868 Daltons, this compound stretches the boundaries of what can be called a small molecule, however the resulting drug can be administered orally. The next most anticipated classes of small molecule PPI inhibitors are antagonists of the MDM2/p53 and XIAP/Caspase\u2500 9 interactions, which have also been pursued for decades, and several of which are now in clinical trials. Within the well\u2500 established eld of antibodies, substantial effort is being made in the utilization of smaller antibody epitopes and fragments, intrabodies, nanobodies, monobodies, af bodies, etc. as the minimal key binding elements of full antibodies. 5 In addition, most major biopharmaceutical companies are currently active in antibody\u2500 drug conjugate (ADC) research and development, particularly in the eld of oncology, and various new hybrids of small and large molecules are being actively examined that defy traditional categorization of molecular size. 6 Much of the motivation for this push into new molecular modalities is due to the untapped pool of potential PPI drug targets, an interest likely to continue given the current intense industry focus on immuno\u2500 oncology, for which a wealth of PPI drug targets are anticipated. It is hoped that a new generation of medium\u2500 sized molecules could be used to address some challenging drug targets traditionally considered only for antibodies, while retaining many of the desirable properties of smaller molecules. 1.2 The State of Traditional Peptide Drugs To address the growing need for medium\u2500 sized molecules that can interfere with biologically relevant PPI targets, peptides provide an ideal platform; indeed, they are the molecules used by nature in regulating the cellular machinery. 7 They can be readily synthesized under standard conditions that allow for the incorporation of various amino acid building blocks to provide large, well\u2500 de ned molecules of variable sizes and reasonable physicochemical properties. However, the modern development of peptides as medicines has been hampered due to PK/ADME limitations, as well as dif culties in synthesis and manufacturing. To date, a number of peptide molecules have been approved for clinical use in a variety of therapeutic areas, 8 including metabolic disease, antibacterial, antifungal, immunology, oncology, and endocrinology, and a representative sample of these are shown in Figure 3. Insulin, approaching 100 years of clinical use, remains the most important historic example, and even now research and development efforts are ongoing into various new ways of administering insulin besides frequent subcutaneous injection. More modestly sized 8\u2500 to 14\u2500 amino acid peptides such as cyclosporin A, leuprorelin, octreotide, and daptomycin have been developed since the 1980\u2019s, with cyclosporin A notable as being an orally administered drug. Its oral bioavailability is attributed to its stabilizing, yet exible, macrocyclic structure reinforced with several N \u2500 methylated amide bonds. 9 Currently, a wide variety of peptide drugs are being tested in the clinic, with an intense competition emerging over the past several years related to the development of GLP\u2500 1 receptor agonists, and exenatide representing the rst of several GLP\u2500 1 analogues approved for clinical use by the FDA in 2005. Despite the existence of these examples, the pace of peptide drug discovery and development has not come close to that for either small molecule drugs or antibodies. Each of these drug classes possesses distinct characteristics that affect their general utility as drugs, which are summarized in Table 1. Small molecules have the longest history in drug discovery, since they are relatively easy to synthesize, optimize, and administer. This comes with the trade\u2500 off that they frequently possess off\u2500 target biological activity that may translate into unexpected biological effects and toxicity during clinical development. Antibodies, on the other hand, are generated to be highly selective toward their desired target from the start, however, are limited to extracellular targets. 10 Antibodies are also more complicated and expensive to manufacture, and can only be administered by injection. In recent years, antibodies Figure 3. Representative peptide drugs approved for clinical use (year of FDA approval in parentheses): a) linear, b) macrocyclic. ( 86 ) J. Synth. Org. Chem., Jpn. 1172 have established a dominant position among the world\u2019s most effective and pro table drugs, however with the establishment of regulatory pathways toward the approval of biosimilars and an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment, the prolonged pro tability previously enjoyed by antibody drugs is expected to undergo major changes. Traditional peptide drug discovery has centered on the generation of analogues to natural peptides or protein fragments, with candidate molecules being prepared by laborious step\u2500 wise synthesis for smaller peptides or fermentation/isolation techniques for larger peptides. The peptides derived from these efforts can possess many of the high activity and potency features of antibodies, but also possess many of their issues in terms of manufacturing and administration routes. 1.3 Advances in Peptide Technology The eld of peptide synthesis experienced some major technical advances in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s that have enabled the stepwise progress seen in peptide drug development to date. The development of solid\u2500 phase synthesis techniques using Fmoc\u2500 protected amino acids and standardized coupling conditions, combined with the development of automated peptide synthesis instruments, have made the synthesis of long peptides routine (although not without challenges). 11 Peptides on the order of 60 amino acids are routinely prepared on a small scale, while the joining of over 100 amino acids is also possible but more challenging. While the chemistry involved is conceptually simple, real\u2500 world challenges in puri cation and yield become increasingly complicated with peptide length. In addition, cross\u2500 linked peptide chains provide more challenging synthetic targets. In addition to the brute force chemical approach to synthesis, phage display techniques have also come into common use since the 1990\u2019s, by which individual peptides and even libraries of peptides can by expressed on a large scale. 12 However, phage display has its limitations. It is primarily limited to incorporation of the 20 or so proteinogenic amino acids, and it remains dif cult to functionalize and control the three\u2500 dimensional structures of the proteins thus expressed. Thus, the diversity of peptide libraries that can be obtained through phage display is somewhat limited. 2. DNA\u2500 based Synthesis of Constrained Peptides To address some of the weaknesses of previous peptide synthesis approaches, the research group of Prof. Hiroaki Suga sought to create a new type of system that would allow for the display of constrained polypeptide libraries based on virtually any combination of natural and non\u2500 natural amino acids. The initial key discovery around 2003 was the development of Flexizymes, a class of engineered ribozymes that enable the charging of tRNA with almost any natural or non\u2500 natural amino acid. 13 This exibility with respect to substrate stands in contrast to the naturally occurring aminoacyl\u2500 tRNA synthetases (ARSs), which are highly speci c for their amino acid substrates. This RNA catalyst and substrate system drastically expanded the structural diversity of non\u2500 natural acyl\u2500 tRNAs, enabling the generation of a wide variety of constrained peptide libraries based on a translation system and corresponding DNA sequences. The company PeptiDream Inc. was founded in 2006 to commercialize this technology and library system for use in drug discovery. The combination of an acyl\u2500 tRNA library with genetic code reprogramming allows for the synthesis of peptides with structures and compositions well beyond those found in nature. 14 As shown in Figure 4, the removal of a given amino acid and its cognate ARS from the canonical codon table allow it to be replaced with a non\u2500 natural replacement (Naa1, Naa2, etc.). To date, we have used a wide variety of non\u2500 natural amino acids in such systems, such as those containing non\u2500 natural sidechains, D\u2500 amino acids, N \u2500 methylated amino acids, those containing reactive cross\u2500 linking groups, and peptoids. This has enabled the synthesis of a wide variety of large, highly diverse peptide libraries. While this technology can be used in the preparation of linear, stapled, and macrocyclic peptide libraries, we focus on macrocyclic peptides in this paper as they have provided some of the most signi cant results and thus have received the most focus to date. To utilize this technology, we have d",

The development of solid\u2500 phase synthesis techniques using Fmoc\u2500 protected amino acids and standardized coupling conditions, combined with the development of automated peptide synthesis instruments, have made the synthesis of long peptides routine (although not without challenges). 11 Peptides on the order of 60 amino acids are routinely prepared on a small scale, while the joining of over 100 amino acids is also possible but more challenging. While the chemistry involved is conceptually simple, real\u2500 world challenges in puri cation and yield become increasingly complicated with peptide length. In addition, cross\u2500 linked peptide chains provide more challenging synthetic targets. In addition to the brute force chemical approach to synthesis, phage display techniques have also come into common use since the 1990\u2019s, by which individual peptides and even libraries of peptides can by expressed on a large scale. 12 However, phage display has its limitations. It is primarily limited to incorporation of the 20 or so proteinogenic amino acids, and it remains dif cult to functionalize and control the three\u2500 dimensional structures of the proteins thus expressed. Thus, the diversity of peptide libraries that can be obtained through phage display is somewhat limited. 2. DNA\u2500 based Synthesis of Constrained Peptides To address some of the weaknesses of previous peptide synthesis approaches, the research group of Prof. Hiroaki Suga sought to create a new type of system that would allow for the display of constrained polypeptide libraries based on virtually any combination of natural and non\u2500 natural amino acids. The initial key discovery around 2003 was the development of Flexizymes, a class of engineered ribozymes that enable the charging of tRNA with almost any natural or non\u2500 natural amino acid. 13 This exibility with respect to substrate stands in contrast to the naturally occurring aminoacyl\u2500 tRNA synthetases (ARSs), which are highly speci c for their amino acid substrates. This RNA catalyst and substrate system drastically expanded the structural diversity of non\u2500 natural acyl\u2500 tRNAs, enabling the generation of a wide variety of constrained peptide libraries based on a translation system and corresponding DNA sequences. The company PeptiDream Inc. was founded in 2006 to commercialize this technology and library system for use in drug discovery. The combination of an acyl\u2500 tRNA library with genetic code reprogramming allows for the synthesis of peptides with structures and compositions well beyond those found in nature. 14 As shown in Figure 4, the removal of a given amino acid and its cognate ARS from the canonical codon table allow it to be replaced with a non\u2500 natural replacement (Naa1, Naa2, etc.). To date, we have used a wide variety of non\u2500 natural amino acids in such systems, such as those containing non\u2500 natural sidechains, D\u2500 amino acids, N \u2500 methylated amino acids, those containing reactive cross\u2500 linking groups, and peptoids. This has enabled the synthesis of a wide variety of large, highly diverse peptide libraries. While this technology can be used in the preparation of linear, stapled, and macrocyclic peptide libraries, we focus on macrocyclic peptides in this paper as they have provided some of the most signi cant results and thus have received the most focus to date. To utilize this technology, we have d",

            "abstract": "Natural products (NPs) are commonly defined as the secondary metabolites derived from plants, microorganisms, fungi, insects, and marine invertebrates, as the result of adaptation to the environment or as defense mechanisms against predators. Throughout history, the use of NPs has been described in the form of traditional medicines in different cultures for the treatment of ailments. Apart from their role in medicinal applications, the structures of NPs can also act as lead molecules to inspire the design of new drugs. Of the 1562 new approved drugs by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1981\u20132014, 791 (51%) were NPs, NP derivatives or NP-inspired drugs. Since the development of SCUBA in the mid-twentieth century, the marine environment, which contains an incredible diversity of organisms, has been described as the most desired source of NPs for drug discovery research. To date, approximately 35,147 marine natural products (MNPs) had been identified from various organisms, such as marine invertebrates (e.g. sponges, crinoids and ascidians), microorganisms and algae. Many of these MNPs have been found to exhibit a wide variety of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities, such as anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities. There are currently 12 marine-derived compounds that have been approved as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer, viral infections, hypertriglyceridemia, and analgesia; while 27 drug candidates are currently in phase I, II, or III clinical trials. While numerous marine invertebrates have been well explored for bioactive MNPs in the last seven decades, crinoids belong to the phylum Echinodermata remained under investigated for their chemistry. Crinoids are the most primitive group of presentday echinoderms. They are known to produce diverse polyketide-derived pigments, which are not only responsible for their colourful appearance, but also have demonstrated significant activity in a range of biomedical assays. There are approximately 700 crinoid species that have been identified worldwide, however, only 36 species have been chemically investigated and only 91 new compounds have been reported to date. Owing to our continuing research interest on crinoid chemistry, the main aim of this PhD project was to identify new chemistry from crinoids sourced from Australian waters and subsequently screen the isolated compounds in a variety of biological assays. The first crinoid project of this thesis focused on the chemistry of the feather star Capillaster multiradiatus since no studies had been undertaken on this Australian species. Capillasterin A, a novel pyrano[2,3-f]chromene, together with seven known naphthopyrones including comaparvin, TMC-256C1, 6-methoxycomaparvin 5-methyl ether, 5,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-2-propyl-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-4-one, 5,8- dihydroxy-6,10-dimethoxy-2-propyl-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-4-one, TMC-256A1 and 6-methoxycomaparvin were isolated from an EtOH/H2O extract of C. multiradiatus collected by collaborators from the Queensland Museum. The structures of all the compounds were determined by detailed spectroscopic (1D/2D NMR and MS) data analysis. As previous studies demonstrated that HIV gene expression is dependent on the host transcription factor complex NF-\uf06bB and naphthopyrones were reported to inhibit NF-\uf06bB signalling pathway, the six known naphthopyrones isolated from this crinoid, together with capillasterin A were screened in an anti-HIV assay. Five known naphthopyrones were observed to display moderate inhibition of in vitro HIV-1 replication in a T cell line with EC50 values ranging from 7.5 to 25.5 \u03bcM without concomitant cytotoxicity. The three most abundant compounds, capillasterin A, 6- methoxycomaparvin 5-methyl ether, and TMC-256A1 were also tested for their ability to stimulate the proliferation of GFP-expressing immortalised mouse olfactory ensheathing cells (mOEC) using a cell proliferation assay; none of the compounds showed a significant increase in mOEC viability at 10 \u03bcM after 24 hours of treatment. The AIMS Bioresources Library, which consisted of over 3000 marine samples, has recently been transferred to the NatureBank biota repository, which presented us with the opportunity to explore several new crinoid samples from a chemical perspective. Hence, the second PhD project, two AIMS-derived Australian crinoid Comatula rotalaria specimens collected from different locations on the Great Barrier Reef were selected for potential new chemistry, since preliminary UHPLC analysis of these crinoid extracts suggested the presence of new anthraquinone chemistry; only four acyl derivatives of anthraquinones had been identified from this species prior to our studies. Five new taurine-conjugated anthraquinones, named comatulins A\u2212E, together with 11 known metabolites, rhodocomatulin 7-methyl ether, 12-desethylrhodocomatulin 7-methyl ether, rhodocomatulin 5,7-dimethyl ether, 12-desethylrhodocomatulin 5,7-dimethyl ether, rhodocomatulin, rhodolamprometrin, 6-methoxyrhodocomatulin 7-methyl ether, rheoemodin, 6-methoxycomaparvin, 6-methoxycomaparvin 5-methyl ether, and 5,8- dihydroxy-6,10-dimethoxy-2-methyl-4H-benzo[h]chromen-4-one were identified. The structures of all the compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic and spectrometric data analysis. The first X-ray crystal structure of a crinoid-derived acyl anthraquinone, rhodocomatulin 5,7-dimethyl ether, was also obtained. Ten compounds together with two additional naphthopyrone derivatives (comaparvin and 6- methoxycomaparvin 5,8-dimethyl ether) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro; none of the compounds were active at 100 \u03bcM. Furthermore, a subset of compounds was tested for their nematocidal activity against Haemonchus contortus, which is a highly pathogenic parasite of small ruminants. The semi-synthetic compound, 6-methoxycomaparvin 5,8-dimethyl ether, showed an inhibitory effect on larval motility (IC50 = 30 \u03bcM) and development (IC50 = 31 \u03bcM) and induced the eviscerated (Evi) phenotype. In Chapter 4, since none of the crinoid-derived polyketides identified during this PhD had been evaluated for their ability to increase phagocytic activity of human OECs (hOEC), six naphthopyrones and eight anthraquinones were screened using an hOEC phagocytosis assay that has recently been developed by the Clem Jones Centre for Neurobiology and Stem Cell Research group. In addition, microthecaline A and its acetylated, methylated and pivaloylated derivatives, together with antimalarial drug amodiaquine obtained from the in-house Davis compound library, were incorporated into the screening. Results from the primary screening demonstrated that four compounds including 6-methoxycomaparvin 5-methyl ether, 5,8-dihydroxy-6,10-dimethoxy-2- methyl-4H-benzo[h]chromen-4-one, comatulin A, and amodiaquine were found to significantly increase the phagocytic activity and the phagocytic efficiency of hOECs. These findings warrant further investigations in the near future to further expand the preliminary biology results and gain insights in compound specificity and potency. Encouraged by our findings in Chapter 3, we developed a dereplication method using UHPLC-MS for the identification of new sulphur-containing metabolites from Australian crinoids, the details of which are described in Chapter 5. The n-BuOH soluble material of 16 crinoids, including the two C. rotalaria samples described in Chapter 3, were subjected to UHPLC-MS profiling using an optimised method. These crinoids were all sourced from Griffith University\u2019s NatureBank biota repository. The generated UHPLC-MS data were analysed based on the characteristic fragment ions of sulphated compounds in conjunction with scientific database mining; SciFinder Scholar and MarinLit databases were used in this particular study. These investigations led to the large-scale extraction and isolation work on the prioritised crinoid Dichrometra flagellata, which resulted in the isolation of a previously undescribed sulphated compound, which we have tentatively assigned as 5,10-dihydroxy-6\u2013methoxy-8- sulphate-2-propyl-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-4-one. In summary, this thesis describes the isolation of seven new polyketide constituents and 17 known compounds from four crinoids collected from Australian waters. The chemical structures of all compounds were determined by detailed spectroscopic and spectrometric data analysis. Among all the tested crinoid metabolites, comaparvin was the most active compound in an anti-HIV replication assay, with an IC50 of 7.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcM; 6-methoxycomaparvin 5,8-dimethyl ether displayed an inhibitory effect on larval motility (IC50 = 30 \u03bcM) and development (IC50 = 31 \u03bcM), and induced the Evi phenotype in an anthelmintic assay; 6-methoxycomaparvin 5-methyl ether, 5,8- dihydroxy-6,10-dimethoxy-2-methyl-4H-benzo[h]chromen-4-one, and comatulin A significantly increased the phagocytic activity and the phagocytic efficiency of hOECs. All compounds isolated during this PhD project will be deposited into the Davis Open- Access Compound Library, which is located at Compounds Australia, Griffith University. Compounds Australia makes this academic library available for biological evaluations by both local and international researchers. In addition, the UHPLC-MS methodology developed during these studies enabled the rapid identification of new sulphur-containing compounds from n-BuOH soluble material derived from 16 crinoids, which resulted in the isolation of a new sulphated compound from the prioritised crinoid Dichrometra flagellata; this is the first report of NP chemistry from this crinoid genus. These findings further highlight the importance of UHPLC-MS as a dereplication tool in NP research.",

From naive antibody gene libraries - in theory - antibodies against any target can be selected. Here we describe the design, construction and characterization of an optimized antibody phage display library.ResultsThe naive antibody gene libraries HAL9 and HAL10, with a combined theoretical diversity of 1.5\u00d71010 independent clones, were constructed from 98 healthy donors using improved phage display vectors. In detail, most common phagemids employed for antibody phage display are using a combined His/Myc tag for detection and purification. We show that changing the tag order to Myc/His improved the production of soluble antibodies, but did not affect antibody phage display. For several published antibody libraries, the selected number of kappa scFvs were lower compared to lambda scFvs, probably due to a lower kappa scFv or Fab expression rate. Deletion of a phenylalanine at the end of the CL linker sequence in our new phagemid design increased scFv production rate and frequency of selected kappa antibodies significantly. The HAL libraries and 834 antibodies selected against 121 targets were analyzed regarding the used germline V-genes, used V-gene combinations and CDR-H3/-L3 length and composition. The amino acid diversity and distribution in the CDR-H3 of the initial library was retrieved in the CDR-H3 of selected antibodies showing that all CDR-H3 amino acids occurring in the human antibody repertoire can be functionally used and is not biased by E. coli expression or phage selection. Further, the data underline the importance of CDR length variations.ConclusionThe highly diverse universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 were constructed using an optimized scFv phagemid vector design. Analysis of selected antibodies revealed that the complete amino acid diversity in the CDR-H3 was also found in selected scFvs showing the functionality of the naive CDR-H3 diversity.",

The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs. Phage selection was performed against various antigens and unique antibodies with excellent biophysical properties were isolated. Our results confirm that quality can be built into an antibody library by prudent selection of unmodified, fully human VH/VL pairs as scaffolds."

Development of therapeutic antibodies was accelerated by recombinant DNA technologies, which allowed the humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies to make them more similar to those of the human body and suitable for a broad range of chronic diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases. In the early 1990s in vitro antibody selection technologies were developed that enabled the discovery of \u201cfully\u201d human antibodies with potentially superior clinical efficacy and lowest immunogenicity. Antibody phage display is the first and most widely used of the in vitro selection technologies. It has proven to be a robust, versatile platform technology for the discovery of human antibodies and a powerful engineering tool to improve antibody properties. As of the beginning of 2016, 6 human antibodies discovered or further developed by phage display were approved for therapy. In 2002, adalimumab (Humira\u00ae) became the first phage display-derived antibody granted a marketing approval. Humira\u00ae was also the first approved human antibody, and it is currently the best-selling antibody drug on the market. Numerous phage display-derived antibodies are currently under advanced clinical investigation, and, despite the availability of other technologies such as human antibody-producing transgenic mice, phage display has not lost its importance for the discovery and engineering of therapeutic antibodies. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview about phage display-derived antibodies that are approved for therapy or in clinical development. A selection of these antibodies is described in more detail to demonstrate different aspects of the phage display technology and its development over the last 25 years.",

From naive antibody gene libraries - in theory - antibodies against any target can be selected. Here we describe the design, construction and characterization of an optimized antibody phage display library.ResultsThe naive antibody gene libraries HAL9 and HAL10, with a combined theoretical diversity of 1.5\u00d71010 independent clones, were constructed from 98 healthy donors using improved phage display vectors. In detail, most common phagemids employed for antibody phage display are using a combined His/Myc tag for detection and purification. We show that changing the tag order to Myc/His improved the production of soluble antibodies, but did not affect antibody phage display. For several published antibody libraries, the selected number of kappa scFvs were lower compared to lambda scFvs, probably due to a lower kappa scFv or Fab expression rate. Deletion of a phenylalanine at the end of the CL linker sequence in our new phagemid design increased scFv production rate and frequency of selected kappa antibodies significantly. The HAL libraries and 834 antibodies selected against 121 targets were analyzed regarding the used germline V-genes, used V-gene combinations and CDR-H3/-L3 length and composition. The amino acid diversity and distribution in the CDR-H3 of the initial library was retrieved in the CDR-H3 of selected antibodies showing that all CDR-H3 amino acids occurring in the human antibody repertoire can be functionally used and is not biased by E. coli expression or phage selection. Further, the data underline the importance of CDR length variations.ConclusionThe highly diverse universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 were constructed using an optimized scFv phagemid vector design. Analysis of selected antibodies revealed that the complete amino acid diversity in the CDR-H3 was also found in selected scFvs showing the functionality of the naive CDR-H3 diversity.",

Individually cloned heavy and light chain variable region libraries were combined in an efficient two-step cloning procedure, permitting the cloning of a total of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 independent Fab clones. The performance of the library was determined by the successful selection of on average 14 different Fabs against 6 antigens tested. These include tetanus toxoid, the hapten phenyl-oxazolone, the breast cancer-associated MUC1 antigen, and three highly related glycoprotein hormones: human chorionic gonadotropin, human luteinizing hormone, and human follicle-stimulating hormone. In the latter category, a panel of either homone-specific or cross-reactive antibodies were identified. The design of the library permits the monitoring of selections with polyclonal phage preparations and to carry out large scale screening of antibody off-rates with unpurified Fab fragments on BIAcore. Antibodies with off-rates in the order of 10\u22122 to 10\u22124s\u22121 and affinities up to 2.7 nm were recovered. The kinetics of these phage antibodies are of the same order of magnitude as antibodies associated with a secondary immune response. This new phage antibody library is set to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets, and to play a vital role in target discovery and validation in the area of functional genomics.",

Over 5000 different target-specific antibodies were isolated to the 28 antigens with 3340 identified as modulating the biological function (e.g. antagonism, agonism) of the target antigen. This represents an average of approximately 120 different functionally active antibodies per target. Analysis of a sample of >800 antibodies from the unselected library indicates V gene usage is representative of the human immune system with no strong bias towards any particular V(H)-V(L) pairing. Germline diversity is broad with 45/49 functional V(H) germlines and 28/30 V(lambda) and 30/35 V(kappa) light-chain germlines represented in the sample. The number of functional V(H) germlines and V(kappa) light-chain germlines present is increased to 48/49 and 31/35, respectively, when selected V gene usage is included in the analysis. However, following selection on the antigen panel, V(H)1-V(lambda)1 germline family pairings are preferentially enriched and represent a remarkable 25% of the antigen-specific selected repertoire.",

The implantation of a robust platform of antibody discovery technologies allows reaching this goal. Additionally to recombinant antibody selection, antibody engineering technologies were developed and explored to obtain desired characteristics of selected leading candidates such as high affinity, low immunogenicity, improved functionality, improved protein production, improved stability, and others. mAb humanization methods emerged as alternative for generating humanized variants of promising candidates obtained from non-human organism that could elicit an immune response. This chapter contains an overview of discovery technologies, mainly display methods and antibody humanization methods for the selection of therapeutic humanized and human mAbs that appeared along the development of these technologies and thereafter. The increasing applications of phage display technology will be highlighted in the antibody engineering area (affinity maturation, guided selection to obtain human antibodies) giving promising perspectives for the development of future therapeutics."

In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity (Barbas et al., 1991), (Vaughan et al., 1996), [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires (Barbas et al., 1992), (Barbas, 1995), (Knappik et al., 2000), (Fellouse et al., 2004). A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity (Knappik et al., 2000), (Rothe et al., 2008), (Kruif et al., 1995), (Yin et al., 2008). One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16].",

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

The HCDR3 regions varied in length between 6 and 15 residues and were designed to contain fully randomized stretches of amino acid residues flanked by regions of limited residue variability that were composed of amino acid residues that frequently occur in natural antibodies. We reasoned that this approach would increase the frequency of functional molecules in our library and, in addition, permit us to efficiently utilize available cloning space. By direct selection on solid phase-bound antigens we obtained phage antibodies with binding activities to 13 different antigens, including Von Willebrand factor, the DNA-binding HMG box of transcription factor TCF-1 and the tumor antigen EGP-2. In addition, we applied a competitive selection procedure to target phage antibodies to the desired portion of a recombinant fusion protein and to select phage antibodies capable of discriminating between the two highly homologous homeobox proteins PBX1a and PBX2. The functional capacity of monoclonal phage antibodies was assessed in immuno-histochemical staining of tissue specimens. Western blotting assays and immunofluorescent analysis of cells by flow cytometry. The results demonstrate that this large human phage antibody library contains a broad assortment of binding specificities that can be applied in a variety of biochemical assays.",

Libraries were constructed such that solvent-accessible CDR positions were randomized with a degenerate codon that encoded for only four amino acids (tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and serine). Nonetheless, high-affinity Fabs (K(d) = 2-10 nM) were isolated against human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF), and the crystal structures were determined for two distinct Fab-hVEGF complexes. The structures revealed that antigen recognition was mediated primarily by tyrosine side chains, which accounted for 71% of the Fab surface area that became buried upon binding to hVEGF. In contrast, aspartate residues within the CDRs were almost entirely excluded from the binding interface. Alanine and serine residues did not make many direct contacts with antigen, but they allowed for space and conformational flexibility and thus played an auxiliary role in facilitating productive contacts between tyrosine and antigen. Tyrosine side chains were capable of mediating most of the contacts necessary for high-affinity antigen recognition, and, thus, it seems likely that the overabundance of tyrosine in natural antigen-binding sites is a consequence of the side chain being particularly well suited for making productive contacts with antigen. The findings shed light on the basic principles governing the evolution of natural immune repertoires and should also aid the development of improved synthetic antibody libraries.",

Sequencing analysis indicated that >60% of colonies had completely correct scFv genes and the amino acid composition and distribution were designed well in accordance. The utility was demonstrated by screening of scFv clones against BHL (anti-CD3 x anti-ovarian carcinoma bispecific antibody).

The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it the amino acid that is most effective for mediating molecular recognition, and protein engineers have taken advantage of these characteristics to build tyrosine-rich protein binding sites that outperform natural proteins in terms of affinity and specificity.

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes.",

Four amino acid residues of the third hypervariable loop (CDR3) of both VH and VL were combinatorially mutated, generating a repertoire of approximately 5x10(7) independent scFvs, cloned in a phagemid vector. The ability of the antibody phage library to yield specific binders was tested by biopanning against several antigens. Successful selection of fully active scFvs was obtained, confirming the notion that combinatorial mutagenesis of few amino acid residues centrally located in the antigen-binding site is sufficient to provide binding specificities against virtually any target. High yields of both soluble and phage antibodies were obtained in Escherichia coli. Maintenance of the cognate scFv antibody stability in the newly selected scFv fragments was demonstrated by guanidinium chloride denaturation/renaturation studies and by soluble antibody expression in the bacterial cytoplasm. The antibody library described here allows the isolation of new stable binding specificities, potentially exploitable as immunochemical reagents for intracellular applications.",

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

Concurrent evolution of the libraries has allowed display and selection technologies to reveal their full potential. They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design."

The constant evolution of microorganisms magnifies the problem as it facilitates the re-emergence of old infectious diseases as well as promote the introduction of new and more deadly variants. Evidently, infectious diseases have contributed to an alarming rate of mortality worldwide making it a growing concern. Historically, antibodies have been used successfully to prevent and treat infectious diseases since the nineteenth century using antisera collected from immunized animals. The inherent ability of antibodies to trigger effector mechanisms aids the immune system to fight off pathogens that invades the host. Immune libraries have always been an important source of antibodies for infectious diseases due to the skewed repertoire generated post infection. Even so, the role and ability of na\u00efve antibody libraries should not be underestimated. The na\u00efve repertoire has its own unique advantages in generating antibodies against target antigens. This chapter will highlight the concept, advantages and application of human na\u00efve libraries as a source to isolate antibodies against infectious disease target antigens.",

Development of therapeutic antibodies was accelerated by recombinant DNA technologies, which allowed the humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies to make them more similar to those of the human body and suitable for a broad range of chronic diseases like cancer and autoimmune diseases. In the early 1990s in vitro antibody selection technologies were developed that enabled the discovery of \u201cfully\u201d human antibodies with potentially superior clinical efficacy and lowest immunogenicity. Antibody phage display is the first and most widely used of the in vitro selection technologies. It has proven to be a robust, versatile platform technology for the discovery of human antibodies and a powerful engineering tool to improve antibody properties. As of the beginning of 2016, 6 human antibodies discovered or further developed by phage display were approved for therapy. In 2002, adalimumab (Humira\u00ae) became the first phage display-derived antibody granted a marketing approval. Humira\u00ae was also the first approved human antibody, and it is currently the best-selling antibody drug on the market. Numerous phage display-derived antibodies are currently under advanced clinical investigation, and, despite the availability of other technologies such as human antibody-producing transgenic mice, phage display has not lost its importance for the discovery and engineering of therapeutic antibodies. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview about phage display-derived antibodies that are approved for therapy or in clinical development. A selection of these antibodies is described in more detail to demonstrate different aspects of the phage display technology and its development over the last 25 years."

An antibody library, a large collection of diverse, pre-constructed antibodies, can be rapidly screened using in vitro display technologies such as phage display. One of the keys to successful in vitro antibody discovery is the quality of the library diversity. Antibody diversity can be obtained either from natural B-cell sources or by the synthetic methods that combinatorially generate random nucleotide sequences. While the functionality of a natural antibody library depends largely upon the library size, various other factors can affect the quality of a synthetic antibody library, making the design and construction of synthetic antibody libraries complicated and challenging. In this review, we present various library designs and diversification methods for synthetic antibody library. From simple degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis to trinucleotide synthesis to physicochemically optimized library design, the synthetic approach is evolving beyond the simple emulation of natural antibodies, into a highly sophisticated method that is capable of producing high quality antibodies suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic, and other demanding applications.

Here, we describe the first fully synthetic phage display library of humanized llama single domain antibody (NaLi-H1: Nanobody Library Humanized 1). Based on a humanized synthetic single domain antibody (hs2dAb) scaffold optimized for intracellular stability, the highly diverse library provides high affinity binders without animal immunization. NaLi-H1 was screened following several selection schemes against various targets (Fluorescent proteins, actin, tubulin, p53, HP1). Conformation antibodies against active RHO GTPase were also obtained. Selected hs2dAb were used in various immunoassays and were often found to be functional intrabodies, enabling tracking or inhibition of endogenous targets. Functionalization of intrabodies allowed specific protein knockdown in living cells. Finally, direct selection against the surface of tumor cells produced hs2dAb directed against tumor-specific antigens further highlighting the potential use of this library for therapeutic applications.

Antibodies are becoming an increasingly promising modality to target these receptors due to their unique properties, such as exquisite specificity, long half-life, and fewer side effects, and their improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to peptides and small molecules, which results from their more favorable biodistribution. To date, there are only two US Food and Drug Administration-approved GPCR antibody drugs, namely erenumab and mogamulizumab, and this highlights the challenges encountered in identifying functional antibodies against GPCRs. Utilizing Twist\u2019s precision DNA writing technologies, we have created a GPCR-focused phage display library with 1 \u00d7 1010 diversity. Specifically, we mined endogenous GPCR binding ligand and peptide sequences and incorporated these binding motifs into the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 in a synthetic antibody library. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1 R) is a class B GPCR that acts as the receptor for the incretin GLP-1, which is released to regulate insulin levels in response to food intake. GLP-1 R agonists have been widely used to increase insulin secretion to lower blood glucose levels for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, whereas GLP-1 R antagonists have applications in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery and hyperinsulinomic hypoglycemia. Here we present the discovery and creation of both antagonistic and agonistic GLP-1 R antibodies by panning this GPCR-focused phage display library on a GLP-1 R-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cell line and demonstrate their in vitro and in vivo functional activity."

Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors...Immune libraries are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36]37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs).",

A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36]37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs).",

The V gene repertoires are harvested from populations of lymphocytes, or assembled in vitro, and cloned for display of associated heavy and light chain variable domains on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage. Rare phage are selected from the repertoire by binding to antigen; soluble antibody fragments are expressed from infected bacteria; and the affinity of binding of selected antibodies is improved by mutation. The process mimics immune selection, and antibodies with many different binding specificities have been isolated from the same phage repertoire. Thus human antibody fragments have been isolated with specificities against both foreign and self antigens, including haptens, carbohydrates, secreted and cell surface proteins, viral coat proteins, and intracellular antigens from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. Such antibodies have potential as reagents for research and in therapy."

They come in different flavors, from na\u00efve to fully synthetic and differ in terms of size, quality, method of preparation, framework and CDR composition. Early on, the focus has mainly been on affinities and thus on library size and diversity. Subsequently, the increased awareness of developability and cost of goods as important success factors has spurred efforts to generate libraries with improved biophysical properties and favorable production characteristics. More recently a major focus on reduction of unwanted side effects through reduced immunogenicity and improved overall biophysical behavior has led to a re-evaluation of library design."

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

                "tldr": "Phage display is a powerful technology that enables the screening of large antibody libraries to discover therapeutic candidates. This technique uses bacteriophages to physically link antibody proteins to their encoding genetic material, allowing for the efficient selection of antibodies with desired binding properties. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nPhage display libraries represent a revolutionary technology in therapeutic antibody discovery, providing a high-throughput platform for screening billions of antibody candidates simultaneously. At its core, phage display exploits bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) as vehicles to express antibody fragments on their surface while carrying the corresponding genetic information inside. This physical linkage between phenotype (the displayed antibody) and genotype (the encoding DNA) is the key feature that enables rapid selection of antibodies with specific binding properties.\n\nThe technology works through an iterative process called biopanning, where libraries of phage-displayed antibodies are exposed to an immobilized target antigen. Phages displaying antibodies that bind to the target are captured, while non-binding phages are washed away. The bound phages are then eluted, amplified in bacterial hosts, and subjected to additional rounds of selection to enrich for the highest affinity binders. After several rounds of this selection process, individual clones can be isolated, sequenced, and characterized.\n\nThe power of phage display lies in its ability to mimic natural antibody selection while accelerating the discovery process and bypassing traditional hybridoma technology limitations. Modern phage display libraries can contain 10^9 to 10^11 unique antibody sequences, providing exceptional diversity for therapeutic discovery campaigns. The source of this diversity\u2014whether derived from natural immune repertoires, synthetic designs, or combinations of both\u2014significantly impacts the characteristics of the antibodies that can be discovered. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

The latter are produced by cloning the antibody genes from immunised animals (e.g. [7][8][9]) or diseased or vaccinated humans [10,11] and are directed towards a single or limited number of antigens. Na\u00efve phage display libraries are produced from the natural antibody repertoire of donors. Alternatively, phage display libraries can be produced using a relatively small diversity of natural antibody sequences whose diversity is increased through mutating one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (semi-synthetic libraries). Libraries can also be based on a single or very low number of \"scaffold\" sequences with introduced diversity in the CDRs (synthetic libraries). Immune libraries require immunisation and library cloning for each antigen but small repertoire libraries (~ 10^6) usually facilitate the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [7][8][9]). On the other hand, na\u00efve or synthetic/semi-synthetic libraries (collectively known as single-pot libraries) can be used against any antigen but are required to have very high diversity (typically > 10^10) to allow the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [12][13][14][15][16])."

The classification of the antibody libraries are mainly influenced by the source of antibody V genes for library generation (Ponsel et al., 2011). Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using V genes from non-immunized donors (Ponsel et al., 2011)(Lim et al., 2016). Immune antibody libraries however are constructed utilizing antibody V genes from immunized donors or infected individuals (Ponsel et al., 2011). Synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries are constructed using synthesized DNA oligonucleotides where the repertoire diversity is devoid of any natural immune maturation processes (Miersch et al., 2012)",
                            "Na\u00efve antibody libraries are constructed using B cells of unimmunized or healthy donors, normally focusing on the IgM isotype. Na\u00efve libraries are supposedly able to be used for the isolation of mAbs against any antigen (Moon et al., 2011)",
                            "However, antibodies isolated from na\u00efve antibody libraries usually exhibit lower affinities compared to antibodies isolated from immunized libraries. This is because the na\u00efve repertoire would not have undergone in vivo affinity maturation to produce higher affinity antibodies (Moon et al., 2011)."

Examples of na\u00efve universal libraries are the human Fab library constructed by de Haard and colleagues at Dyax (now Shire) (Haard et al., 1999), the scFv libraries from Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) (Vaughan et al., 1996)(Lloyd et al., 2008), scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA59, and the HAL scFv libraries (Hust et al., 2011)(K\u00fcgler et al., 2015). Fully synthetic libraries are constructed to include synthetic genes derived from known (human) antibody frameworks with the capacity to generate a large diversity in appropriate regions (Nelson et al., 2012). Semi-synthetic libraries are a combination of natural (i.e., donor-derived antibody) and synthetic antibody sequences (Hoet et al., 2005). A combination of na\u00efve and synthetic repertoires was used for the Dyax FAB310 library. Fully-synthetic libraries were developed by MorphoSys (Frenzel et al., 2016)."

                            "Antibody libraries can be constructed from natural sources by isolating the B cells of a source animal that has been immunized with the target antigen and using the isolated antibody genes to create the antibody library. 31 These kind of libraries have a strong bias toward the antigen, and even a modest-sized library can be sufficient to isolate specific binders. However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. (Li et al., 2000)",
                            "n the other hand, nai \u0308ve antibody libraries can be constructed completely in vitro resulting in nonimmunized, (Vaughan et al., 1996) synthetic, 47 or semisynthetic libraries. (Barbas et al., 1992) The use of synthetic repertoires bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences. (Knappik et al., 2000) Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). (Hoogenboom, 2005) Synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce diversity into the CDRs."

                            "Phage display libraries can be constructed using antibody variable (v) genes isolated from IgM mRNA of non-immunised human donor B cells derived from diverse lymphoid sources such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), spleen cells, tonsils, bone marrow or from nonimmunised animal B cells (na\u00efve antibody libraries). IgG mRNA from PBLs or spleen cells of immunised animals or human patients are used to build immunised libraries. A third class called synthetic and semi-synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using repertoires of rearranged V genes from gene segments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and introducing variation into their CDR regions using custom degenerate primers encoding for diversity and length (Winter et al., 1994). \n\nImmunised libraries are generally constructed using antibody VH and VL genes amplified from the mRNA of B cell pools from immunised animals or human donors. Post immunisation, the antibody secreting B cells possess a higher percentage of antigen specific heavy and light chain gene transcripts. These B cells would have undergone affinity maturation and isotype switching in germinal centres before entering into the peripheral circulation. Typically antibodies isolated from immunised libraries will have a high affinity and tighter specificity for the immunogens used [8] and can be achieved even from relatively small library diversity (Winter et al., 1994)."

The rabbit was immunised with a mixture of protein conjugates of four different haptens, namely the herbicide mecoprop and derivatives of the herbicides atrazine, simazine, and isoproturon. An scFv phage display library was constructed, and several scFvs with high affinity against each hapten were isolated. For each hapten, a single binder was selected by k(off) ranking and used for affinity determination. The affinities were in sub-nanomolar range and the lowest K(d) value obtained was 6.75 x 10(-10) M. An unusual feature of one of the anti-isoproturon scFvs was its ability to retain binding activity at pH1.7. The utility and potential of using a single animal and immunisation with multiple antigens for the production of multiple, specific, high affinity scFvs by phage display is discussed."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

Ylanthia comprises 36 fixed immunoglobulin (Ig) variable heavy (VH)/variable light (VL) chain pairs, which cover a broad range of canonical complementarity-determining region (CDR) structures. The variable Ig heavy and Ig light (VH/VL) chain pairs were selected for biophysical characteristics favorable to manufacturing and development. The selection process included multiple parameters, e.g., assessment of protein expression yield, thermal stability and aggregation propensity in fragment antigen binding (Fab) and IgG1 formats, and relative Fab display rate on phage. The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs. Phage selection was performed against various antigens and unique antibodies with excellent biophysical properties were isolated. Our results confirm that quality can be built into an antibody library by prudent selection of unmodified, fully human VH/VL pairs as scaffolds."

                            "There are many types of phage display libraries such as natural, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic; and they are classified by the source of their sequences (19). A natural library can be obtained from various human B-cells and are relatively similar to the natural human antibody repertoire. Immune libraries are constructed from infection-recovered humans or immunized animals and can yield high affinity binders against targets from a small sized immune library (~10 6 ). The diversity of a semi-synthetic library is increased through mutating one or more CDRs by using oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis or mixing synthetic and natural sequences (Ponsel et al., 2011)19). A synthetic library is composed of artificially designed and synthesized antibody sequences (Lee et al., 2004)21). Engineered semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries have several advantages including the use of scaffolds with highly stable properties and codon-optimized sequences with high expression levels (21, 22). Generally, immune libraries are directed towards limited number of targets. Natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic libraries can be used to isolate high affinity binders against broad antigens but are required to have very high diversity (~10 10 to 10 11 )."

                            "Phage display libraries included natural antibody libraries, semi-synthetic antibody libraries, and synthetic antibody libraries. Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002)(Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams et al., 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015)."

An antibody library, a large collection of diverse, pre-constructed antibodies, can be rapidly screened using in vitro display technologies such as phage display. One of the keys to successful in vitro antibody discovery is the quality of the library diversity. Antibody diversity can be obtained either from natural B-cell sources or by the synthetic methods that combinatorially generate random nucleotide sequences. While the functionality of a natural antibody library depends largely upon the library size, various other factors can affect the quality of a synthetic antibody library, making the design and construction of synthetic antibody libraries complicated and challenging."

Recent research suggests that increasing the number of donors can enhance library diversity, as individuals possess unique immune systems and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes <Paper corpusId=\"269574517\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232296539\" paperTitle=\"(Erasmus et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Additionally, natural libraries based on variable genes from circulating human B lymphocytes may be partially depleted for sequences reacting against self-antigens, potentially limiting their effectiveness for isolating antibodies targeting human proteins <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Immune Libraries\n\nImmune libraries are constructed using B cells from immunized animals or humans previously exposed to specific antigens or pathogens <Paper corpusId=\"145820057\" paperTitle=\"(Sokullu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6294096\" paperTitle=\"(Loureiro et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

For instance, a comparison of libraries derived from spleen and lymph nodes revealed that immunization substantially increased the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen in both organs <Paper corpusId=\"34807723\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Interestingly, libraries derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice were found to be the most diverse and effective in generating diverse and high-affinity candidates <Paper corpusId=\"34807723\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe primary limitation of immune libraries is that they require construction of a new library for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is possible <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21653640\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, an immune response must be generated to the antigen of interest, which may not be possible for all targets <Paper corpusId=\"23146468\" paperTitle=\"(Nixon et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, phage display can enable the isolation of antibodies to targets not easily found via hybridoma or single B-cell screening technologies, such as toxins and self-antigens <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key strength of phage display methodology is its potential independence from animal involvement for generating fully human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies when using na\u00efve or synthetic libraries <Paper corpusId=\"261768481\" paperTitle=\"(Franca et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Fully synthetic libraries are constructed to include synthetic genes derived from known (human) antibody frameworks with the capacity to generate a large diversity in appropriate regions (Nelson et al., 2012). Semi-synthetic libraries are a combination of natural (i.e., donor-derived antibody) and synthetic antibody sequences (Hoet et al., 2005).

Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest. Alternatively, single large na\u00efve, 13 synthetic, 14,15 or semi-synthetic libraries (where synthetic diversity is combined with natural diversity) 12 have been shown to be capable of producing high affinity antibodies (K d < 10nM) to a wide range of structurally diverse antigens.

                            "Phage display libraries can be constructed using antibody variable (v) genes isolated from IgM mRNA of non-immunised human donor B cells derived from diverse lymphoid sources such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), spleen cells, tonsils, bone marrow or from nonimmunised animal B cells (na\u00efve antibody libraries). IgG mRNA from PBLs or spleen cells of immunised animals or human patients are used to build immunised libraries. A third class called synthetic and semi-synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using repertoires of rearranged V genes from gene segments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and introducing variation into their CDR regions using custom degenerate primers encoding for diversity and length (Winter et al., 1994). \n\nImmunised libraries are generally constructed using antibody VH and VL genes amplified from the mRNA of B cell pools from immunised animals or human donors. Post immunisation, the antibody secreting B cells possess a higher percentage of antigen specific heavy and light chain gene transcripts. These B cells would have undergone affinity maturation and isotype switching in germinal centres before entering into the peripheral circulation. Typically antibodies isolated from immunised libraries will have a high affinity and tighter specificity for the immunogens used [8] and can be achieved even from relatively small library diversity (Winter et al., 1994)."

Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes (Wang et al., 2016)(Erasmus et al., 2021). Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies."

                            "Strategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity (Barbas et al., 1991), (Vaughan et al., 1996), [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires (Barbas et al., 1992), (Barbas, 1995), (Knappik et al., 2000), (Fellouse et al., 2004). A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity (Knappik et al., 2000), (Rothe et al., 2008), (Kruif et al., 1995), (Yin et al., 2008). One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16]."

However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. (Li et al., 2000)",

(Knappik et al., 2000) Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).

                            "Phage antibody libraries are classed as na\u00efve, semisynthetic, synthetic or immune libraries [2]. The latter are produced by cloning the antibody genes from immunised animals (e.g. [7][8][9]) or diseased or vaccinated humans [10,11] and are directed towards a single or limited number of antigens. Na\u00efve phage display libraries are produced from the natural antibody repertoire of donors. Alternatively, phage display libraries can be produced using a relatively small diversity of natural antibody sequences whose diversity is increased through mutating one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (semi-synthetic libraries). Libraries can also be based on a single or very low number of \"scaffold\" sequences with introduced diversity in the CDRs (synthetic libraries). Immune libraries require immunisation and library cloning for each antigen but small repertoire libraries (~ 10^6) usually facilitate the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [7][8][9]). On the other hand, na\u00efve or synthetic/semi-synthetic libraries (collectively known as single-pot libraries) can be used against any antigen but are required to have very high diversity (typically > 10^10) to allow the isolation of high affinity binders (e.g. [12][13][14][15][16])."

The V gene repertoires are harvested from populations of lymphocytes, or assembled in vitro, and cloned for display of associated heavy and light chain variable domains on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage. Rare phage are selected from the repertoire by binding to antigen; soluble antibody fragments are expressed from infected bacteria; and the affinity of binding of selected antibodies is improved by mutation. The process mimics immune selection, and antibodies with many different binding specificities have been isolated from the same phage repertoire. Thus human antibody fragments have been isolated with specificities against both foreign and self antigens, including haptens, carbohydrates, secreted and cell surface proteins, viral coat proteins, and intracellular antigens from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. Such antibodies have potential as reagents for research and in therapy."

Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, constitute interesting sources of diversity because they are rich in B cells, part of which can be affinity matured. These organs, however, differ in their anatomical structure, reflecting the different fluids they drain, which affects the B cell repertoires. The CDRH3 repertoires from these organs, extracted from na\u00efve or immunized mice, were compared in the context of phage display libraries using human antibody framework families. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that all libraries displayed different CDRH3 repertoires, but the one derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice was the most diverse. Library performance was assessed by in vitro selection. For both organs, immunization increased substantially the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen. The library derived from lymph nodes from na\u00efve mice, however, was the most effective in generating diverse and high affinity candidates. These results illustrate that the use of a biased CDRH3 repertoire increases the performance of libraries, but reduces the clonal diversity, which may be detrimental for certain strategies."

The rabbit was immunised with a mixture of protein conjugates of four different haptens, namely the herbicide mecoprop and derivatives of the herbicides atrazine, simazine, and isoproturon. An scFv phage display library was constructed, and several scFvs with high affinity against each hapten were isolated. For each hapten, a single binder was selected by k(off) ranking and used for affinity determination. The affinities were in sub-nanomolar range and the lowest K(d) value obtained was 6.75 x 10(-10) M. An unusual feature of one of the anti-isoproturon scFvs was its ability to retain binding activity at pH1.7. The utility and potential of using a single animal and immunisation with multiple antigens for the production of multiple, specific, high affinity scFvs by phage display is discussed."

                "tldr": "Synthetic libraries are constructed using engineered framework sequences with precisely designed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), enabling controlled diversity and optimized biophysical properties. Unlike natural libraries, synthetic designs can incorporate rational elements to improve stability, expression, and developability while avoiding immunogenic features. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nSynthetic libraries represent a fundamentally different approach to antibody discovery compared to natural libraries. While natural libraries derive from B-cell repertoires, synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using engineered framework sequences with diversified CDRs <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3902072\" paperTitle=\"(Aghebati-Maleki et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This distinction gives synthetic libraries several unique characteristics and advantages.\n\nSynthetic libraries can be divided into two main categories: those based on a single-core V-gene and those based on multiple-core V-genes <Paper corpusId=\"14089112\" paperTitle=\"(Tikunova et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. The key advantage of synthetic design is that the composition of CDRs can be precisely defined and controlled <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This control enables researchers to engineer antibody frameworks with optimal biophysical properties and avoid undesirable sequences that might compromise developability.\n\nThe design process for synthetic libraries typically involves selecting stable framework regions and then introducing diversity into the CDRs through various methods. One approach uses trinucleotide synthesis, which allows complete control over amino acid composition in the CDRs <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technique has enabled the creation of minimalistic antibody libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids in the randomized CDR regions <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17004545\" paperTitle=\"(Koide et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Interestingly, studies have shown that tyrosine residues play a dominant role in mediating molecular contacts, while small serine/glycine residues provide space and flexibility in these minimalist binding sites <Paper corpusId=\"17004545\" paperTitle=\"(Koide et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother advantage of synthetic libraries is that they can be designed to avoid potential immunogenicity issues. Unlike natural libraries that may contain somatic hypermutations in framework regions that could elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) responses, synthetic libraries can be engineered with frameworks optimized for reduced immunogenicity <Paper corpusId=\"18731451\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, it's worth noting that the CDRs of synthetic libraries can still be immunogenic if the sequences are not naturally present in the human antibody repertoire <Paper corpusId=\"11214996\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSynthetic libraries also overcome certain limitations of natural libraries. They bypass the need to isolate antibody genes and can be engineered to avoid potential post-translational modification sites within the CDRs <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, synthetic libraries can be designed to exclude sequences that are toxic to E. coli, which can improve library functionality by ensuring better display of antibodies on phage surfaces <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these advantages, synthetic libraries face challenges. The random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences that may affect folding and function <Paper corpusId=\"18731451\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address this, some synthetic approaches incorporate design elements that mimic natural diversity patterns <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn terms of performance, synthetic libraries with moderate size have yielded antibodies with monovalent affinities in the nanomolar range, while larger libraries have produced antibodies with affinities in the sub-nanomolar to picomolar range <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. The quality of a synthetic library depends not just on its size but on multiple factors affecting diversity, making their design and construction more complex than natural libraries <Paper corpusId=\"7300202\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent approaches have focused on creating synthetic libraries that not only provide high affinity but also superior developability. For instance, some researchers have created libraries comprising natural CDR sequences purged of sequence liabilities, embedded within frameworks derived from successful therapeutic antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"244774503\" paperTitle=\"(Teixeira et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach aims to combine the benefits of natural diversity with engineered frameworks to enhance the likelihood of discovering antibodies that will succeed in clinical development.",

                            "According to the source of antibody-encoding sequences, phage antibody libraries (PALs) are divided into two main types of natural and synthetic libraries. Natural PALs consist of rearranged V gene repertoires of immune or non-immune (na\u00efve) donors",
                            "Immune libraries are constructed from immunized donors and typically exploited to obtain antibodies against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious viral or bacterial agent. A great advantage of immune PALs is that V genes harbor hypermutations and are affinity matured, though the toxicity of some antigens and ethical issues make it impossible to immunize human subjects with toxic, immunosuppressive, and life-threatening antigens. If immunization is not possible or is ethically impracticable, the construction of non-immune or na\u00efve PALs is an alternative. These libraries are generated from rearranged V gene repertoires of B cells derived from healthy and non-immunized donors. Accordingly, ethical issues with regard to the active immunization of humans and animals are avoided. Also, specific antibodies against non-immunogenic and toxic antigens can also be obtained. However, the isolated antibodies generally show low affinity. This emphasizes the need to improve binding affinity of the selected antibodies by using affinity maturation in vitro [36]37]. Unlike natural PALs that represent the naturally occurring diversity in the antibody repertoire, synthetic PALs harbor artificial diversity in V gene segments. In these PALs, V genes are reconstructed in vitro partially (semi-synthetic PALs) or completely (fully synthetic PALs)."

                            "Combinatorial libraries built with severely restricted chemical diversity have yielded highly functional synthetic binding proteins. Structural analyses of these minimalist binding sites have revealed the dominant role of large tyrosine residues for mediating molecular contacts and of small serine/glycine residues for providing space and flexibility. The concept of using limited residue types to construct optimized binding proteins mirrors findings in the field of small molecule drug development, where it has been proposed that most drugs are built from a limited set of side chains presented by diverse frameworks. The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it the amino acid that is most effective for mediating molecular recognition, and protein engineers have taken advantage of these characteristics to build tyrosine-rich protein binding sites that outperform natural proteins in terms of affinity and specificity. Knowledge from preceding studies can be used to improve current designs, and thus synthetic protein libraries will continue to evolve and improve. In the near future, it seems likely that synthetic binding proteins will supersede natural antibodies for most purposes, and moreover, synthetic proteins will enable many new applications beyond the scope of natural proteins."

                            "One important factor in library design is the source and nature of the sequence diversity, which can originate from natural (animal B-cells), synthetic, or semi-synthetic sources.\n\nAntibody libraries from natural sources consist of antibody clones with variable regions that are the end product of V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation of germline immunoglobulin genes, all of which are presumably optimized through the evolutionary history of adaptive immunity. Antibodies isolated from a natural antibody library are thus generally considered more nature-like than those from a synthetic antibody library, whose diversity typically is generated by random combinatorial events. On the other hand, the greater heterogeneity of the framework regions among the clones of natural antibody libraries may result in more uneven propagation of the clones during the amplification phase of biopanning. Also, somatic hypermutations, especially in the framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that can elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response when the antibody is used as a therapeutic agent.\n\nSynthetic antibody libraries usually have one or a small number of framework sequences, upon which artificially designed and synthesized CDR sequences are grafted. The CDR diversity is mostly generated by concatenating random nucleotides [2][3][4] or trinucleotide units [5][6][7]. Various CDR design strategies have been employed to emulate natural CDRs. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences to the library."

With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.\n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation."

However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. (Li et al., 2000)",

(Knappik et al., 2000) Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).

                            "Strategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity (Barbas et al., 1991), (Vaughan et al., 1996), [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires (Barbas et al., 1992), (Barbas, 1995), (Knappik et al., 2000), (Fellouse et al., 2004). A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity (Knappik et al., 2000), (Rothe et al., 2008), (Kruif et al., 1995), (Yin et al., 2008). One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16]."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

These libraries typically use natural frameworks with synthetically designed CDRs, enabling researchers to leverage natural stability while introducing controlled diversity. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nSemi-synthetic antibody libraries represent a hybrid approach that combines elements from both natural and synthetic libraries <Paper corpusId=\"1009199\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Unlike purely natural libraries derived from B cells or fully synthetic libraries designed entirely in silico, semi-synthetic libraries integrate natural antibody sequences with synthetically designed diversity <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combination allows researchers to leverage the benefits of both approaches while mitigating their individual limitations.\n\nThe most common strategy for developing semi-synthetic libraries involves using naturally occurring framework regions while introducing synthetic diversity into one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The ratio of naturally-derived and synthetically-designed parts varies considerably across different libraries, ranging from minimal synthetic elements to predominantly synthetic designs with only select natural components <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOne of the earliest semi-synthetic libraries was reported in 1992, created by rearranging 49 human VH gene segments with five to eight residues of synthetic CDR to yield a semi-synthetic single-chain fragment variable (scFv) library <Paper corpusId=\"55838761\" paperTitle=\"(Ch'ng et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Since then, various approaches have been developed, including libraries that combine synthetic and natural fragments <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSemi-synthetic libraries can be constructed through several methods. One approach involves introducing synthetic diversity into a na\u00efve library by PCR assembly of germline genes <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Another method employs recombination of in vivo formed CDRs, allowing for the creation of novel sequences while maintaining natural structural elements <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some semi-synthetic libraries incorporate antibody variable genes derived from immunized subjects to create a bias toward specific antigens <Paper corpusId=\"18010184\" paperTitle=\"(Bonvin et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA particularly innovative approach involves combining synthetic and natural diversity through oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis <Paper corpusId=\"232296539\" paperTitle=\"(Erasmus et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, the ALTHEA Gold library incorporated a heat shock step followed by protein A recovery during construction to enhance solubility and thermostability. This process selected for stable and well-folded antibodies, resulting in decreased frequency of hydrophobic residues in diversified CDR positions while positively selecting for charged residues <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe development of trinucleotide synthesis methods has been particularly valuable for semi-synthetic library construction, allowing full control of amino acid composition in the CDRs <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technique has enabled the creation of minimalistic antibody libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids in randomized CDR regions <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17004545\" paperTitle=\"(Koide et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSemi-synthetic libraries offer several advantages. They bypass the need to isolate antibody genes for each new target and can be engineered with optimal framework sequences that exhibit favorable biophysical properties <Paper corpusId=\"198254683\" paperTitle=\"(Peltomaa et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. They also allow for the generation of novel sequences that can target self-antigens while preventing the creation of synthetic sequences with high levels of T-cell epitopes that might be strongly immunogenic <Paper corpusId=\"11214996\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn terms of performance, large semi-synthetic libraries have yielded antibodies with affinities in the sub-nanomolar range <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. When compared to natural libraries, semi-synthetic libraries typically offer improved functional diversity and can be designed to address specific challenges such as bacterial expression toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor universal application against diverse targets, semi-synthetic libraries (like na\u00efve and synthetic libraries) generally require very high diversity, typically in the range of 10^10 to 10^11 members, to allow isolation of high-affinity binders <Paper corpusId=\"269059585\" paperTitle=\"(Zheng et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7300202\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The quality of these libraries is evaluated not just by their size but also by their diversity <Paper corpusId=\"269059585\" paperTitle=\"(Zheng et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOverall, semi-synthetic libraries represent a pragmatic middle ground in antibody discovery, combining the natural evolution-optimized features of naturally occurring antibodies with the precise control and design flexibility of synthetic approaches <Paper corpusId=\"23146468\" paperTitle=\"(Nixon et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

While the first two are based entirely on naturally occurring sequence diversity, synthetic libraries are diversified according to design. Semi-synthetic libraries combine natural diversity for certain aspects of the library with in silico design. Although the combinatorial aspect is most prominent in semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries, na\u00efve and immune libraries also feature certain combinatorial aspects, e.g. the random pairing of heavy and light chains.

                            "According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library.\n\nIn a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose.\n\nIn order to enhance the library solubility and thermostability, a heat shock step, followed by a protein A recovery, was incorporated in the construction of the semisynthetic ALTHEA Gold library. This is based on the observation that heat denaturation selected stable and well-folded antibodies. Validation of the library showed that the overall frequency of hydrophobic residues at diversified CDR positions decreased after heat shock and protein A selection. In contrast, charged residues were positively selected by the filtration process. By panning the library against a diverse panel of antigens, the scFvs selected exhibited high affinity (KD ranges from single-digit nM to sub-nM), solubility (>50 mg/L), and thermal stability (Tm > 70\u00b0C), which agree with biophysical parameters of therapeutic antibodies."

The first semisynthetic library was reported in 1992, in which rearrangement of 49 human VH gene segments with five to eight residues of synthetic CDR was carried out to yield a semi-synthetic singlechain fragment variable (scFv) library (Benhar, 2007). The key difference between semi-and fully synthetic libraries is the source of the diversity. In semi-synthetic libraries, the diversity is largely obtained from natural sources whereby the genes encoding the CDR are isolated. These CDR genes are then inserted to a fixed framework sequence, which encodes the antibody backbone (Lim et al., 2014)(Ponsel et al., 2011). The diversity is still natural, taking advantage of the maturation processes of antibodies in vivo. The application of synthetic antibodies to develop antibodies for diagnostic applications has allowed the generation of antibodies against various antigens of diagnostic value."

(Hoet et al., 2005) irst-generation phage display antibody libraries were na\u00efve. (Marks et al., 1991) Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library."

However, construction of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible. (Li et al., 2000)",

(Barbas et al., 1992) The use of synthetic repertoires bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences. (Knappik et al., 2000) Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a nai \u0308ve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). (Hoogenboom, 2005) Synthetic libraries are constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce diversity into the CDRs."

In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described (Hust et al., 2004). In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen (Persson et al., 1991)(Tikunova et al., 2012). In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher."

                            "Combinatorial libraries built with severely restricted chemical diversity have yielded highly functional synthetic binding proteins. Structural analyses of these minimalist binding sites have revealed the dominant role of large tyrosine residues for mediating molecular contacts and of small serine/glycine residues for providing space and flexibility. The concept of using limited residue types to construct optimized binding proteins mirrors findings in the field of small molecule drug development, where it has been proposed that most drugs are built from a limited set of side chains presented by diverse frameworks. The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it the amino acid that is most effective for mediating molecular recognition, and protein engineers have taken advantage of these characteristics to build tyrosine-rich protein binding sites that outperform natural proteins in terms of affinity and specificity. Knowledge from preceding studies can be used to improve current designs, and thus synthetic protein libraries will continue to evolve and improve. In the near future, it seems likely that synthetic binding proteins will supersede natural antibodies for most purposes, and moreover, synthetic proteins will enable many new applications beyond the scope of natural proteins."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.\n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation."

Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002)(Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams et al., 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015)."

An antibody library, a large collection of diverse, pre-constructed antibodies, can be rapidly screened using in vitro display technologies such as phage display. One of the keys to successful in vitro antibody discovery is the quality of the library diversity. Antibody diversity can be obtained either from natural B-cell sources or by the synthetic methods that combinatorially generate random nucleotide sequences. While the functionality of a natural antibody library depends largely upon the library size, various other factors can affect the quality of a synthetic antibody library, making the design and construction of synthetic antibody libraries complicated and challenging."

                "tldr": "The source of diversity significantly impacts the breadth of antibodies that can be discovered from phage display libraries. While immune libraries yield high-affinity antibodies against specific targets, na\u00efve, synthetic, and semi-synthetic libraries offer broader applicability against diverse antigens including self-antigens and toxins. (17 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe source of diversity in phage display libraries fundamentally determines the breadth of antibodies that can be discovered. This breadth refers to both the range of antigens that can be targeted and the diversity of binding specificities that can be obtained.\n\nNa\u00efve, synthetic, and semi-synthetic libraries are collectively known as \"single-pot\" libraries, offering the advantage of universal applicability against virtually any target antigen without requiring construction of new libraries for each target <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. This broad applicability extends to challenging targets that are poorly immunogenic through traditional methods, including self-antigens, highly conserved molecules, and toxic compounds <Paper corpusId=\"261608631\" paperTitle=\"(Aitken, 2008)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"270629223\" paperTitle=\"(Hutchings et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability is particularly valuable for therapeutic applications where immunological tolerance might otherwise prevent antibody generation <Paper corpusId=\"23146468\" paperTitle=\"(Nixon et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, immune libraries are inherently biased toward specific targets used for immunization, which restricts their breadth but enhances their depth for those particular targets <Paper corpusId=\"18010184\" paperTitle=\"(Bonvin et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. While this specialization limits their universal applicability, immune libraries can be particularly useful for targeted campaigns where high-affinity antibodies against specific antigens are desired <Paper corpusId=\"258334472\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor synthetic libraries, the breadth is largely determined by design choices rather than natural constraints. By precisely controlling CDR composition, synthetic libraries can theoretically target any antigen <Paper corpusId=\"11214996\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences that may affect antibody folding and function <Paper corpusId=\"18731451\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. More sophisticated synthetic approaches that mimic natural diversity patterns have been developed to address this limitation <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20994131\" paperTitle=\"(Kruif et al., 1995)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe diversity of na\u00efve libraries can be enhanced by increasing the number of donors, as individuals possess unique immune systems and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes <Paper corpusId=\"269574517\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232296539\" paperTitle=\"(Erasmus et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Interestingly, the anatomical source of B cells also impacts library breadth. A comparison between spleen and lymph node-derived libraries revealed that while immunization increased the frequency of antigen-specific binders in both organs, libraries derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice demonstrated the greatest diversity and effectiveness in generating diverse high-affinity candidates <Paper corpusId=\"34807723\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor semi-synthetic libraries, the breadth is influenced by the balance between natural and synthetic elements. These libraries can be designed to generate novel sequences that target self-antigens while avoiding the creation of highly immunogenic synthetic sequences <Paper corpusId=\"11214996\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Recent approaches have focused on creating libraries comprising natural CDR sequences purged of sequence liabilities, embedded within frameworks derived from successful therapeutic antibodies, which aims to enhance both breadth and developability <Paper corpusId=\"244774503\" paperTitle=\"(Teixeira et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMinimalist synthetic libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids (typically tyrosine and serine/glycine) in randomized CDR regions have demonstrated surprising breadth in target recognition <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17004545\" paperTitle=\"(Koide et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This finding highlights that antibody breadth can sometimes be achieved through focused diversity rather than maximizing the number of amino acids used.\n\nOverall, while the breadth of immune libraries is constrained by their target-specific nature, na\u00efve, synthetic, and semi-synthetic libraries offer broader applicability against diverse antigens, making them valuable for therapeutic discovery campaigns targeting a wide range of antigens, including challenging ones like self-antigens and toxins <Paper corpusId=\"258334472\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Antibody libraries can be constructed either by capturing naturally rearranged immunoglobulin genes isolated from B cells or using synthetic approaches relying on mutagenesis of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. In addition, semi-synthetic strategies that combine both naturally occurring and synthetic sequences have also been described (Hust et al., 2004). In most cases, na\u00efve libraries are built as universal or 'single pot' source of antibodies against any antigen. However, tailor made libraries for defined purposes have also been described. These include libraries incorporating antibody variable genes derived from immunized animals or humans that had been exposed to pathogens or vaccines, thus creating a bias towards the antigen used for immunization or the pathogen (Persson et al., 1991)(Tikunova et al., 2012). In these cases, the frequency and affinity of specific antibodies retrieved from relatively small libraries are usually much higher."

                            "There are many types of phage display libraries such as natural, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic; and they are classified by the source of their sequences (19). A natural library can be obtained from various human B-cells and are relatively similar to the natural human antibody repertoire. Immune libraries are constructed from infection-recovered humans or immunized animals and can yield high affinity binders against targets from a small sized immune library (~10 6 ). The diversity of a semi-synthetic library is increased through mutating one or more CDRs by using oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis or mixing synthetic and natural sequences (Ponsel et al., 2011)19). A synthetic library is composed of artificially designed and synthesized antibody sequences (Lee et al., 2004)21). Engineered semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries have several advantages including the use of scaffolds with highly stable properties and codon-optimized sequences with high expression levels (21, 22). Generally, immune libraries are directed towards limited number of targets. Natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic libraries can be used to isolate high affinity binders against broad antigens but are required to have very high diversity (~10 10 to 10 11 )."

With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.\n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation."

Antibodies isolated from a natural antibody library are thus generally considered more nature-like than those from a synthetic antibody library, whose diversity typically is generated by random combinatorial events. On the other hand, the greater heterogeneity of the framework regions among the clones of natural antibody libraries may result in more uneven propagation of the clones during the amplification phase of biopanning. Also, somatic hypermutations, especially in the framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that can elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response when the antibody is used as a therapeutic agent.\n\nSynthetic antibody libraries usually have one or a small number of framework sequences, upon which artificially designed and synthesized CDR sequences are grafted. The CDR diversity is mostly generated by concatenating random nucleotides [2][3][4] or trinucleotide units [5][6][7]. Various CDR design strategies have been employed to emulate natural CDRs. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences to the library."

                            "Strategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity (Barbas et al., 1991), (Vaughan et al., 1996), [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires (Barbas et al., 1992), (Barbas, 1995), (Knappik et al., 2000), (Fellouse et al., 2004). A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity (Knappik et al., 2000), (Rothe et al., 2008), (Kruif et al., 1995), (Yin et al., 2008). One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16]."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

The HCDR3 regions varied in length between 6 and 15 residues and were designed to contain fully randomized stretches of amino acid residues flanked by regions of limited residue variability that were composed of amino acid residues that frequently occur in natural antibodies. We reasoned that this approach would increase the frequency of functional molecules in our library and, in addition, permit us to efficiently utilize available cloning space. By direct selection on solid phase-bound antigens we obtained phage antibodies with binding activities to 13 different antigens, including Von Willebrand factor, the DNA-binding HMG box of transcription factor TCF-1 and the tumor antigen EGP-2. In addition, we applied a competitive selection procedure to target phage antibodies to the desired portion of a recombinant fusion protein and to select phage antibodies capable of discriminating between the two highly homologous homeobox proteins PBX1a and PBX2. The functional capacity of monoclonal phage antibodies was assessed in immuno-histochemical staining of tissue specimens. Western blotting assays and immunofluorescent analysis of cells by flow cytometry. The results demonstrate that this large human phage antibody library contains a broad assortment of binding specificities that can be applied in a variety of biochemical assays."

                            "The plasticity of natural immunoglobulin repertoires can be exploited for the generation of phage display libraries. Secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, constitute interesting sources of diversity because they are rich in B cells, part of which can be affinity matured. These organs, however, differ in their anatomical structure, reflecting the different fluids they drain, which affects the B cell repertoires. The CDRH3 repertoires from these organs, extracted from na\u00efve or immunized mice, were compared in the context of phage display libraries using human antibody framework families. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that all libraries displayed different CDRH3 repertoires, but the one derived from lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice was the most diverse. Library performance was assessed by in vitro selection. For both organs, immunization increased substantially the frequency of molecules able to bind to the immunogen. The library derived from lymph nodes from na\u00efve mice, however, was the most effective in generating diverse and high affinity candidates. These results illustrate that the use of a biased CDRH3 repertoire increases the performance of libraries, but reduces the clonal diversity, which may be detrimental for certain strategies."

Structural analyses of these minimalist binding sites have revealed the dominant role of large tyrosine residues for mediating molecular contacts and of small serine/glycine residues for providing space and flexibility. The concept of using limited residue types to construct optimized binding proteins mirrors findings in the field of small molecule drug development, where it has been proposed that most drugs are built from a limited set of side chains presented by diverse frameworks. The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it the amino acid that is most effective for mediating molecular recognition, and protein engineers have taken advantage of these characteristics to build tyrosine-rich protein binding sites that outperform natural proteins in terms of affinity and specificity. Knowledge from preceding studies can be used to improve current designs, and thus synthetic protein libraries will continue to evolve and improve. In the near future, it seems likely that synthetic binding proteins will supersede natural antibodies for most purposes, and moreover, synthetic proteins will enable many new applications beyond the scope of natural proteins."

                "tldr": "The source of diversity in phage display libraries significantly influences the developability properties of discovered antibodies. While natural libraries may contain antibodies with suboptimal biophysical characteristics, synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries can be designed with frameworks and CDRs engineered specifically to enhance expression, stability, and reduce immunogenicity. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe developability of therapeutic antibodies\u2014their ability to be manufactured, formulated, and administered as effective treatments\u2014is heavily influenced by the source of diversity in phage display libraries. This aspect has become increasingly important as the field has matured beyond focusing solely on binding affinity.\n\nNatural antibody libraries, while representing evolutionarily optimized sequences, may contain developability liabilities due to the random nature of VH/VL chain pairing that occurs during library construction <Paper corpusId=\"202024685\" paperTitle=\"(Almagro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, somatic hypermutations, especially in framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that could potentially elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) responses when used therapeutically <Paper corpusId=\"18731451\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Natural libraries derived from circulating human B lymphocytes may also be partially depleted for sequences reacting against self-antigens, potentially limiting their effectiveness for isolating antibodies targeting human proteins <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, synthetic libraries offer significant advantages for antibody developability. These libraries typically use one or a small number of framework sequences selected for their superior stability and expression characteristics <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. The framework regions are often chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have demonstrated favorable developability properties <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach reduces the heterogeneity of framework regions that can lead to uneven propagation during amplification phases of biopanning <Paper corpusId=\"18731451\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSynthetic libraries can be precisely engineered to avoid sequence liabilities that might compromise developability. For instance, they can be designed to exclude sequences that are toxic to E. coli, which improves library functionality by ensuring better display of antibodies on phage surfaces <Paper corpusId=\"58554427\" paperTitle=\"(Valadon et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, a limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized sequences may not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region, potentially reducing the number of functional members and overall performance of the library <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSemi-synthetic libraries offer a middle ground approach to developability. Some innovative semi-synthetic library designs have incorporated specific steps to enhance developability characteristics. For example, the ALTHEA Gold library incorporated a heat shock step followed by protein A recovery during construction to enhance solubility and thermostability <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This process selected for stable and well-folded antibodies, resulting in decreased frequency of hydrophobic residues in diversified CDR positions while positively selecting for charged residues <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMore recent approaches have focused on creating libraries specifically optimized for developability. Teixeira et al. hypothesized that a library comprising natural CDR sequences that have been informatically purged of sequence liabilities, embedded within frameworks derived from successful therapeutic antibodies, would facilitate the discovery of highly developable antibodies directly from the library <Paper corpusId=\"244774503\" paperTitle=\"(Teixeira et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach leverages the stringent quality control applied to antibodies during natural B-cell maturation while eliminating known problematic sequences.\n\nImmunogenicity is another critical developability concern. While synthetic libraries have allowed the development of human antibodies with reduced immunogenicity relative to humanized animal antibodies against self-antigens, the CDRs can still be immunogenic if the sequences are not naturally present in the human antibody repertoire <Paper corpusId=\"11214996\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. To address this, some approaches generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective framework regions, allowing targeting of self-antigens while preventing the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes <Paper corpusId=\"11214996\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMinimalist synthetic libraries constructed with as few as two amino acids (typically tyrosine and serine/glycine) in randomized CDR regions have demonstrated surprisingly good developability profiles <Paper corpusId=\"16251643\" paperTitle=\"(Mandrup et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17004545\" paperTitle=\"(Koide et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it particularly effective for mediating molecular recognition, while small serine/glycine residues provide space and flexibility in the binding sites <Paper corpusId=\"17004545\" paperTitle=\"(Koide et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOverall, while na\u00efve libraries have the advantage of capturing the natural repertoire of antibodies, synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries have undergone several iterations to improve their design, particularly at the HCDR3, resulting in better developability profiles <Paper corpusId=\"202024685\" paperTitle=\"(Almagro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. The quality of modern antibody libraries is now evaluated not just by their size and diversity but increasingly by their developability characteristics <Paper corpusId=\"269059585\" paperTitle=\"(Zheng et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7300202\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "One important factor in library design is the source and nature of the sequence diversity, which can originate from natural (animal B-cells), synthetic, or semi-synthetic sources.\n\nAntibody libraries from natural sources consist of antibody clones with variable regions that are the end product of V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation of germline immunoglobulin genes, all of which are presumably optimized through the evolutionary history of adaptive immunity. Antibodies isolated from a natural antibody library are thus generally considered more nature-like than those from a synthetic antibody library, whose diversity typically is generated by random combinatorial events. On the other hand, the greater heterogeneity of the framework regions among the clones of natural antibody libraries may result in more uneven propagation of the clones during the amplification phase of biopanning. Also, somatic hypermutations, especially in the framework regions, may introduce immunogenic sequences that can elicit human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response when the antibody is used as a therapeutic agent.\n\nSynthetic antibody libraries usually have one or a small number of framework sequences, upon which artificially designed and synthesized CDR sequences are grafted. The CDR diversity is mostly generated by concatenating random nucleotides [2][3][4] or trinucleotide units [5][6][7]. Various CDR design strategies have been employed to emulate natural CDRs. However, the random combinatorial nature of synthetic CDR design inevitably introduces some non-natural sequences to the library."

                            "Strategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity (Barbas et al., 1991), (Vaughan et al., 1996), [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires (Barbas et al., 1992), (Barbas, 1995), (Knappik et al., 2000), (Fellouse et al., 2004). A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity (Knappik et al., 2000), (Rothe et al., 2008), (Kruif et al., 1995), (Yin et al., 2008). One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16]."

                            "According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library.\n\nIn a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose.\n\nIn order to enhance the library solubility and thermostability, a heat shock step, followed by a protein A recovery, was incorporated in the construction of the semisynthetic ALTHEA Gold library. This is based on the observation that heat denaturation selected stable and well-folded antibodies. Validation of the library showed that the overall frequency of hydrophobic residues at diversified CDR positions decreased after heat shock and protein A selection. In contrast, charged residues were positively selected by the filtration process. By panning the library against a diverse panel of antigens, the scFvs selected exhibited high affinity (KD ranges from single-digit nM to sub-nM), solubility (>50 mg/L), and thermal stability (Tm > 70\u00b0C), which agree with biophysical parameters of therapeutic antibodies."

(Hoet et al., 2005) irst-generation phage display antibody libraries were na\u00efve. (Marks et al., 1991) Although successful, these libraries included antibody genes toxic to Escherichia coli, and thus yielded low expression levels or no expression at all, which severely compromised the number of functional antibodies displayed in the library."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

                            "While synthetic libraries have allowed the development of human antibodies with reduced immunogenicity relative to humanized animal antibodies against self-antigens, the CDRs of these libraries can also be immunogenic as often the sequences are not naturally present in the human antibody repertoire (28). With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29). While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic.\n\nOver the years, semi-synthetic and fully synthetic libraries have shown utility beyond targeting of self-antigens, as these libraries are also capable of generating antibodies of high affinity against a wide range of target antigens (16,24,25). One such high-affinity antibody which was recently approved for clinical use is raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (12). Extremely high diversity synthetic libraries have also been generated with the goal of providing higher affinity antibodies than currently approved therapeutic antibodies, thus circumventing the need for further improvement by affinity maturation."

Structural analyses of these minimalist binding sites have revealed the dominant role of large tyrosine residues for mediating molecular contacts and of small serine/glycine residues for providing space and flexibility. The concept of using limited residue types to construct optimized binding proteins mirrors findings in the field of small molecule drug development, where it has been proposed that most drugs are built from a limited set of side chains presented by diverse frameworks. The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it the amino acid that is most effective for mediating molecular recognition, and protein engineers have taken advantage of these characteristics to build tyrosine-rich protein binding sites that outperform natural proteins in terms of affinity and specificity. Knowledge from preceding studies can be used to improve current designs, and thus synthetic protein libraries will continue to evolve and improve. In the near future, it seems likely that synthetic binding proteins will supersede natural antibodies for most purposes, and moreover, synthetic proteins will enable many new applications beyond the scope of natural proteins."

Natural antibody libraries were genetically derived from B-lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, spleen and tonsils in humans or animals. The advantages of natural antibody libraries included the availability of human antibodies, targeting of all natural antigens, large enough libraries for direct access to high-affinity antibodies. But also it had more disadvantages, such as less library capacity than semi-synthetic and synthetic antibody libraries, time-consuming and laborious to build (Lennard, 2002)(Mahdavi et al., 2022). Semi-synthetic antibody libraries, which were mainly based on the framework region of natural antibody libraries. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can be randomized and the length diversity can be changed to increase the capacity of the library, and some designers had randomized all six CDR regions to achieve a diversity of up to 10 8 (Zhou et al., 2011). Synthetic antibody libraries, which were purely synthetic antibody libraries based on antibody gene libraries information. Fully synthetic antibody libraries required in-depth knowledge of the CDR regions of the antibodies, retaining the common or backbone part of the CDR regions, and designing replaceable gene regions to achieve a high degree of randomization. This created a huge library capacity (Adams et al., 2014). Antibody libraries with large capacity and rich diversity were easier to screen for ideal antibodies, so the quality of antibody libraries was generally evaluated by the two parameters of capacity and diversity (Shim, 2015)."

(11 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhen comparing the performance of different phage display libraries, antibody affinity is one of the most critical metrics. Immune libraries consistently demonstrate superior affinity for their target antigens compared to other library types. Due to natural affinity maturation processes that occur during immunization or infection, antibodies from immune libraries typically exhibit higher binding affinities than those from synthetic or na\u00efve libraries <Paper corpusId=\"267401259\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This advantage allows immune libraries to yield high-affinity binders from relatively modest-sized libraries (approximately 10^6 members) <Paper corpusId=\"258334472\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, na\u00efve libraries typically produce antibodies with lower initial affinities since these antibodies have not undergone in vivo affinity maturation <Paper corpusId=\"3889492\" paperTitle=\"(Chan et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, large na\u00efve libraries can achieve impressive performance when scaled appropriately. The CAT2.0 na\u00efve library, for example, has demonstrated the ability to yield antibodies in the picomolar affinity range, comparable to what can be achieved with well-designed synthetic libraries <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries, affinity performance is largely dependent on library size and design quality. Moderate-sized synthetic libraries have produced antibodies with monovalent affinities in the nanomolar range (10 nM), while large semi-synthetic libraries have achieved the sub-nanomolar range <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. The fully synthetic HuCAL PLATINUM\u00ae library has yielded antibodies in the lower picomolar range, demonstrating that with sufficient diversity and proper design, synthetic approaches can match the affinity performance of immune libraries <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA critical consideration when comparing library types is the diversity requirements needed to achieve high-affinity antibodies. While immune libraries can yield high-affinity binders from relatively small libraries, na\u00efve, synthetic, and semi-synthetic libraries generally require very high diversity\u2014typically in the range of 10^10 to 10^11 members\u2014to allow isolation of comparable high-affinity binders <Paper corpusId=\"258334472\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This represents a significant practical challenge in library construction and maintenance.\n\nThe design of synthetic diversity has evolved considerably over time. Early synthetic libraries faced limitations due to the random combinatorial nature of CDR diversification, where a significant proportion of randomized sequences would not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region, reducing the number of functional members and overall performance <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. More sophisticated approaches have since emerged that mimic natural diversity patterns, improving functional yield <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15340484\" paperTitle=\"(Knappik et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20994131\" paperTitle=\"(Kruif et al., 1995)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, some minimalist synthetic libraries constructed with as few as four amino acids (tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and serine) in randomized CDR regions have demonstrated high-affinity binding, with affinities in the nanomolar range <Paper corpusId=\"14660425\" paperTitle=\"(Venet et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"37419140\" paperTitle=\"(Fellouse et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that highly functional antibodies can be generated with relatively restricted amino acid diversity when the design is optimal.\n\nSemi-synthetic libraries have shown particularly promising performance profiles in recent years. The ALTHEA Gold library, which incorporated a heat shock step followed by protein A recovery during construction to enhance solubility and thermostability, produced antibodies with both high affinity (KD ranging from single-digit nM to sub-nM) and excellent biophysical properties <Paper corpusId=\"258863772\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach demonstrates how strategic selection pressure during library construction can improve not just affinity but overall antibody performance.\n\nThe evolution of library design has shifted focus from maximizing affinity alone to optimizing multiple performance parameters simultaneously. While early efforts concentrated primarily on affinity and thus on library size and diversity, subsequent developments have increasingly emphasized developability, production characteristics, and biophysical behavior <Paper corpusId=\"10576257\" paperTitle=\"(Ponsel et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"202024685\" paperTitle=\"(Almagro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This evolution reflects the maturing understanding that therapeutic antibody development requires optimization across multiple performance dimensions simultaneously.\n\nFor therapeutic applications, the performance differences between library types may be less significant than their practical implications. Single large na\u00efve, synthetic, or semi-synthetic libraries have been shown capable of producing high-affinity antibodies (Kd < 10nM) to a wide range of structurally diverse antigens, eliminating the need for specific libraries for each antigen <Paper corpusId=\"23146468\" paperTitle=\"(Nixon et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This practical advantage, combined with the ability to circumvent issues with immunological tolerance found in mouse immunization approaches, makes these \"single-pot\" libraries particularly valuable for therapeutic antibody discovery despite their higher diversity requirements.",

                            "There are many types of phage display libraries such as natural, immune, semi-synthetic and synthetic; and they are classified by the source of their sequences (19). A natural library can be obtained from various human B-cells and are relatively similar to the natural human antibody repertoire. Immune libraries are constructed from infection-recovered humans or immunized animals and can yield high affinity binders against targets from a small sized immune library (~10 6 ). The diversity of a semi-synthetic library is increased through mutating one or more CDRs by using oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis or mixing synthetic and natural sequences (Ponsel et al., 2011)19). A synthetic library is composed of artificially designed and synthesized antibody sequences (Lee et al., 2004)21). Engineered semi-synthetic and synthetic libraries have several advantages including the use of scaffolds with highly stable properties and codon-optimized sequences with high expression levels (21, 22). Generally, immune libraries are directed towards limited number of targets. Natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic libraries can be used to isolate high affinity binders against broad antigens but are required to have very high diversity (~10 10 to 10 11 )."

                            "Strategies for generating naive antibody repertoires -or libraries -capture different sources of diversity. In many cases, naturally rearranged antibody variable genes from animal or human donors are assembled to generate libraries based on natural diversity (Barbas et al., 1991), (Vaughan et al., 1996), [8]. Alternatively, synthetic libraries are generated by introducing random diversity into the complementary determining regions (CDR) of specific antibody frameworks, the latter selected for stability and high frequency representation in human repertoires (Barbas et al., 1992), (Barbas, 1995), (Knappik et al., 2000), (Fellouse et al., 2004). A limitation of synthetic CDR diversification is that a significant proportion of randomized CDR sequences do not allow proper folding of the antibody variable region and, thus, reduce the number of functional members and overall performance of the library. This limitation can be partially mitigated by synthetic approaches where CDR sequences are designed to mimic natural diversity (Knappik et al., 2000), (Rothe et al., 2008), (Kruif et al., 1995), (Yin et al., 2008). One advantage of libraries based on naturally occurring sequences is that they include amino acid stretches in the CDR3 of the heavy chain (CDRH3) which are difficult to obtain with synthetic approaches. However, these libraries also contain variable domains that are less stable or under-represented in human repertoires. Both characteristics can increase the risk of being immunogenic and are, therefore, not desirable for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Another drawback of natural libraries that are based on variable genes, retrieved from circulating human B lymphocytes, is that these repertoires have been partially depleted for sequences reacting against self antigens and thus can be less effective for the isolation of antibodies targeting human proteins [16]."

                            "By analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure, amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage, we found that seven V(H) and seven V(L) (four Vkappa and three Vlambda) germline families cover more than 95 % of the human antibody diversity used. A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2x10(9) members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the V(H) and V(L) CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes."

The HCDR3 regions varied in length between 6 and 15 residues and were designed to contain fully randomized stretches of amino acid residues flanked by regions of limited residue variability that were composed of amino acid residues that frequently occur in natural antibodies. We reasoned that this approach would increase the frequency of functional molecules in our library and, in addition, permit us to efficiently utilize available cloning space. By direct selection on solid phase-bound antigens we obtained phage antibodies with binding activities to 13 different antigens, including Von Willebrand factor, the DNA-binding HMG box of transcription factor TCF-1 and the tumor antigen EGP-2. In addition, we applied a competitive selection procedure to target phage antibodies to the desired portion of a recombinant fusion protein and to select phage antibodies capable of discriminating between the two highly homologous homeobox proteins PBX1a and PBX2. The functional capacity of monoclonal phage antibodies was assessed in immuno-histochemical staining of tissue specimens. Western blotting assays and immunofluorescent analysis of cells by flow cytometry. The results demonstrate that this large human phage antibody library contains a broad assortment of binding specificities that can be applied in a variety of biochemical assays."

Libraries were constructed such that solvent-accessible CDR positions were randomized with a degenerate codon that encoded for only four amino acids (tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and serine). Nonetheless, high-affinity Fabs (K(d) = 2-10 nM) were isolated against human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF), and the crystal structures were determined for two distinct Fab-hVEGF complexes. The structures revealed that antigen recognition was mediated primarily by tyrosine side chains, which accounted for 71% of the Fab surface area that became buried upon binding to hVEGF. In contrast, aspartate residues within the CDRs were almost entirely excluded from the binding interface. Alanine and serine residues did not make many direct contacts with antigen, but they allowed for space and conformational flexibility and thus played an auxiliary role in facilitating productive contacts between tyrosine and antigen. Tyrosine side chains were capable of mediating most of the contacts necessary for high-affinity antigen recognition, and, thus, it seems likely that the overabundance of tyrosine in natural antigen-binding sites is a consequence of the side chain being particularly well suited for making productive contacts with antigen. The findings shed light on the basic principles governing the evolution of natural immune repertoires and should also aid the development of improved synthetic antibody libraries."

                            "According to source of diversity, antibody phage display libraries can be categorized into three types: natural library, synthetic library, and semisynthetic library.\n\nIn a natural library, diversity is derived entirely from natural repertoires, which can be either healthy, autoimmune, or immunized donors (named na\u00efve, nonimmunized, and immunized libraries, respectively). In theory, a large na\u00efve library can be used to isolate antibodies against any targets, but, if a library is constructed from immunized donors, diversity will be highly biased toward a specific target. For an immunized library constructed from human repertoires, it can be constructed from either vaccinated donors or donors who have recovered from infection or disease. In a fully synthetic library, the antibody frameworks are usually chosen from human antibody germlines that are well-represented and have shown superior developability. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designed based on antibody structure and application purpose.\n\nIn order to enhance the library solubility and thermostability, a heat shock step, followed by a protein A recovery, was incorporated in the construction of the semisynthetic ALTHEA Gold library. This is based on the observation that heat denaturation selected stable and well-folded antibodies. Validation of the library showed that the overall frequency of hydrophobic residues at diversified CDR positions decreased after heat shock and protein A selection. In contrast, charged residues were positively selected by the filtration process. By panning the library against a diverse panel of antigens, the scFvs selected exhibited high affinity (KD ranges from single-digit nM to sub-nM), solubility (>50 mg/L), and thermal stability (Tm > 70\u00b0C), which agree with biophysical parameters of therapeutic antibodies."

                            "Sources of diversity for phage display libraries includes immunized and na\u00efve, i.e., non-immunized, animals, as well as synthetic diversity. Use of immunized animals as a source of diversity can be attractive in that the resulting library will be biased toward the target of interest and should contain high-affinity antibodies that have been matured through the natural affinity maturation process. This approach, however, requires construction of new libraries for each new antigen and assumes that an immune response can be generated to the antigen of interest. Alternatively, single large na\u00efve, 13 synthetic, 14,15 or semi-synthetic libraries (where synthetic diversity is combined with natural diversity) 12 have been shown to be capable of producing high affinity antibodies (K d < 10nM) to a wide range of structurally diverse antigens. The use of such libraries therefore eliminates the need for a specific library for a specific antigen and circumvents issues with immunological tolerance found with mouse immunization approaches."
