            "abstract": "Simple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.",

Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

They usually consist of dipeptides cleavable by lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, typically abundant in cancer cells.

Engelholm\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.\n## The Linker-A Balancing Bridge\nThe subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50]. \n\nConceived as an alternative strategy to chemically labile linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers have reached clinical success in precise drug release [2,25,32,43,44]. They usually consist of dipeptides cleavable by lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, typically abundant in cancer cells. Nine of the approved ADCs include enzyme-labile linkers, mostly based on the well-established cathepsin-sensitive valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) dipeptide, used to construct the chimeric anti-CD30 antibody-MMAE conjugate, or brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris \u00ae ). Alternative cathepsin-responsive dipeptides usually employed in ADC design are alaninealanine (Ala-Ala), phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), or valine-alanine (Val-Ala) sequences. Other common protease-activated linkers targeting lysosomal enzymes rather than cathep-sins include \u03b2-Galactosidaseor \u03b2-glucuronidase cleavable linkers [2,25,32,43,44]. Usually, due to the bulky nature of the payload, a para-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) selfimmolating spacer is also included in the linker moiety to facilitate enzyme access to the cleavage site. This unit further increases linker stability and allows straightforward payload release thanks to its self-cleavage capacity. Accordingly, enzyme-sensitive linkers provide a more precise release of the drug in the tumor milieu while also offering enhanced systemic stability than the chemical labile type due to their inertia at physiological conditions and protection by serum protease inhibitors [2,25,32,43,44].\n...\nDue to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].\n...\nOther recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43]. Paralleling the efforts in improving ADCs pharmacology is the expanding development of site-specific linkers and conjugation technologies, which allow for homogeneous constructs with superior therapeutic indices [32,43], as described in the following section.",

                    "text": "The immense research effort put into ADC linker-payload design during the past decade has contributed to a sharp increase in regulatory approvals. However, ADC development still faces dose-limiting toxicity issues during clinical trials, which could be partly attributed to the systemic release of the payload and poor PK properties. The development of more stable linker systems in mouse and rat plasma would accelerate the preclinical evaluation of the ADC drug candidates. In particular, the identification of new peptide/peptidomimetic sequences will allow highly specific cleavage, which can greatly reduce premature cleavage of the linker at non-tumor sites, hence increasing the safety profiles of the ADCs. Obviously, the linker systems reviewed herein apply only to typical ADCs which rely on binding to an internalizing antigen and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the payload via lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless, recent years have also seen growing interest in developing an atypical class of ADCs targeting poorlyor non-internalizing antigens on cancer cells or components of surrounding tumor stroma. For these ADCs, the linkers are cleaved extracellularly within the tumor microenvironment to release the payload, which can then diffuse into nearby cancer cells for selective killing. However, the design of such linker systems is beyond the scope of the current review. The readers are advised to refer to an excellent recent review article by Ashman et al. for a comprehensive account on this topic [55]. In addition to linker design, site-specific conjugation using engineered antibodies and enzyme systems now enables the development of homogeneous ADCs with superior PK properties. The use of a site-specific conjugation method also allows for payload attachment at sites that can enhance systemic stability of the prepared ADCs. The use of improved linker-payload designs and highly active payloads in combination with site-specific conjugation chemistry will lead to more successes in the ADC field in the future.",

Balamkundu, Chuan-Fa Liu\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a powerful therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. ADCs are multi-functional biologics in which a disease-targeting antibody is conjugated to an effector payload molecule via a linker. The success of currently used ADCs has been largely attributed to the development of linker systems, which allow for the targeted release of cytocidal payload drugs inside cancer cells. Many lysosomal proteases are over expressed in human cancers. They can effectively cleave a variety of peptide sequences, which can be exploited for the design of ADC linker systems. As a well-established linker, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is used in many ADCs that are already approved or under preclinical and clinical development. Although ValCitPABC and related linkers are readily cleaved by cathepsins in the lysosome while remaining reasonably stable in human plasma, many studies have shown that they are susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma, which hinders the preclinical evaluation of ADCs. Furthermore, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, two of the most commonly observed dose-limiting adverse effects of ADCs, are believed to result from the premature hydrolysis of ValCitPABC by human neutrophil elastase. In addition to ValCitPABC, the GGFG tetrapeptidyl-aminomethoxy linker is also cathepsin-cleavable and is used in the highly successful ADC drug, DS8201a. In addition to cathepsin-cleavable linkers, there is also growing interest in legumain-sensitive linkers for ADC development. Increasing plasma stability while maintaining lysosomal cleavability of ADC linkers is an objective of intensive current research. This review reports recent advances in the design and structure\u2013activity relationship studies of various peptide/peptidomimetic linkers in this field.\n## Introduction\nClinical approvals of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have seen a big leap in the past several years. In fact, 12 out of 15 ADCs on the market were approved from 2017 to 2022 [1,2]. More than 100 new ADCs are currently at various stages of clinical development, which reflects the huge potential of this class of medicines in cancer treatment. The mechanism of action of ADCs involves antibody binding to a specific antigen on cancerous cells and subsequent internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cancer cell, degradation of the antibody and/or cleavage of the linker in the endosomal-lysosomal compartments would release the drug payload, which then exerts its cytocidal effects in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Researchers have taken advantage of two important endosomal-lysosomal features in designing linker systems for drug release: (i) the acidic environment inside lysosomes for the design of acid-labile linkers, and (ii) the over-expression of specific lysosomal proteases for the design of protease-cleavable linkers (Figure 1A) [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Eight out of the fifteen approved ADCs have protease-recognizable peptide sequences in the linkers (Table 1), which are further attached to a self-immolated moiety. Upon cleavage of the peptide sequence by the protease, the self-immolated moiety peptide sequences in the linkers (Table 1), which are further attached to a self-immolate moiety. Upon cleavage of the peptide sequence by the protease, the self-immolated moiet readily undergoes elimination to release the free drug, which then defuses out of the ly sosomal compartment. Linker-payload optimization is one of the most critical tasks i ADC development.\n\n## Conclusions and Outlook\nThe immense research effort put into ADC linker-payload design during the past decade has contributed to a sharp increase in regulatory approvals. However, ADC development still faces dose-limiting toxicity issues during clinical trials, which could be partly attributed to the systemic release of the payload and poor PK properties. The development of more stable linker systems in mouse and rat plasma would accelerate the preclinical evaluation of the ADC drug candidates. In particular, the identification of new peptide/peptidomimetic sequences will allow highly specific cleavage, which can greatly reduce premature cleavage of the linker at non-tumor sites, hence increasing the safety profiles of the ADCs. Obviously, the linker systems reviewed herein apply only to typical ADCs which rely on binding to an internalizing antigen and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the payload via lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless, recent years have also seen growing interest in developing an atypical class of ADCs targeting poorlyor non-internalizing antigens on cancer cells or components of surrounding tumor stroma. For these ADCs, the linkers are cleaved extracellularly within the tumor microenvironment to release the payload, which can then diffuse into nearby cancer cells for selective killing. However, the design of such linker systems is beyond the scope of the current review. The readers are advised to refer to an excellent recent review article by Ashman et al. for a comprehensive account on this topic [55]. In addition to linker design, site-specific conjugation using engineered antibodies and enzyme systems now enables the development of homogeneous ADCs with superior PK properties. The use of a site-specific conjugation method also allows for payload attachment at sites that can enhance systemic stability of the prepared ADCs. The use of improved linker-payload designs and highly active payloads in combination with site-specific conjugation chemistry will lead to more successes in the ADC field in the future.",

However, payload instability, hydrophobicity, and premature cleavage limit their efficacy and safety. This study presents Exo-Linker technology as a novel solution to these issues. By repositioning cleavable peptide linkers like Glu-Val-Cit and Glu-Glu-Val-Cit at the exo-position of the p-aminobenzyl carbamate moiety, Exo-Linkers improve stability, hydrophilicity, and resistance to enzymatic degradation.\n\nKey findings highlight the superior pharmacokinetics, tumor-suppressive efficacy, and enzymatic stability of Exo-Linker ADCs in preclinical models, significantly outperforming traditional Val-Cit-based linkers. Integration with the second-generation AJICAP platform broadens therapeutic windows, ensures precise drug-to-antibody ratio control, and minimizes aggregation. Exo-Linkers establish a new standard for ADC development, overcoming critical limitations of traditional linkers while enabling safer and more effective cancer treatments. This innovative approach redefines the therapeutic landscape, enhances patient outcomes, and broadens the scope of ADC applications.\n",

Considering the cytotoxicity of the payload and bystander effect, cleavable linkers are prioritized in ADC development, despite a few approved noncleavable effective linkers. \n\nIn recent decades, significant progress has been made in optimizing the structure and expanding the mechanisms of ADCs. 0][61] These novel cleavable linkers have shown increased selectivity for targeting tumors. Among them, cathepsin, glutathione, and acid-cleavable linkers have been extensively researched and incorporated into approved ADCs. 58,62 Notably, phosphatase-responsive and bioorthogonal cleavable linkers have the potential to overcome intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs. 51,63 Early data on these new linkers are promising and are expected to significantly advance the development of ADC drugs in the future.",

While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

                    "text": "Despite the significant development of drugs along with the novel treatment methods available in clinical cancer therapy, the prevalence of cancer still remains to be a formidable challenge, and huge obstacles are there to be solved. The increasing risk of toxicity on patients and limited therapeutic window are the major problems in the current chemotherapies. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in order to effectively address these issues. \n\nDrug conjugate or prodrug is one of the most successful approaches for these strategies, using various linkers to mask the activity of the drug and connect with drug carrier and targeting agents, which effectively increase the selectivity of the drugs and, very importantly, improve the ADME properties to subtly circumvent all sorts of difficulties of the complex biological system to deliver the potent payload at the right place and at the right time. Linker, as its name implies, is the structural hub for assembly of the other essential components for becoming a complete pro-drug and also plays a significant role in practice to release the payload. \n\nIn recent years, photocleavable linkers have been developed as a non-invasive technology, allowing the controlled release of the active substance with high spatiotemporal precision. Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies. This orthogonal release approach, which has demonstrated its potential from previous applications, will be further explored in future research.",

The drug is attached to the carrier by a linker through covalent conjugation to render it inactive during circulation (Figure 1). Then, the drug is released through decomposition of the linker by either external or internal stimuli after reaching the tumor microenvironment. As seen in Figure 1, the carrier can have significant influences on the pharmacokinetic properties and may act as a targeting agent to reduce the off-target toxicity of the drug conjugates. There are many substrates that are eligible to be the carriers of the drug, for example, monoclonal antibodies (mAb), dendrimers, small ligands, polymers, nanoparticles, peptides, and many more [6]. On the other hand, the linker plays a determinant role in the drug conjugate cleavage, as well as affecting the stability, hydrophilicity, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of the overall drug molecule [7]. \n\nThere are two types of linkers developed so far, different in where the stimuli for the cleavage triggering mechanism are from. The internal trigger of the first type of linker takes advantage of the difference in systemic conditions between the normal tissue and the tumor microenvironment. For example, an acid-sensitive hydrazone linker becomes cleavable in the tumor tissue because of the lower pH condition, and enzyme cleavable, dipeptide, and disulfide linkers are susceptible to the overpresence of trigger enzymes such as cathepsin and glutathione (GSH) in the tumor environment. Although extensive progress has been made on internal trigger strategy, moderate stability and off-target release of the drug still restrict their therapeutic index due to the non-specific presence of the trigger in the non-target environment. Additionally, varying chemical environments between patients and lack of artificial control post-administration also become one of the main problems of this linker strategy. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in utilizing external triggers in drug delivery systems.",

On the other hand, the linker plays a determinant role in the drug conjugate cleavage, as well as affecting the stability, hydrophilicity, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of the overall drug molecule [7]. \n\nThere are two types of linkers developed so far, different in where the stimuli for the cleavage triggering mechanism are from. The internal trigger of the first type of linker takes advantage of the difference in systemic conditions between the normal tissue and the tumor microenvironment. For example, an acid-sensitive hydrazone linker becomes cleavable in the tumor tissue because of the lower pH condition, and enzyme cleavable, dipeptide, and disulfide linkers are susceptible to the overpresence of trigger enzymes such as cathepsin and glutathione (GSH) in the tumor environment. Although extensive progress has been made on internal trigger strategy, moderate stability and off-target release of the drug still restrict their therapeutic index due to the non-specific presence of the trigger in the non-target environment. Additionally, varying chemical environments between patients and lack of artificial control post-administration also become one of the main problems of this linker strategy. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in utilizing external triggers in drug delivery systems.\n\n## Conclusions\nDespite the significant development of drugs along with the novel treatment methods available in clinical cancer therapy, the prevalence of cancer still remains to be a formidable challenge, and huge obstacles are there to be solved. The increasing risk of toxicity on patients and limited therapeutic window are the major problems in the current chemotherapies. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in order to effectively address these issues. \n\nDrug conjugate or prodrug is one of the most successful approaches for these strategies, using various linkers to mask the activity of the drug and connect with drug carrier and targeting agents, which effectively increase the selectivity of the drugs and, very importantly, improve the ADME properties to subtly circumvent all sorts of difficulties of the complex biological system to deliver the potent payload at the right place and at the right time. Linker, as its name implies, is the structural hub for assembly of the other essential components for becoming a complete pro-drug and also plays a significant role in practice to release the payload. \n\nIn recent years, photocleavable linkers have been developed as a non-invasive technology, allowing the controlled release of the active substance with high spatiotemporal precision. Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies. This orthogonal release approach, which has demonstrated its potential from previous applications, will be further explored in future research.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Targeted payload delivery strategies, such as antibody\u2010drug conjugates (ADCs), have emerged as important therapeutics. Although considerable efforts have been made in the areas of antibody engineering and labeling methodology, improving the overall physicochemical properties of the linker/payload combination remains an important challenge. Here we report an approach to create an intrinsically hydrophilic linker domain. We find that benzyl \u03b1\u2010ammonium carbamates (BACs) undergo tandem 1,6\u20131,2\u2010elimination to release secondary amines. Using a fluorogenic hemicyanine as a model payload component, we show that a zwitterionic BAC linker improves labeling efficiency and reduces antibody aggregation when compared to a commonly used para\u2010amino benzyl (PAB) linker as well as a cationic BAC. Cellular and in vivo fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the model payload is specifically released in antigen\u2010expressing cells and tumors. The therapeutic potential of the BAC linker strategy was assessed using an MMAE payload, a potent microtubule\u2010disrupting agent frequently used for ADC applications. The BAC\u2010MMAE combination enhances labeling efficiency and cellular toxicity when compared to the routinely used PAB\u2010Val\u2010Cit ADC analogue. Broadly, this strategy provides a general approach to mask payload hydrophobicity and improve the properties of targeted agents.",

                    "text": "Targeted drug delivery strategies combine a targeting agent and a payload molecule through a cleavable linker. [1,2] [5] The success of an ADC depends on the careful selection of appropriate payloads, optimization of antibody characteristics, and the use of linkers that cleave only after target engagement. [6,7] 10] An appealing strategy is to engineer the linker domain to improve the overall physical properties of the ADC. \n\nExisting linkers often rely on the self-immolative paraamino benzyl (PAB) spacer unit, which was first introduced for biological applications by Katzenellenbogen in 1981. [11] ased on an efficient and general 1,6-elimination (Figure 1A), this approach has been widely used to create cleavable linkers that respond to various stimuli. [12] 20][21][22][23] A critical insight to emerge from these studies is that charged, but net neutral (i.e. zwitterionic) functional groups can effectively shield the hydrophobicity of the payload and improve in vivo targeting performance. We hypothesize that suitable chemistry could introduce otherwise hydrophobic payloads onto targeting mAbs without compromising the properties of the parent antibody. While several efforts have looked at pegylation strategies, [9,[24][25][26][27] no approaches that incorporate zwitterionic linker domains have been developed. \n\nHerein, we detail a cleavable zwitterionic linker strategy utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads. [28,29] [32] In this work, we fuse these two fundamental chemistries such that upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination unveils a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2elimination to release the payload (Figure 1B). \n\nA feature of the BAC strategy is that the cleavage site is independent from the conjugation chemistry.",

Patel, J. Kalen, M. Schnermann\n## Abstract\nAbstract Targeted payload delivery strategies, such as antibody\u2010drug conjugates (ADCs), have emerged as important therapeutics. Although considerable efforts have been made in the areas of antibody engineering and labeling methodology, improving the overall physicochemical properties of the linker/payload combination remains an important challenge. Here we report an approach to create an intrinsically hydrophilic linker domain. We find that benzyl \u03b1\u2010ammonium carbamates (BACs) undergo tandem 1,6\u20131,2\u2010elimination to release secondary amines. Using a fluorogenic hemicyanine as a model payload component, we show that a zwitterionic BAC linker improves labeling efficiency and reduces antibody aggregation when compared to a commonly used para\u2010amino benzyl (PAB) linker as well as a cationic BAC. Cellular and in vivo fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the model payload is specifically released in antigen\u2010expressing cells and tumors. The therapeutic potential of the BAC linker strategy was assessed using an MMAE payload, a potent microtubule\u2010disrupting agent frequently used for ADC applications. The BAC\u2010MMAE combination enhances labeling efficiency and cellular toxicity when compared to the routinely used PAB\u2010Val\u2010Cit ADC analogue. Broadly, this strategy provides a general approach to mask payload hydrophobicity and improve the properties of targeted agents.\n## body\nTargeted drug delivery strategies combine a targeting agent and a payload molecule through a cleavable linker. [1,2] [5] The success of an ADC depends on the careful selection of appropriate payloads, optimization of antibody characteristics, and the use of linkers that cleave only after target engagement. [6,7] 10] An appealing strategy is to engineer the linker domain to improve the overall physical properties of the ADC. \n\nExisting linkers often rely on the self-immolative paraamino benzyl (PAB) spacer unit, which was first introduced for biological applications by Katzenellenbogen in 1981. [11] ased on an efficient and general 1,6-elimination (Figure 1A), this approach has been widely used to create cleavable linkers that respond to various stimuli. [12] 20][21][22][23] A critical insight to emerge from these studies is that charged, but net neutral (i.e. zwitterionic) functional groups can effectively shield the hydrophobicity of the payload and improve in vivo targeting performance. We hypothesize that suitable chemistry could introduce otherwise hydrophobic payloads onto targeting mAbs without compromising the properties of the parent antibody. While several efforts have looked at pegylation strategies, [9,[24][25][26][27] no approaches that incorporate zwitterionic linker domains have been developed. \n\nHerein, we detail a cleavable zwitterionic linker strategy utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads. [28,29] [32] In this work, we fuse these two fundamental chemistries such that upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination unveils a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2elimination to release the payload (Figure 1B). \n\nA feature of the BAC strategy is that the cleavage site is independent from the conjugation chemistry.\n...\nFPLC analysis showed that both ADCs formed neglectable aggregates (Figure S20). We also carried out an in vitro cleavable assay and found that cathepsin  5D) and demonstrated lower off-target toxicity in EGFR-negative MCF-7 cell lines (Figure 5E). These results suggest that the BAC linkers can improve mAb labeling efficiency, improve potency, and reduce cellular off-target uptake. \n\nIn summary, a new cleavable ADC linker strategy has been developed utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1-ammonium carbamates. We demonstrate that this linker enhances yield/labeling density while mitigating the formation of aggregated conjugates when compared to PAB strategies.

            "abstract": "The recent setbacks in the withdrawal and approval delays of antibody treatments of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), attributed to their poor entry across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), emphasize the need to bring novel approaches to enhance the entry across the BBB. One such approach is conjugating the antibodies that bind brain proteins responsible for NDs with the transferrin molecule. This glycoprotein transports iron into cells, connecting with the transferrin receptors (TfRs), piggybacking an antibody\u2013transferrin complex that can subsequently release the antibody in the brain or stay connected while letting the antibody bind. This process increases the concentration of antibodies in the brain, enhancing therapeutic efficacy with targeted delivery and minimum systemic side effects. Currently, this approach is experimented with using drug-transferring conjugates assembled in vitro. Still, a more efficient and safer alternative is to express the conjugate using mRNA technology, as detailed in this paper. This approach will expedite safer discoveries that can be made available at a much lower cost than the recombinant process with in vitro conjugation. Most importantly, the recommendations made in this paper may save the antibodies against the NDs that seem to be failing despite their regulatory approvals.",

                    "text": "Several considerations must be considered when selecting a linker to bind an antibody to transferrin to facilitate entry into the brain. First and foremost, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which molecules, including antibodies, can cross the BBB [73]. TfRs are one of the targets for transporting molecules across the BBB. Therefore, conjugating antibodies to transferrin can facilitate brain entry via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Secondly, the linker should be designed to be stable during circulation but cleavable in the brain milieu to release the antibody from transferrin. Various cleavable linkers, such as protease-sensitive or pH-sensitive linkers, can be considered [52,74]. Thirdly, the linker should maintain stability in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the antibodytransferrin conjugate. Stability can be influenced by factors such as serum proteases and pH [75]. \n\nAdditionally, the linker should be designed to be cleavable within the unique microenvironment of the BBB, which may have different enzymatic activities or pH compared to other tissues [76]. Once a linker design is proposed, it is crucial to validate its efficacy in facilitating brain entry and cleavage in preclinical models [77]. Optimization may be necessary to achieve the desired pharmacokinetics and brain distribution. Finally, assessing the safety profile of the linker and ensuring the specificity of brain targeting are important considerations to minimize off-target effects and potential toxicity [73]. \n\nThe pH-sensitive linkers play a crucial role in drug delivery systems, as they are designed to remain stable at physiological pH but become cleavable under acidic conditions typically found in endosomes or lysosomes. One example is hydrazone linkers, which form via the reaction between a hydrazide and a carbonyl group under acidic conditions. They exhibit stability at neutral pH but undergo hydrolysis in acidic environments, facilitating linker cleavage. This mechanism has been utilized in various drug delivery systems, including liposomes and polymer conjugates [78]. Another commonly used pH-sensitive linker is the acetal linker, which remains stable at neutral pH but undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to release the payload under acidic conditions.",

Niazi, Matthias Magoola\n## Abstract\nThe recent setbacks in the withdrawal and approval delays of antibody treatments of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), attributed to their poor entry across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), emphasize the need to bring novel approaches to enhance the entry across the BBB. One such approach is conjugating the antibodies that bind brain proteins responsible for NDs with the transferrin molecule. This glycoprotein transports iron into cells, connecting with the transferrin receptors (TfRs), piggybacking an antibody\u2013transferrin complex that can subsequently release the antibody in the brain or stay connected while letting the antibody bind. This process increases the concentration of antibodies in the brain, enhancing therapeutic efficacy with targeted delivery and minimum systemic side effects. Currently, this approach is experimented with using drug-transferring conjugates assembled in vitro. Still, a more efficient and safer alternative is to express the conjugate using mRNA technology, as detailed in this paper. This approach will expedite safer discoveries that can be made available at a much lower cost than the recombinant process with in vitro conjugation. Most importantly, the recommendations made in this paper may save the antibodies against the NDs that seem to be failing despite their regulatory approvals.\n## Linkers\nSeveral considerations must be considered when selecting a linker to bind an antibody to transferrin to facilitate entry into the brain. First and foremost, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which molecules, including antibodies, can cross the BBB [73]. TfRs are one of the targets for transporting molecules across the BBB. Therefore, conjugating antibodies to transferrin can facilitate brain entry via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Secondly, the linker should be designed to be stable during circulation but cleavable in the brain milieu to release the antibody from transferrin. Various cleavable linkers, such as protease-sensitive or pH-sensitive linkers, can be considered [52,74]. Thirdly, the linker should maintain stability in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the antibodytransferrin conjugate. Stability can be influenced by factors such as serum proteases and pH [75]. \n\nAdditionally, the linker should be designed to be cleavable within the unique microenvironment of the BBB, which may have different enzymatic activities or pH compared to other tissues [76]. Once a linker design is proposed, it is crucial to validate its efficacy in facilitating brain entry and cleavage in preclinical models [77]. Optimization may be necessary to achieve the desired pharmacokinetics and brain distribution. Finally, assessing the safety profile of the linker and ensuring the specificity of brain targeting are important considerations to minimize off-target effects and potential toxicity [73]. \n\nThe pH-sensitive linkers play a crucial role in drug delivery systems, as they are designed to remain stable at physiological pH but become cleavable under acidic conditions typically found in endosomes or lysosomes. One example is hydrazone linkers, which form via the reaction between a hydrazide and a carbonyl group under acidic conditions. They exhibit stability at neutral pH but undergo hydrolysis in acidic environments, facilitating linker cleavage. This mechanism has been utilized in various drug delivery systems, including liposomes and polymer conjugates [78]. Another commonly used pH-sensitive linker is the acetal linker, which remains stable at neutral pH but undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to release the payload under acidic conditions.",

Currently, there are 12 FDA-approved ADCs, eight of which have been approved within the last five years, with numerous candidates in clinical trials. The promising clinical perspective of ADCs has led to the development of not only novel conjugation techniques, but also antibody formats, linkers, and payloads. While the majority of currently approved ADCs relies on cytotoxic small molecule warheads, alternative modes of action imparted by novel payloads and non-classical antibody formats are gaining attention. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art of ADC technologies, as well as comprehensively examine alternative payloads, such as toxic proteins, cytokines, PROTACs and oligonucleotides, and highlight the potential of multi-specific antibody formats for the next generation of therapeutic antibody conjugates.",

                    "text": "Before we move towards the various cargos that are being explored for ADCs, we will briefly summarize recent advances in conjugation techniques and linker designs. Both aspects play a key role in ADC stability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic [58,59]. Relevant parameters for the conjugation strategy are the site-of-attachment, the drug-to-antibody ratio and stability in biological matrices (Fig. 3). While stability is an important design feature of linkers, further aspects like solubility, release mechanisms and multivalency are being considered as relevant for the potency and safety of ADCs. In this section we highlight how researchers have implemented these features in recently developed conjugation methods and linker designs. For a comprehensive overview of site-selective modification strategies for ADCs we would like to bring your attention to a very recent review by Walsh et al. [60] and a detailed and comprehensive review of cleavable linkers can be found in a 2019 review by Bargh et al. [61]. \n\nCurrently approved ADCs exclusively use amine-or thiol-directed conjugation for drug attachment. In these cases, drugs are attached to surface exposed lysine residues or reduced intrachain-disulfides, respectively. By targeting endogenous residues, no engineering of the antibody is necessary. However, the site of attachment and the number of attached molecules is hard to control, leading to a heterogenous product containing multiple ADC species of varying DARs. Furthermore, cysteine conjugation via maleimides poses the risk for hydrolysis and thiolexchange to endogenous proteins in biological matrices [62,63]. These aspects are considered to negatively affect the potency and safety of the conjugates [63][64][65].",

Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

Stengl\n## Abstract\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are rapidly becoming a cornerstone in targeted therapies, especially for the treatment of cancer. Currently, there are 12 FDA-approved ADCs, eight of which have been approved within the last five years, with numerous candidates in clinical trials. The promising clinical perspective of ADCs has led to the development of not only novel conjugation techniques, but also antibody formats, linkers, and payloads. While the majority of currently approved ADCs relies on cytotoxic small molecule warheads, alternative modes of action imparted by novel payloads and non-classical antibody formats are gaining attention. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art of ADC technologies, as well as comprehensively examine alternative payloads, such as toxic proteins, cytokines, PROTACs and oligonucleotides, and highlight the potential of multi-specific antibody formats for the next generation of therapeutic antibody conjugates.\n## Linking up: Advances in Site-Directed Conjugation and Linker Design\nBefore we move towards the various cargos that are being explored for ADCs, we will briefly summarize recent advances in conjugation techniques and linker designs. Both aspects play a key role in ADC stability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic [58,59]. Relevant parameters for the conjugation strategy are the site-of-attachment, the drug-to-antibody ratio and stability in biological matrices (Fig. 3). While stability is an important design feature of linkers, further aspects like solubility, release mechanisms and multivalency are being considered as relevant for the potency and safety of ADCs. In this section we highlight how researchers have implemented these features in recently developed conjugation methods and linker designs. For a comprehensive overview of site-selective modification strategies for ADCs we would like to bring your attention to a very recent review by Walsh et al. [60] and a detailed and comprehensive review of cleavable linkers can be found in a 2019 review by Bargh et al. [61]. \n\nCurrently approved ADCs exclusively use amine-or thiol-directed conjugation for drug attachment. In these cases, drugs are attached to surface exposed lysine residues or reduced intrachain-disulfides, respectively. By targeting endogenous residues, no engineering of the antibody is necessary. However, the site of attachment and the number of attached molecules is hard to control, leading to a heterogenous product containing multiple ADC species of varying DARs. Furthermore, cysteine conjugation via maleimides poses the risk for hydrolysis and thiolexchange to endogenous proteins in biological matrices [62,63]. These aspects are considered to negatively affect the potency and safety of the conjugates [63][64][65].\n...\nNotably, the TTL has a broad substrate tolerance and thus allows the incorporation of a variety of bioorthogonal handles [111] for subsequent site-specific toxin-conjugation. \n\nApart from these well-established methods several more site-specific conjugation concepts, like pi-clamp [112] or CD38 domain-tag [113], and conjugation to native lysines by using affinity peptides, e.g., as guides [114,115] have been published in the context of ADC generation and are comprehensively covered elsewhere [60,116]. Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

ADCs are composed of three parts: a monoclonal antibody, a linker and a payload. A monoclonal antibody binds to the specific antigen present at the cancer cells, allowing selective delivery of the cytotoxic agents to the tumor site. Several ADCs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hematologic cancers and solid tumors with clinically meaningful survival benefit. However, the development of ADCs faces a lot of challenges and there is a need to get better understanding of ADCs in order to improve patient outcomes. Here, we briefly discuss the structure and mechanism of ADCs, as well as the clinical data of current approved ADCs in solid tumors.",

If the payloads are released systemically prematurely, the efficacy of the remaining circulating ADCs may be reduced, leading to off-target toxicity. Tandem cleavable linkers are novel linkers that incorporate a \u03b2-glucuronide moiety and require tandem enzymic cleavage events (47). These linkers reduce payloads release during circulation and off-target toxicity. \n\nSilencing the Fc portion of the ADCs. Whereas the Fc domain of the antibody induces immunogenicity, the internalisation of ADCs into non-targeted cells via Fc\u03b3 receptors on immune cells may provoke off-target toxicities. By silencing the Fc domain, Fc-mediated offtarget cytotoxicity was reduced (48). \n\nNovel site specific conjugation technologies. Conventional antibody conjugates have been constructed through cysteine or lysine residue side chains. These approaches were stochastic, non-specific conjugation and generated heterogenous ADCs. To overcome the drawback of non-specific conjugation, intense research to realise site specific conjugation has been conducted. Chemo-enzymatic methods include transglutaminase and glycan-mediated conjugation, and chemical methods include selective reduction of disulfides and N-terminal amine modifications (49).",

Shimizu, Nobuyuki Yamamoto\n## Abstract\nAbstract Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel class of anticancer treatment. ADCs are composed of three parts: a monoclonal antibody, a linker and a payload. A monoclonal antibody binds to the specific antigen present at the cancer cells, allowing selective delivery of the cytotoxic agents to the tumor site. Several ADCs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hematologic cancers and solid tumors with clinically meaningful survival benefit. However, the development of ADCs faces a lot of challenges and there is a need to get better understanding of ADCs in order to improve patient outcomes. Here, we briefly discuss the structure and mechanism of ADCs, as well as the clinical data of current approved ADCs in solid tumors.\n## Modifying conjugation technology or drug/linker chemistry\nTandem linker. One drawback associated with cleavable linkers is the potential to release payloads in plasma circulation before tumor targeting. If the payloads are released systemically prematurely, the efficacy of the remaining circulating ADCs may be reduced, leading to off-target toxicity. Tandem cleavable linkers are novel linkers that incorporate a \u03b2-glucuronide moiety and require tandem enzymic cleavage events (47). These linkers reduce payloads release during circulation and off-target toxicity. \n\nSilencing the Fc portion of the ADCs. Whereas the Fc domain of the antibody induces immunogenicity, the internalisation of ADCs into non-targeted cells via Fc\u03b3 receptors on immune cells may provoke off-target toxicities. By silencing the Fc domain, Fc-mediated offtarget cytotoxicity was reduced (48). \n\nNovel site specific conjugation technologies. Conventional antibody conjugates have been constructed through cysteine or lysine residue side chains. These approaches were stochastic, non-specific conjugation and generated heterogenous ADCs. To overcome the drawback of non-specific conjugation, intense research to realise site specific conjugation has been conducted. Chemo-enzymatic methods include transglutaminase and glycan-mediated conjugation, and chemical methods include selective reduction of disulfides and N-terminal amine modifications (49).",

Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

G. de la Torre, F. Albericio\n## Abstract\nAs one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment, chemotherapy has limited selectivity against cancer cells. Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.\n## Enzyme-Cleavable Linkers\nChemically labile linkers often have limited plasma stability, thereby leading to premature drug release.In this regard, as an alternative strategy, enzyme-cleavable linkers have achieved clinical success in controlled drug release.Unlike chemically labile linkers, enzyme-cleavable ones take advantage of the high concentration of unique hydrolytic enzymes in cellular compartments to degrade peptides and carbohydrates.\n\nPharmaceutics 2022, 14, 396 9 of 27 Peptide-Based Linkers Peptide-based linkers, also known as lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, such as valine-citrulline (Val-Cit), phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), and valine-alanine (Val-Ala) dipeptide linkers, are the most widely used linkers in ADC design.This strategy utilizes intracellular protease, such as Cathepsin B, which recognizes and cleaves a dipeptide bond, thus leading to the release of the cytotoxic drugs [89].Due to unsuitable pH conditions and serum protease inhibitors, peptide-based linkers show greater systemic stability, with rapid enzymatic release of the payload in the target cell [90].Exploring these types of linkers in ADC development often requires a conjugating spacer molecule due to the bulky nature of payload.The reagent most commonly used for this purpose is para-aminobenzyl carbamate (PABC) (Figure 8), which shows self-cleavage capacity, thereby facilitating the release of the unmodified payload [70].",

This review focuses on the molecular design of multimeric RGD compounds, as well as the design of suitable linkers for drug delivery. Many examples of RGD\u2013drug conjugates have been developed, and we show the importance of RGD constructs to enhance binding affinity to tumor cells, as well as their drug uptake. Further, we also highlight the use of RGD peptides as theranostic systems, promising tools offering dual modality, such as tumor diagnosis and therapy.

However, the linker connecting them also has a crucial impact on the delivery outcome, making the payload, ligand, and linker selections highly intertwined. The mode of action of a payload often requires it to be located inside a cell to be enabled, while cell entry can be driven by various mechanisms, including passive diffusion or internalization mediated by the targeting module (e.g., peptide ligand, small molecule, antibody, etc.). The linker must then be wisely selected accordingly to multiple features-whether the targeted payload is required to be released, in a traceless fashion or not, in intra-or extracellular media in a specific cellular compartment, as well as the propensity of a ligand to trigger internalization or not. \n\nFor the purpose of this review, we focus on cleavable linkers. After a brief listing of the main families of cleavable linkers illustrated with RGD applications, a deeper emphasis is made on cleavable linkers employed for multimeric RGD-based drug delivery. The first large family of cleavable linkers is made of enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, a distinction can be made between linkers that encompass a peptide sequence as a cleavage site (peptidase substrate) and others, as depicted below.",

Boturyn\n## Abstract\nRGD peptides have received a lot of attention over the two last decades, in particular to improve tumor therapy through the targeting of the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin receptor. This review focuses on the molecular design of multimeric RGD compounds, as well as the design of suitable linkers for drug delivery. Many examples of RGD\u2013drug conjugates have been developed, and we show the importance of RGD constructs to enhance binding affinity to tumor cells, as well as their drug uptake. Further, we also highlight the use of RGD peptides as theranostic systems, promising tools offering dual modality, such as tumor diagnosis and therapy. In conclusion, we address the challenging issues, as well as ongoing and future development, in comparison with large molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies.\n## Use of Cleavable Linker for Multimeric RGD-Based Drug Delivery\nThe efficient delivery of a payload (drug or diagnostic agent) is obviously related to the targeting module employed to drive it to the desired site of action. However, the linker connecting them also has a crucial impact on the delivery outcome, making the payload, ligand, and linker selections highly intertwined. The mode of action of a payload often requires it to be located inside a cell to be enabled, while cell entry can be driven by various mechanisms, including passive diffusion or internalization mediated by the targeting module (e.g., peptide ligand, small molecule, antibody, etc.). The linker must then be wisely selected accordingly to multiple features-whether the targeted payload is required to be released, in a traceless fashion or not, in intra-or extracellular media in a specific cellular compartment, as well as the propensity of a ligand to trigger internalization or not. \n\nFor the purpose of this review, we focus on cleavable linkers. After a brief listing of the main families of cleavable linkers illustrated with RGD applications, a deeper emphasis is made on cleavable linkers employed for multimeric RGD-based drug delivery. The first large family of cleavable linkers is made of enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, a distinction can be made between linkers that encompass a peptide sequence as a cleavage site (peptidase substrate) and others, as depicted below.\n\n## Cleavable Linkers in Multimeric RGD-Based Drug Delivery\nUnfortunately, no in vivo evaluation of RAFT-c(RGDfK) 4 -crypto has been realized yet. \n\nA lesson learned from the reported work is that cleavable linkers can be efficiently combined with multivalent RGD platforms to allow a triggered release inside or outside cells. However, we can notice that ester bonds are often used, while their stability in circulation is questionable, imparting the control of the release. Noteworthy, ester-cleavable linkers are nowadays rarely used in other delivery applications, such as antibody-drug conjugates [100]. Maybe this is one of the reasons why the in vivo assays of the reviewed multivalent RGD conjugates were almost all deceiving. This, as well as the fact that in vivo assays are not always realized despite interesting in vitro results, are possibly due to lack of facilities. Multivalent and cleavable linkers for controlled release are valuable tools, but it is likely that there is room for more research and new linker-multivalent ligand combinations to exploit their whole potential.

Representative examples include but are not limited to the following main structural components of ADCs: monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, brentuximab), linkers (pH-sensitive, reduction-sensitive, peptide-based, phosphate-based, and others), and payloads (doxorubicin, emtansine, ravtansine, calicheamicin). Regarding pharmacotherapy success, the high effectiveness expectation associated with ADC treatment is supported by the large number of ongoing clinical trials. Major aspects such as development strategies are first discussed, advantages and disadvantages, safety and efficacy, offering a retrospective insight on the subject.

Chi\u0219, C. Dobrea, A. Arseniu, Adina Frum, L. Rus, Gabriela Cormo\u0219, Cecilia Georgescu, C. Morgovan, Anca Butuca, F. Gligor, A. L. Vonica-\u021aincu\n## Abstract\nAntineoplastic therapy is one of the main research themes of this century. Modern approaches have been implemented to target and heighten the effect of cytostatic drugs on tumors and diminish their general/unspecific toxicity. In this context, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising and successful strategy. The aim of this review was to assess different aspects regarding ADCs. They were presented from a chemical and a pharmacological perspective and aspects like structure, conjugation and development particularities alongside effects, clinical trials, safety issues and perspectives and challenges for future use of these drugs were discussed. Representative examples include but are not limited to the following main structural components of ADCs: monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, brentuximab), linkers (pH-sensitive, reduction-sensitive, peptide-based, phosphate-based, and others), and payloads (doxorubicin, emtansine, ravtansine, calicheamicin). Regarding pharmacotherapy success, the high effectiveness expectation associated with ADC treatment is supported by the large number of ongoing clinical trials. Major aspects such as development strategies are first discussed, advantages and disadvantages, safety and efficacy, offering a retrospective insight on the subject. The second part of the review is prospective, focusing on various plans to overcome the previously identified difficulties.\n## Structural Optimization of ADCs\nThis technology facilitates direct conjugation of the active cargo subsequent to chemoselective reduction with tris(3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine, with the intent to merge Cys-based site-specific conjugation with other site-specific conjugation methods to research ADCs and capitalize on multiple mechanisms of action for efficacious cancer treatments [160].\n\nConsequently, in order to meet all criteria in the development of an ideal ADC, the following aspects must be considered: (i) the technology should be applicable to any mAb without the need for prior purification and/or chemical modification and (ii) the labeling procedure should not alter the attachment properties of the mAb [161].Most ADCs developed until now have been obtained using random conjugation to lysine or Cys residues.Nevertheless, since antibodies have about 40 lysine residues exposed on their surface and several Cys residues, payload binding generally results in a very heterogeneous mixture [162].Random conjugation can alter the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of the conjugated antibody, so strategies are needed to direct the development of means of attaching the payload to a specific antibody site [75].\n\nThe regioselectivity of these chemical modifications ought to be governed by the labeling fragment rather than by engineering or chemical modification of the antibody itself; thus, by modeling the chemical reaction with an aptamer [163], a small molecule [164], a protein [165], or a peptide [166], it has been possible to label unmodified proteins.Studies have been carried out on the approach of new metal-mediated cleavable linkers with singlecaged fragments that are designed for well-controlled payload release by the bioorthogonal bond cleavage reaction and toxicity diminution by substoichiometric amounts of metals that can reach the desired effectiveness [167,168].Metal-mediated linkers are based on palladium, ruthenium, copper, and platinum [169].\n\nOn the other hand, the conjugation strategy approached in the constitution of an ADC alters the homogeneity of the DAR, the release of cytotoxic payloads, and toxicity outside the therapeutic target.",

[42] Each component plays a crucial role in the efficacy and safety profile of ADCs. The mAb part of ADCs contributes to cancer cell selectivity, stability, and pharmacokinetic properties, while the payloads of ADCs exert anti-tumor effects by inducing cytotoxicity such as DNA damage or microtubule inhibition. For the chemical linker in ADCs, both cleavable and non-cleavable chemical structures have been utilized. Cleavable linkers enable controlled release of the cytotoxic payload intracellularly or within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable ADC linkers can be categorized into three types: protease-sensitive linkers utilizing protease cleavable peptide sequences like cathepsin B sensitive valine-citrulline (VC) dipeptide, pH-sensitive linkers attached to acid-labile groups such as hydrazone, and glutathione-sensitive linkers containing disulfide bonds. Whereas, non-cleavable linkers, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) groups, exhibit enhanced plasma stability, and potentially improving the therapeutic index. [44] The extensive ADC research and its notable efficacy have resulted in the FDA approval for 12 ADCs, with over 260 undergoing clinical trials as of 2022. [45]  limitations of ADCs have arisen from their uniform payloads, which are driving ADC research towards payload diversification and prompting the development of degrader-antibody conjugates (DACs). [46] espite the promising potential of PROTACs, their development remains challenging due to their metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK). [47] To overcome these limitations, DACs have been developed by harnessing mAb-mediated PROTAC delivery. Given the pivotal role of BET family proteins in various cancers, [48][49][50] bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) targeting DACs have been developed. [34,51]",

Here, we examine various methodologies for achieving site-specific dual-payload conjugation, including the use of multi-functional linkers, canonical amino acids, non-canonical amino acids, and enzyme-mediated methods, all of which facilitate precise control over payload attachment while ensuring homogeneity. We explore the implications of different conjugation techniques on drug-to-antibody ratios and the ratios of the two payloads, as well as their impact on process complexity and manufacturability. Additionally, we address the potential advantages of dual-payload ADCs compared to ADCs combined with traditional chemotherapy or single-payload ADC/ADC combinations. By evaluating these innovative methods, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape in dual-payload ADC development and outline emerging directions necessary for further advancement of this promising therapeutic strategy.",

Following desalting to remove excess TCO and azide linkers, two fluorescent dyes, rhodamine with an extracellular protease-sensitive matrix metalloproteinase-2 cleavable linker and fluorescein with an intracellular protease-sensitive cathepsin B cleavable linker, were site- specifically conjugated to the adaptors containing azide and TCO, respectively (Figure 6a). Incubation of the dual dye conjugates with HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 cells demonstrated the extracellular release of rhodamine and the intracellular release of fluorescein. With distinct extracellular and intracellular release triggers, this proof-of-concept study highlighted the potential for delivering drugs with differential spatial release from a single conjugate for cooperative drug combinations efficacies. \n\nResearchers at Pfizer reported a dual-payload conjugation method utilizing mTG in conjunction with engineered cysteines. 107 The goal of this research was to develop a solidphase conjugation method to facilitate high-throughput production of dual-payload conjugates. mAbs with engineered cysteine residues were first deglycosylated to expose the Q295 site for mTG conjugation. The IgGs were then immobilized on a protein A (ProA) resin, followed by conjugation with a BCN-containing adapter. Afterward, the immobilized antibody underwent reduction and reoxidation, resulting in the introduction of two chemically orthogonal reactive groups, strained alkyne (BCN) and thiol, on the antibody, primed for dual-payload conjugation (Figure 6b). In this study, BODIPYmaleimide and Cy5.5-azide were conjugated to the linkers in a single-step reaction, achieving overall labeling efficiencies of 95% at the Q295 site and 80% at the engineered cysteine 183 on the LC.",

Here, we examine various methodologies for achieving site-specific dual-payload conjugation, including the use of multi-functional linkers, canonical amino acids, non-canonical amino acids, and enzyme-mediated methods, all of which facilitate precise control over payload attachment while ensuring homogeneity. We explore the implications of different conjugation techniques on drug-to-antibody ratios and the ratios of the two payloads, as well as their impact on process complexity and manufacturability. Additionally, we address the potential advantages of dual-payload ADCs compared to ADCs combined with traditional chemotherapy or single-payload ADC/ADC combinations. By evaluating these innovative methods, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape in dual-payload ADC development and outline emerging directions necessary for further advancement of this promising therapeutic strategy.\n## Enzyme-mediated methods\nSubsequently, mTG was used to introduce a PEG3-azide linker at the Q295 position on the HC of trastuzumab. Following desalting to remove excess TCO and azide linkers, two fluorescent dyes, rhodamine with an extracellular protease-sensitive matrix metalloproteinase-2 cleavable linker and fluorescein with an intracellular protease-sensitive cathepsin B cleavable linker, were site- specifically conjugated to the adaptors containing azide and TCO, respectively (Figure 6a). Incubation of the dual dye conjugates with HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 cells demonstrated the extracellular release of rhodamine and the intracellular release of fluorescein. With distinct extracellular and intracellular release triggers, this proof-of-concept study highlighted the potential for delivering drugs with differential spatial release from a single conjugate for cooperative drug combinations efficacies. \n\nResearchers at Pfizer reported a dual-payload conjugation method utilizing mTG in conjunction with engineered cysteines. 107 The goal of this research was to develop a solidphase conjugation method to facilitate high-throughput production of dual-payload conjugates. mAbs with engineered cysteine residues were first deglycosylated to expose the Q295 site for mTG conjugation. The IgGs were then immobilized on a protein A (ProA) resin, followed by conjugation with a BCN-containing adapter. Afterward, the immobilized antibody underwent reduction and reoxidation, resulting in the introduction of two chemically orthogonal reactive groups, strained alkyne (BCN) and thiol, on the antibody, primed for dual-payload conjugation (Figure 6b). In this study, BODIPYmaleimide and Cy5.5-azide were conjugated to the linkers in a single-step reaction, achieving overall labeling efficiencies of 95% at the Q295 site and 80% at the engineered cysteine 183 on the LC.",

The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, combining monoclonal antibody specificity with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic payloads. This review highlights recent advancements, opportunities, and challenges in ADC application for urinary tumors. We discuss the FDA-approved ADCs and other novel ADCs under investigation, emphasizing their potential to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, we explore strategies to address challenges, such as toxicity management, predictive biomarker identification, and resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we examine the integration of ADCs with other treatment modalities, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and radiation therapy. By addressing these challenges and exploring innovative approaches, the development of ADCs may significantly enhance therapeutic options and outcomes for patients with advanced urinary tumor.\n## The three key components of ADC and development strategies\nADCs are composed of three integral components: a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets tumor antigens, a cytotoxic payload designed to disrupt DNA or tubulin within the targeted cancer cells, and a linker that covalently attaches the antibody to the payload. The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

Complementary mass spectrometry approaches such as peptide mapping and intact mass analysis are required for the in-depth characterization of these bioconjugates. Cysteine-linked ADCs have shown a unique challenge for characterization, mainly when the conjugation is carried out on interchain cysteines, because their intact analysis requires native mass spectrometry conditions to preserve non-covalent binding between antibody chains. In this work, two different approaches were proposed. Specifically, a full scan data-independent all ion fragmentation (FS-AIF) and a full scan data-dependent targeted MS2 (FS-ddtMS2) were applied to generate complementary datasets for a cysteine-linked ADC characterization with a highly reactive payload. These two methods were applied to in vitro plasma stability and in vivo PK samples to calculate and refine mean drug-to-antibody ratio over time. Using this approach, we successfully characterized an ADC containing a hydrolysis-sensitive payload and refined the \u201cactive\u201d drug-to-antibody ratio on in vitro stability and in vivo samples. These two methods allowed the confirmation of the different ADC species and potential metabolites of conjugated payload attached to the antibody backbone in a single analysis without needing a dedicated method for the conjugated payload metabolite identification.",

Complementary mass spectrometry approaches such as peptide mapping and intact mass analysis are required for the in-depth characterization of these bioconjugates. Cysteine-linked ADCs have shown a unique challenge for characterization, mainly when the conjugation is carried out on interchain cysteines, because their intact analysis requires native mass spectrometry conditions to preserve non-covalent binding between antibody chains. In this work, two different approaches were proposed. Specifically, a full scan data-independent all ion fragmentation (FS-AIF) and a full scan data-dependent targeted MS2 (FS-ddtMS2) were applied to generate complementary datasets for a cysteine-linked ADC characterization with a highly reactive payload. These two methods were applied to in vitro plasma stability and in vivo PK samples to calculate and refine mean drug-to-antibody ratio over time. Using this approach, we successfully characterized an ADC containing a hydrolysis-sensitive payload and refined the \u201cactive\u201d drug-to-antibody ratio on in vitro stability and in vivo samples. These two methods allowed the confirmation of the different ADC species and potential metabolites of conjugated payload attached to the antibody backbone in a single analysis without needing a dedicated method for the conjugated payload metabolite identification.\n## Introduction\nThey may not release drugs into the extracellular space and cannot kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect [18]. Furthermore, optimal linker selection depends on the chosen target antigen. Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in plasma, but rapidly release the active drug within lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes [19]. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence recognized and cleaved by these proteases. The primary goal of all linkers in ADCs is to ensure the specific release of the active drug within target cells, which is essential for controlling the toxicity of the highly potent drugs used to construct ADCs. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity changes for the above-mentioned linkers. Moreover, the ideal linker chemistry choice ultimately depends on experimentally determining the optimal combination of the suitable linker, the ideal target antigen, and the desired payload [20,21]. A comprehensive understanding of the structural integrity of the linker, the payload and the conjugation site during biological exposure is crucial throughout the process of novel linker-payload design and optimization of the PK profile [22]. This understanding represents a key aspect in maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity in preclinical testing and it is essential for ensuring the successful translation to the clinical setting [23,24]. \n\nThis bioconjugate modality's complexity is a source of significant challenge for analytical investigation and analysis, especially in vivo [25]. Nowadays, both Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Liquid Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have been employed to support ADC discovery and development projects [26,27]. Ligand-binding assays (LBAs) are considered the golden standard to measure antibody concentration (both total and conjugated antibody analytes), whereas LC-MS methods are usually employed to quantify both free and conjugated toxin [28,29].",

To fully harness the potential of this technology, a growing paradigm toward enriching PROTACs with other therapeutic modalities has been proposed. Could researchers successfully combine two modalities to yield multifunctional PROTACs with an expanded profile? In this Perspective, we try to answer this question. We discuss how this possibility encompasses different approaches, leading to multitarget PROTACs, light-controllable PROTACs, PROTAC conjugates, and macrocycle- and oligonucleotide-based PROTACs. This possibility promises to further enhance PROTAC efficacy and selectivity, minimize side effects, and hit undruggable targets. While PROTACs have reached the clinical investigation stage, additional steps must be taken toward the translational development of multifunctional PROTACs. A deeper and detailed understanding of the most critical challenges is required to fully exploit these opportunities and decisively enrich the PROTAC toolbox.",

Typically, SMDCs feature three parts, i.e., a targeting ligand, a cleavable linker, and a therapeutically active small molecule. Targeted drug conjugates act by recognizing target cells through overexpressed receptors and, once internalized, selectively releasing the therapeutic agent. In most cases, release occurs following linker cleavage by intracellular thiols 98 or by using selfimmolative linkers responsive to specific stimuli, such as pH, redox system, and light. 94,99 s mentioned earlier, PROTACs effect highly efficient protein degradation and represent a unique therapeutic strategy. However, when addressing target proteins expressed in most of tissues, PROTACs may lack selectivity. Clearly, tissue-or organspecific degradation can be achieved by exploiting differential biology and expression levels of E3 ligases. 35 Another possibility is the development of a site-or tissue-specific delivery system that can reduce potential toxicity and increase the therapeutic window and eventually the translatability into the clinical setting. Thus, PROTAC conjugates have attracted considerable attention for targeted delivery (Figure 10). \n\nIn the following sections, (i) antibody-(Figure 10A) and (ii) small molecule-PROTAC conjugates (Figure 10B) will be discussed from the viewpoint of a double modality. \n\n5.1.

Salerno, Francesca Seghetti, Jessica Caciolla, Elisa Uliassi, Eleonora Testi, Melissa Guardigni, M. Roberti, A. Milelli, M. Bolognesi\n## Abstract\nProteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)-mediated protein degradation has prompted a radical rethink and is at a crucial stage in driving a drug discovery transition. To fully harness the potential of this technology, a growing paradigm toward enriching PROTACs with other therapeutic modalities has been proposed. Could researchers successfully combine two modalities to yield multifunctional PROTACs with an expanded profile? In this Perspective, we try to answer this question. We discuss how this possibility encompasses different approaches, leading to multitarget PROTACs, light-controllable PROTACs, PROTAC conjugates, and macrocycle- and oligonucleotide-based PROTACs. This possibility promises to further enhance PROTAC efficacy and selectivity, minimize side effects, and hit undruggable targets. While PROTACs have reached the clinical investigation stage, additional steps must be taken toward the translational development of multifunctional PROTACs. A deeper and detailed understanding of the most critical challenges is required to fully exploit these opportunities and decisively enrich the PROTAC toolbox.\n## COMBINING PROTAC AND DRUG CONJUGATE MODALITIES\nIn recent decades, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to diseased cells and tissues, and not to healthy ones, has been made possible by nanotechnology approaches 94 or by drug conjugates featuring a targeting moiety. 95 Antibody\u2212drug conjugates (ADCs) are generally comprised of an antibody (Ab) conjugated to a cytotoxic payload via a chemical linker. 96 hree ADC therapeutics (trastuzumab emtansine, brentuximab vedotin, and inotuzumab ozogamicin) are already on the market, and several others are being investigated in clinical trials. 97 More recently, small molecule\u2212drug conjugates (SMDCs) have provided an opportunity for targeted delivery. Typically, SMDCs feature three parts, i.e., a targeting ligand, a cleavable linker, and a therapeutically active small molecule. Targeted drug conjugates act by recognizing target cells through overexpressed receptors and, once internalized, selectively releasing the therapeutic agent. In most cases, release occurs following linker cleavage by intracellular thiols 98 or by using selfimmolative linkers responsive to specific stimuli, such as pH, redox system, and light. 94,99 s mentioned earlier, PROTACs effect highly efficient protein degradation and represent a unique therapeutic strategy. However, when addressing target proteins expressed in most of tissues, PROTACs may lack selectivity. Clearly, tissue-or organspecific degradation can be achieved by exploiting differential biology and expression levels of E3 ligases. 35 Another possibility is the development of a site-or tissue-specific delivery system that can reduce potential toxicity and increase the therapeutic window and eventually the translatability into the clinical setting. Thus, PROTAC conjugates have attracted considerable attention for targeted delivery (Figure 10). \n\nIn the following sections, (i) antibody-(Figure 10A) and (ii) small molecule-PROTAC conjugates (Figure 10B) will be discussed from the viewpoint of a double modality. \n\n5.1. Antibody\u2212PROTAC Conjugates.",

Biochemically triggered cleavable conjugation is thus crucial and timely due to its potential to response as per the loco-regional environment. It enables targeted release of therapeutic agents in response to specific biochemical signals and thus minimizing off-target effects and improving treatment precision. It holds promise in a range of biomedical applications, including cancer therapy, senolytic therapy, gene therapy, and regenerative medicine. The focus of this review is to offer comprehensive insight into the significance of biochemically cleavable conjugations within intrinsically stimuli-responsive architectures. Pathological conditions and alteration in tissues microenvironment in the body exhibit distinct biochemical settings characterized by change in redox potential, pH level, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and various catalytic protein/enzyme overexpression. Understanding these intrinsic features is crucial for researchers aiming to develop intelligent cleavable bio-engineered systems for biomedicines. By strategically designing cleavable linkage, researchers can leverage the variations in the tumor, infection, inflammation, and senescence microenvironments. Through an extensive examination of relevant literature, we present a comprehensive classification of the intrinsic physicochemical differences found in pathological areas and their applications in drug delivery, prodrug activation, imaging, and theranostics for future personalised medicines. This review will provide comprehensive guidance and critical insights to researchers in both industry and academia who are involved in the design of advanced, functional biochemically cleavable conjugations.",

                    "text": "Introducing cleavable linkages into optimized systems often alters activity profiles, while chemical building blocks used in conjugations may prove incompatible with the intricacies of biological systems, leading to discouraging outcomes in clinical trials. Additionally, maintaining the activity of biomolecules such as antibodies, cargo, proteins, and fluorescent tags is particularly challenging. Determining the optimal linker length is another obstacle, as it directly impacts the proximity and likelihood of ligand-target interactions. Lastly, both the designed systems and their by-products may pose toxic effects on living cells, raising critical safety concerns. \n\n-Similarly, Section 7-Future Perspective should be summarized after emphasizing promising key areas as bulleted paragraphs while figuring out their potential impacts in those fields. \n\nResponse: Thank you for the valuable suggestion. We have carefully rewritten section 5 (Challenges) in the revised manuscript as follow: \n\nAs we advance toward personalized and targeted healthcare, the future of biochemically cleavable conjugations offers immense promise for transforming biomedicine. In targeted drug delivery, conjugation strategies designed to respond to specific molecular disease signatures could enable highly effective and personalized treatments for conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections. In the realm of personalized medicine, a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms is poised to integrate biochemically cleavable conjugations into individualized treatment plans, enhancing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse reactions. \n\nAdvanced imaging and diagnostics stand to benefit from conjugates with biochemically cleavable linkers that remain inactive until encountering specific biological triggers, improving specificity, reducing background noise, and enabling non-invasive, highly sensitive disease detection. The emergence of multimodal imaging agents capable of detecting multiple disease markers may further facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Theranostics, which merges therapeutic and diagnostic functionalities into a single entity, is another area of promise, as biochemically cleavable conjugations can enable real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy while delivering therapeutic agents to target sites. This approach allows clinicians to make data-driven decisions, optimizing treatment regimens based on patient responses. Finally, innovative conjugation strategies in combination therapies could enable precise and sequential drug release, improving treatment outcomes and reducing drug resistance.",

Biochemically triggered cleavable conjugation is thus crucial and timely due to its potential to response as per the loco-regional environment. It enables targeted release of therapeutic agents in response to specific biochemical signals and thus minimizing off-target effects and improving treatment precision. It holds promise in a range of biomedical applications, including cancer therapy, senolytic therapy, gene therapy, and regenerative medicine. The focus of this review is to offer comprehensive insight into the significance of biochemically cleavable conjugations within intrinsically stimuli-responsive architectures. Pathological conditions and alteration in tissues microenvironment in the body exhibit distinct biochemical settings characterized by change in redox potential, pH level, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and various catalytic protein/enzyme overexpression. Understanding these intrinsic features is crucial for researchers aiming to develop intelligent cleavable bio-engineered systems for biomedicines. By strategically designing cleavable linkage, researchers can leverage the variations in the tumor, infection, inflammation, and senescence microenvironments. Through an extensive examination of relevant literature, we present a comprehensive classification of the intrinsic physicochemical differences found in pathological areas and their applications in drug delivery, prodrug activation, imaging, and theranostics for future personalised medicines. This review will provide comprehensive guidance and critical insights to researchers in both industry and academia who are involved in the design of advanced, functional biochemically cleavable conjugations.\n## body\nIntroducing cleavable linkages into optimized systems often alters activity profiles, while chemical building blocks used in conjugations may prove incompatible with the intricacies of biological systems, leading to discouraging outcomes in clinical trials. Additionally, maintaining the activity of biomolecules such as antibodies, cargo, proteins, and fluorescent tags is particularly challenging. Determining the optimal linker length is another obstacle, as it directly impacts the proximity and likelihood of ligand-target interactions. Lastly, both the designed systems and their by-products may pose toxic effects on living cells, raising critical safety concerns. \n\n-Similarly, Section 7-Future Perspective should be summarized after emphasizing promising key areas as bulleted paragraphs while figuring out their potential impacts in those fields. \n\nResponse: Thank you for the valuable suggestion. We have carefully rewritten section 5 (Challenges) in the revised manuscript as follow: \n\nAs we advance toward personalized and targeted healthcare, the future of biochemically cleavable conjugations offers immense promise for transforming biomedicine. In targeted drug delivery, conjugation strategies designed to respond to specific molecular disease signatures could enable highly effective and personalized treatments for conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections. In the realm of personalized medicine, a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms is poised to integrate biochemically cleavable conjugations into individualized treatment plans, enhancing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse reactions. \n\nAdvanced imaging and diagnostics stand to benefit from conjugates with biochemically cleavable linkers that remain inactive until encountering specific biological triggers, improving specificity, reducing background noise, and enabling non-invasive, highly sensitive disease detection. The emergence of multimodal imaging agents capable of detecting multiple disease markers may further facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Theranostics, which merges therapeutic and diagnostic functionalities into a single entity, is another area of promise, as biochemically cleavable conjugations can enable real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy while delivering therapeutic agents to target sites. This approach allows clinicians to make data-driven decisions, optimizing treatment regimens based on patient responses. Finally, innovative conjugation strategies in combination therapies could enable precise and sequential drug release, improving treatment outcomes and reducing drug resistance.",

Recent advancements have given rise to non-cleavable linkers, notably the SMCC (Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) linkers and MD (Molecular Dynamics) linkers, which are currently in development. The hydrophilic nature of linker plays a pivotal role in diminishing nonspecific uptake or off-target toxicity of payload. SMCC linkers incorporate a cyclo-nucleic acid ring that reduces the antibody conjugate's hydrolysis rate at high pH levels, thus bolstering stability while preserving antibody specificity. On the other hand, MD linkers substitute the cyclo-nucleic acid ring of SMCC linkers with 1,3-dioxolein, enhancing linker hydrophilicity and stability due to the presence of two oxygen atoms within the 1,3-dioxolein ring (Figure 4). Notably, the current ADCs technologies making use of this approach include Kadcycla \u00ae (Basel, Switzerland) [44][45][46]. proved Hodgkin's lymphoma drug brentuximab vedotin using an CD30 antibody with a peptide cleavable linker and MMAE [39]. Furthermore, various enzyme-based linkers, such as \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b2-galactosidase linkers, have been developed [40][41][42][43] (Figure 4). These are degraded by enzymes present in lysosomes, rendering them more stable in the bloodstream compared to chemically cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers, which remain intact within the lysosome post-internalization and do not undergo degradation, lead to antibody degradation by lysosomal peptidases. This, in turn, results in the release of payload and triggers cytotoxicity, causing cell death (Figure 3).",

Limited by numerous disadvantages, conventional chemotherapy is being replaced by new strategies targeting tumor cells. In this context, therapies based on biopolymer prodrug systems represent a promising alternative for improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic properties of drugs and reducing their toxicity. The polymer-directed enzyme prodrug therapy is based on tumor cell targeting and release of the drug using polymer\u2013drug and polymer\u2013enzyme conjugates. In addition, current trends are oriented towards natural sources. They are biocompatible, biodegradable, and represent a valuable and renewable source. Therefore, numerous antitumor molecules have been conjugated with natural polymers. The present manuscript highlights the latest research focused on polymer\u2013drug conjugates containing natural polymers such as chitosan, hyaluronic acid, dextran, pullulan, silk fibroin, heparin, and polysaccharides from Auricularia auricula.",

In this case cytotoxic agent (payload) is connected to the tumor-targeting carrier via a cleavable (stimuli responsive) or non-cleavable linker. Tumor-targeting carrier may be an antibody, a protein, or a peptide and the resulting conjugates are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), protein-drug conjugates (PrDCs) and peptide-drug conjugates (PeDCs). A key factor, in the design of all these conjugates is the linker which influences the stability of the conjugate, modulates the release of the cytotoxic agent and the pharmacokinetics [232][233][234][235][236]. \n\nADCs with humanized antibodies showed low immunogenicity and better half-lives in comparison with ones with murine antibodies, but due to size and complex structure their use is somehow limited to hematologic malignancies and rarely to solid tumors. By means of PEGylation certain properties of anti-bodies can be modified (increased halflives and reduced immunogenicity). Nowadays there are twelve ADCs approved by FDA (starting with Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, more than two decades ago) [236][237][238][239]. \n\nPrDCs ensures improved pharmacokinetics, long blood residence and reduced toxicity by selective distribution in targeted cells. Physicochemical criteria are used to identify suitable proteins for conjugation. Several PrDCs (with albumin, transferrin, gelatin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, insulin, etc.,) are now in preclinical or clinical phases of clinical trials [236,[240][241][242][243][244].",

Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

The antibody component reduces the cytotoxic effects on off-targets, making ADCs a popular area of research for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. This review article aims to provide an overview of ADCs in today\u2019s cancer therapy landscape. We summarize the currently used ADCs with their cytotoxic payloads, targets, and therapeutic indications. We discuss the mechanisms of action of ADCs, as well as the associated toxicities and newly emerging mechanisms of drug resistance. We also elaborate on some of the current efforts to advance present ADC strategies, as well as opportunities for the future of ADC-based cancer therapy.\n## The Chemical Linker\nThe linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

            "text": "Before we move towards the various cargos that are being explored for ADCs, we will briefly summarize recent advances in conjugation techniques and linker designs. Both aspects play a key role in ADC stability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic [58,59]. Relevant parameters for the conjugation strategy are the site-of-attachment, the drug-to-antibody ratio and stability in biological matrices (Fig. 3). While stability is an important design feature of linkers, further aspects like solubility, release mechanisms and multivalency are being considered as relevant for the potency and safety of ADCs. In this section we highlight how researchers have implemented these features in recently developed conjugation methods and linker designs. For a comprehensive overview of site-selective modification strategies for ADCs we would like to bring your attention to a very recent review by Walsh et al. [60] and a detailed and comprehensive review of cleavable linkers can be found in a 2019 review by Bargh et al. [61]. \n\nCurrently approved ADCs exclusively use amine-or thiol-directed conjugation for drug attachment. In these cases, drugs are attached to surface exposed lysine residues or reduced intrachain-disulfides, respectively. By targeting endogenous residues, no engineering of the antibody is necessary. However, the site of attachment and the number of attached molecules is hard to control, leading to a heterogenous product containing multiple ADC species of varying DARs. Furthermore, cysteine conjugation via maleimides poses the risk for hydrolysis and thiolexchange to endogenous proteins in biological matrices [62,63]. These aspects are considered to negatively affect the potency and safety of the conjugates [63][64][65].",

For example, Mylotarg, which consists of an anti-CD33 antibody and calicheamicin through an acid-cleavable hydrazone linker (i.e., chemically cleavable linker), is used for AML therapy [98]. Similarly, a hydrazone linker is also used to connect anti-CD22 mAbs to cytotoxins such as calicheamicin (inotuzumab ozogamicin) and pasudotox-tdfk (moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk) for treatment of CD22-positive ALL and relapsed hairy cell leukemia in clinics, respectively [49,66,99,100]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers maintain the coupling integrity of the aptamer and drugs throughout the entire drug action process and usually rely on complete degradation of the aptamer (or antibody) within the lysosomes to release the attached payload [90].",

            "text": "Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile. While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

However, cleavable linkers in the oligonucleotide field are scarce, particularly with respect to the requirement for traceless release of the payload in vivo. Herein, we describe a cathepsin B-cleavable dipeptide phosphoramidite, Val-Ala(NB) for the automated synthesis of oligonucleotide-small molecule conjugates. Val-Ala(NB) was protected by a photolabile 2-nitrobenzyl group to improve the stability of the peptide linker during DNA synthesis. Intracellular cathepsin B digests the dipeptide efficiently, releasing the payload-phosphate which is converted to the free payload by endogenous phosphatase enzymes. With the advantages of modular synthesis and stimuli-responsive drug release, we believe Val-Ala(NB) will be a potentially valuable cleavable linker for use in oligonucleotide-drug conjugates.",

            "text": "The efficient delivery of a payload (drug or diagnostic agent) is obviously related to the targeting module employed to drive it to the desired site of action. However, the linker connecting them also has a crucial impact on the delivery outcome, making the payload, ligand, and linker selections highly intertwined. The mode of action of a payload often requires it to be located inside a cell to be enabled, while cell entry can be driven by various mechanisms, including passive diffusion or internalization mediated by the targeting module (e.g., peptide ligand, small molecule, antibody, etc.). The linker must then be wisely selected accordingly to multiple features-whether the targeted payload is required to be released, in a traceless fashion or not, in intra-or extracellular media in a specific cellular compartment, as well as the propensity of a ligand to trigger internalization or not. \n\nFor the purpose of this review, we focus on cleavable linkers. After a brief listing of the main families of cleavable linkers illustrated with RGD applications, a deeper emphasis is made on cleavable linkers employed for multimeric RGD-based drug delivery. The first large family of cleavable linkers is made of enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, a distinction can be made between linkers that encompass a peptide sequence as a cleavage site (peptidase substrate) and others, as depicted below.",

            "text": "Notably, the TTL has a broad substrate tolerance and thus allows the incorporation of a variety of bioorthogonal handles [111] for subsequent site-specific toxin-conjugation. \n\nApart from these well-established methods several more site-specific conjugation concepts, like pi-clamp [112] or CD38 domain-tag [113], and conjugation to native lysines by using affinity peptides, e.g., as guides [114,115] have been published in the context of ADC generation and are comprehensively covered elsewhere [60,116]. Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

A prime example is valine-citrulline (Val-Cit), employed in conjugating brentuximab vedotin with MMAE (Supplementary Fig. 2A); this linker relies on cathepsin B, an intracellular protease, to cleave a dipeptide bond and release the payload. Loncastuximab tesirine (Supplementary Fig. 2B) also utilizes the same linker to conjugate PBD dimers. Another class of enzymatically cleavable linkers is based on phosphatase-cleavable, with enzyme targets pyrophosphatase and acid phosphatase in lysosomal compartments. Disitamab vedotin, an anti-HER2 antibody, enfortumab vedotin, an anti-Nectin-4 antibody, polatuzumab vedotin, an anti-CD79b antibody, and tisotumab vedotin, an anti-tissue factor antibody utilizes this strategy to conjugate MMAE through maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxylcarbonyl (PABC) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). This latter, a self-cleavage spacer between the Val-Cit dipeptide and the drug, improves cathepsin B access for the cleavage site [158,159]. \n\nOther cleavable linkers include mirvetuximab soravtansine, an anti-FR\u0251 antibody conjugated to DM4 through a cleavable sulfo-SPDB linker (Supplementary Fig. 2H), and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, an anti-HER2 antibody conjugated to DXd via Glycine-Glycine-Phenylalanine-Glycine (GGFC) (Supplementary Fig. 2D) [136]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers can be grouped into thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) categories.",

The main site-specific conjugation strategies include the use of engineered cysteine residues, unnatural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation through glycotransferases and transglutaminases. However, many issues remain to be addressed, including off-target toxicity due to instability, drug resistance in cancer cells, retro-Michael elimination reaction of the maleimide linker, heterogeneity of the DAR, and insufficient linker-payload connectivity. All these issues suggest that the technological update of the linker is closely related to the breakthrough of ADC (44)(45)(46).",

            "text": "Cysteine conjugation has relatively controllable conjugation sites because of the fixed positions of the disulfide bonds, but the number of connections is affected by the degree of disulfide bond reduction. When all four interchain disulfide bonds are completely reduced, each antibody can carry eight toxins; when they are partially reduced, products with DARs of 2, 4, 6 and 8 may be generated. Therefore, the cysteine conjugation products have significantly greater homogeneity than the lysine conjugation products. Site-specific conjugation mainly relies on biotechnology to introduce linker sites on the monoclonal antibody, which enables precise site and stoichiometric control. To incorporate UAAs, an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair is used to replace the amber codon TAG in the monoclonal antibody with p-acetyl phenylalanine (pAcF). Small-molecule toxic drugs are then conjugated to pAcF, and the amount of pAcF represents the amount of drug conjugated (16). With advances in ADC conjugation methods, the problem of heterogeneous DARs in ADCs has been gradually solved. Two broad properties of the linker have been identified, and each retains the homogeneity and stability of ADCs under appropriate conditions (17). The linker is a critical safeguard that maintains the stability of the cytotoxic payload and protects physiological functions by eliminating excess toxicity before internalization. After transport through the blood to localize at tumor sites, removal of the linker accelerates cytotoxic drug release, which is a unique advantage over mAbs (18). Linkers are classified into two groups: cleavable and noncleavable. Cleavable linkers are used more often and have a wider range of applications. In the classical endocytosis pathway, ADCs are delivered into lysosomes, where the cleavable linker can be cleaved by a high concentration of hydrolytic enzymes. Likewise, the cleavable linker responds to acid, reducible disulfides and other exogenous stimuli (19).",

The Cys was introduced to its C-terminus and then it was conjugated to the thiol-containing modified PLGA. In another study, the effect of the linker on the activity was studied. The gp100(25-33) peptide was covalently attached to the spherical nucleic acid via three different linkers [95]. First, the \u03b1-amino group of the peptide was acylated with three different thiol-reactive linkers. Then the modified peptide was conjugated with nucleic acid using the thiol-reactive functional group of the linker. Three different types of connections were used: non-cleavable, tracelessly cleavable (after the reduction, the linker is removed from the N-terminus of the peptide), and cleavable (the reduced linker remains on the Nterminus of the peptide) (Figure 3b). The traceless linker was the most potent (8-fold improvement in T cell proliferation), highlighting the importance of the selected linker in this strategy. Similarly, melanoma-specific antigens (TRP-1, TRP-2, gp100, and MART-1 derived peptides) with Cys at their C-terminus were conjugated to antibodies using the sulfhydryl-maleimide reaction [96]. In another example, strain promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry was used to synthesize an antigen-containing nanoconstruct [97]. TRP-2(180-188) was modified with azidovaleric acid via a PEG spacer at its N-terminus. In this construct, the antigen could not be released intracellularly because of the non-cleavable covalent bond (Figure 3c). A similar strategy was used to conjugate OVA (257-264), OVA(323-339), and M30 (PSKPSFQEFVDWENVSPELNSTDQPFL) [98].",

We present a highly efficient phosphonamidate-based conjugation handle that combines a discrete hydrophilic PEG-substituent, an established linker-payload and a cysteine-selective electrophile in one compact building block. This reactive entity provides homogeneous ADCs with a high drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8 in a one-pot reduction and alkylation protocol from non-engineered antibodies. The compact branched PEG-architecture introduces hydrophilicity without increasing the distance between antibody and payload, allowing the generation of the first homogeneous DAR 8 ADC from VC-PAB-MMAE without increased in vivo clearance rates. This high DAR ADC exhibits excellent in vivo stability and increased antitumor activity in tumour xenograft models relative to the established FDA approved VC-PAB-MMAE ADC Adcetris, clearly showing the benefit of the phosphonamidate based building-blocks as a general tool for the efficient and stable antibody-based delivery of highly hydrophobic linker-payload systems.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of tumor-targeting mAbs, which are conjugated to cytotoxic payloads via chemical linkers. [42] Each component plays a crucial role in the efficacy and safety profile of ADCs. The mAb part of ADCs contributes to cancer cell selectivity, stability, and pharmacokinetic properties, while the payloads of ADCs exert anti-tumor effects by inducing cytotoxicity such as DNA damage or microtubule inhibition. For the chemical linker in ADCs, both cleavable and non-cleavable chemical structures have been utilized. Cleavable linkers enable controlled release of the cytotoxic payload intracellularly or within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable ADC linkers can be categorized into three types: protease-sensitive linkers utilizing protease cleavable peptide sequences like cathepsin B sensitive valine-citrulline (VC) dipeptide, pH-sensitive linkers attached to acid-labile groups such as hydrazone, and glutathione-sensitive linkers containing disulfide bonds. Whereas, non-cleavable linkers, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) groups, exhibit enhanced plasma stability, and potentially improving the therapeutic index. [44] The extensive ADC research and its notable efficacy have resulted in the FDA approval for 12 ADCs, with over 260 undergoing clinical trials as of 2022. [45]  limitations of ADCs have arisen from their uniform payloads, which are driving ADC research towards payload diversification and prompting the development of degrader-antibody conjugates (DACs). [46] espite the promising potential of PROTACs, their development remains challenging due to their metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK). [47] To overcome these limitations, DACs have been developed by harnessing mAb-mediated PROTAC delivery. Given the pivotal role of BET family proteins in various cancers, [48][49][50] bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) targeting DACs have been developed. [34,51]",

            "text": "While in theory antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver high-dose chemotherapy directly to target cells, numerous side effects are observed in clinical practice. We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998\u2014July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20091 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20092,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20094,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) \u2265 grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.",

First, analytical test reactions were set up to assess conjugation efficiency and monomeric purity of the conjugates. To attach the thiol-reactive drug-linker, interchain disulfide bridges were reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and afterward incubated with the drug-linker for 2 h. Subsequently, monomeric purity was analyzed via analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) via polymeric reversed-phase HPLC (PLRP). While conjugation efficiency appeared to be most efficient for 1.0_Fab and 6.18_Fab (both DAR = 5.8, Figure 4b), it was slightly less efficient for 6.21_scFv (DAR = 5.3) and 6.21_Fab (DAR = 5.1). In contrast, the monomeric purity of the 1.0_Fab conjugate was rather low (76.7%) and a substantial amount of low molecular weight species (LMW, 23.3%) was present, indicating a low stability of this conjugate.",

This is known as the bystander effect, and in antibody-drug conjugate design, it is important to limit this effect to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Enzyme-labile linkers were also created, which link a drug to an antibody via a peptide linkage. The free drug can be cleaved from the antibody-drug conjugate through lysosomal proteases, which are present in tumors. Linkers must be stable in circulation until the conjugate reaches the desired target cell to reduce the number of side effects a patient can experience from premature cleavage of the payload. \n\nThe most stable of the linkers in use today are the non-cleavable linkers. With this type of linker, the drug is released through internalization of the antibody-drug conjugate, which is quickly followed by degradation of the antibody component in the lysosome. This causes the release of the drug with the linker attached. Similar to the enzyme-labile linkers, the specificity of the antibody-drug conjugate has led to a decrease in the bystander effect. When the released drug is charged, it is less able to diffuse into adjacent antigen-negative cells. Unlike cleavable linkers, which may be released despite being poorly internalized, a non-cleavable linker only becomes active when it is internalized and degraded within the cell. With the variations of linkers available, one can select the best linker option after considering the response needed to create a specific delivery system to target the tumor cells [18].",

            "text": "The advancement of self-immolative linker chemistry has also improved the stability and tolerability of ADCs utilizing cleavable linkers. In the early 1980s, the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolate linker chemistry was developed by Carl et al. for use in prodrug design [196]. Since then, the PABC linker type has been extensively utilized in ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADC. Upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes after ADC internalization into the target cells, the PABC spacer in the vc-PAB-MMAE linker/payload goes through a cascade of disassembly reactions and facilitates the release of untethered MMAE intracellularly [197]. The vc-PABC linker exhibits superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profile compared to the earlier cleavable linker generations, such as the pH-sensitive hydrazone linker used in calicheamicin-based ADCs or disulfide reducible linker used in DM1-based ADCs [198]. This linker technology has achieved significant success with its application in four MMAE-ADCs out of the twelve approved ADCs. In addition, the PABC spacer also has been used in the development of PBD-based ADCs, including the approved ADC loncastuximab tesirine. Recently, Pillow et al. have developed sophisticated self-immolative spacer chemistry that enabled direct conjugation of a cytotoxic payload to engineered cysteine residues [30]. This spacer facilitates a stable disulfide bridge, leading to enhanced plasma PK while allowing a rapid traceless release of free payloads intracellularly. This technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to the conventional peptide-PABC linker technology [199]. In this study, both the conventional peptide-ADC and the self-immolative disulfide-ADC displayed similar in vivo potency.",

            "text": "Solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis is a well-established example of automated modular molecular synthesis. This technology enables the programmable assembly of oligonucleotides by the iterative addition of nucleoside phosphoramidites on resins. 1 In addition to nucleosides, other small molecules can also be covalently attached to oligonucleotides in high yield through solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry. These welldefined oligonucleotide-small molecule conjugates combine the functionality of small molecules with the sequencespecific target recognition of nucleic acids, expanding their potential practical uses. [9][10] In general, linkers between oligonucleotides and small molecules are non-cleavable and provide a stable connection. However, for oligonucleotide-drug conjugates in which small-molecule drugs or ligands must be conditionally released after entering the target cells, cleavable linkers are needed between the two entities. 11,12 leavable linkers are molecules that join two functional moieties through a scissile bond. 13 5][16][17] This enables the controllable release of a payload which can provide precision medicines and reduce side effects. However, commonly used cleavable linkages in the oligonucleotides field such as photocleavable (PC) and disulfide linkers have drawbacks for in vivo applications. These include the very limited tissue penetration of ultraviolet light and the poor stability of disulfide linkers during circulation in blood. Inspired by the cathepsin B-sensitive dipeptide linkers used in FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), [18][19][20] we recently reported the development of a Val-Ala-02 dipeptide linker phosphoramidite for the automated synthesis of enzyme-cleavable oligonucleotides Fig. 1a. 21 In the Val-Ala-02 structure p-aminophenylethanol, instead of self-immolative p-aminobenzyl alcohol, was conjugated to the dipeptide moiety.",

Currently, the valine-citrulline (Val-Cit), phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys) and valine-alanine (Val-Ala) peptides are the most widely employed cathepsin B cleavable linkers due to their high stability in serum and efficient drug release toward the lysosomes of target cancer cells [93]. For instance, a Val-Cit linker with MMAE is used in brentuximab vedotin and polatuzumab vedotin for targeting CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma and CD79b-positive R/R DLBCL, respectively [94,95]. Another ADC drug loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl, composed of anti-CD19 mAb conjugated with cytotoxin PBD through peptide linker Val-Ala, has been approved for the clinical treatment of large B-cell lymphoma [96,97]. Similar to cathepsin B, newly designed enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as the phosphatase cleavable linker, sulfatases cleavable linker, \u03b2-galactosidase cleavable linker and \u03b2-glucuronidases cleavable linker, have also emerged as effective linkers for drug conjugations (Figure 2).",

            "text": "In the scope of this review, we will consider any means of connection to the recognition moiety and a cytotoxic agent as a linker for convenience. \n\nFor antibody-and peptide-conjugated drugs, linkers could be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable subgroups. \n\nCleavable linkers in conjugated drugs are developed for the cytotoxic drugs to be released upon cellular uptake of the drug conjugate, which reduces off-target drug release with associated unwanted toxicity in healthy tissues [114,115]. In general, there are three main triggers for linker cleavage and drug release for conjugated drugs: acid-cleavable linkers undergo degradation and drug release due to the usage of the difference between pH levels in plasma (approx. pH 7.4) and endosomal/lysosomal compartments of the tumor cells [116,117] that could be as low as pH 4.5-4.7 [118]; enzyme-cleavable linkers are being cleaved upon internalization in the endosomal or lysosomal compartment of the cell based on the linker structure, with help of intracellular cathepsin B and beta-glucuronidase enzymes [119][120][121][122], and redox-sensitive disulphide linkers undergo reductive cleavage based on the difference in the number of reducing equivalents in the form of glutathione between the plasma (2-20 \u00b5M/ L) and cytoplasm (0.5-10 mM) [123]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers in the conjugated drugs require retention of the drug activity upon degradation of the recognition moiety within the endosomal compartment of the cells while the linker or its part stays intact. The advantage of using such types of drugs is associated with a decreased chance of off-target effects, as the drug is more likely to transform to its active form only upon internalization to the cells of interest [124][125][126]. \n\nAdditionally, the delivery system used in nanoformulations targeted against pathological cells could also be considered as a linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the recognition part of the drug.",

            "text": "Most methods that use a multifunctional linker strategy leverage established conjugation chemistries from singlepayload ADC development, alongside existing antibody expression systems. Typically, these approaches involve attaching an adapter to address steric hindrance at conjugation sites, particularly when interchain thiols serve as primary conjugation handles. By using adapters, the process can better accommodate the effects of large linker payloads on conjugation kinetics, especially when enzymes are the primary conjugation agents. The versatility of a library of multifunctional adapters, combined with an array of linker payloads, offers flexibility for developing varied ADC designs. This modular approach enables the creation of diverse total DAR and payload ratio profiles, catering to different research and therapeutic needs. As an alternative, direct chemical synthesis of multifunctional linker payloads reduces the number of conjugation steps, potentially streamlining the process. Depending on the drug developer's resources, technical expertise, and specific objectives, both the multifunctional adapter and multifunctional linker payload methods offer adaptable paths for customized drug design. Each approach can contribute to optimizing drug efficacy and targeting precision through strategic adjustments in DAR and payload distribution. \n\nThe combination of one non-canonical amino acid with cysteine, the utilization of two non-canonical amino acids, as well as a branched multifunctional linker payload, has demonstrated the ease of manufacturability and the feasibility of achieving desirable DARs. Additionally, the combination of one non-canonical amino acid with cysteine and the combination of two non-canonical amino acids allow for robust finetuning the DAR and the ratio of the two payloads, which is critical for optimizing the synergy of the two MOAs. By carefully evaluating these factors, ADC developers can select the most suitable methods to achieve effective dual conjugation and to optimize the pharmacologic properties of dual-payload conjugates. \n\nIn summary, the selection of a precise dual-payload conjugation method involves careful consideration of multiple criteria, including process complexity and compatibility with existing single-payload conjugation processes, linker payload MOAs, and antibody production platforms.",

            "text": "Although there have been extensive research and progress on the discovery of anticancer drug over the years, the application of these drugs as stand-alone therapy has been limited by their off-target toxicities, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and low therapeutic index. Targeted drug delivery, especially drug conjugate, has been recognized as a technology that can bring forth a new generation of therapeutics with improved efficacy and reduced side effects for cancer treatment. The linker in a drug conjugate is of essential importance because it impacts the circulation time of the conjugate and the release of the drug for full activity at the target site. Recently, the light-triggered linker has attracted a lot of attention due to its spatiotemporal controllability and attractive prospects of improving the overall pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. In this paper, the latest developments of UV- and IR-triggered linkers and their application and potential in drug conjugate development are reviewed. Some of the most-well-researched photoresponsive structural moieties, such as UV-triggered coumarin, ortho-nitrobenzyl group (ONB), thioacetal ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde (TNB), photocaged C40-oxidized abasic site (PC4AP), and IR-triggered cyanine and BODIPY, are included for discussion. These photoremovable linkers show better physical and chemical stabilities and can undergo rapid cleavage upon irradiation. Very importantly, the drug conjugates containing these linkers exhibit reduced off-target toxicity and overall better pharmacokinetic properties. The progress on photoactive antibody\u2013drug conjugates, such as antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) and antibody\u2013photoabsorber conjugate (APC), as precision medicine in clinical cancer treatment is highlighted.",

            "text": "They may not release drugs into the extracellular space and cannot kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect [18]. Furthermore, optimal linker selection depends on the chosen target antigen. Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in plasma, but rapidly release the active drug within lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes [19]. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence recognized and cleaved by these proteases. The primary goal of all linkers in ADCs is to ensure the specific release of the active drug within target cells, which is essential for controlling the toxicity of the highly potent drugs used to construct ADCs. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity changes for the above-mentioned linkers. Moreover, the ideal linker chemistry choice ultimately depends on experimentally determining the optimal combination of the suitable linker, the ideal target antigen, and the desired payload [20,21]. A comprehensive understanding of the structural integrity of the linker, the payload and the conjugation site during biological exposure is crucial throughout the process of novel linker-payload design and optimization of the PK profile [22]. This understanding represents a key aspect in maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity in preclinical testing and it is essential for ensuring the successful translation to the clinical setting [23,24]. \n\nThis bioconjugate modality's complexity is a source of significant challenge for analytical investigation and analysis, especially in vivo [25]. Nowadays, both Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Liquid Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have been employed to support ADC discovery and development projects [26,27]. Ligand-binding assays (LBAs) are considered the golden standard to measure antibody concentration (both total and conjugated antibody analytes), whereas LC-MS methods are usually employed to quantify both free and conjugated toxin [28,29].",

            "text": "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

            "text": "Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and Small Molecule-Drug Conjugates (SMDCs) represent successful examples of targeted drug-delivery technologies for overcoming unwanted side effects of conventional chemotherapy in cancer treatment. In both strategies, a cytotoxic payload is connected to the tumor homing moiety through a linker that releases the drug inside or in proximity of the tumor cell, and that represents a key component for the final therapeutic effect of the conjugate. Here, we show that the replacement of the Val-Ala-p-aminobenzyloxycarbamate linker with the Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-p-aminobenzyloxycarbamate (GPLG-PABC) sequence as enzymatically cleavable linker in the SMDC bearing the cyclo[DKP-isoDGR] \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin ligand as tumor homing moiety and the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as cytotoxic payload led to a 4-fold more potent anti-tumoral effect of the final conjugate on different cancer cell lines. In addition, the synthesized conjugate resulted to be significantly more potent than the free MMAE when tested following the \u201ckiss-and-run\u201d protocol, and the relative potency were clearly consistent with the expression of the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin receptor in the considered cancer cell lines. In vitro enzymatic cleavage tests showed that the GPLG-PABC linker is cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, and that the released drug is observable already after 15 min of incubation. Although additional data are needed to fully characterize the releasing capacity of GPLG-PABC linker, our findings are of therapeutic significance since we are introducing an alternative to other well-established enzymatically sensitive peptide sequences that might be used in the future for generating more efficient and less toxic drug delivery systems.",

            "text": "In the design of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs), linkers play a pivotal role. They not only ensure the stable binding between the antibody and the active payload, preventing premature release of the payload, but also significantly influence the pharmacokinetics (PK), therapeutic index, and safety of the drug (Jain et al., 2015). Based on their structure and functionality, linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable types. Cleavable linkers are sensitive to the intracellular environment and can be cleaved under specific conditions, such as the action of proteases or in low pH environments, leading to the release of cytotoxic molecules. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require proteolytic degradation of the ADC's antibody portion to release the active payload (von Arx et al., 2023). \n\nT-DM1 is composed of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab, a non-cleavable thioether linker N-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1carboxylate (MCC), and a potent microtubule-depolymerizing maytansinoid derivative, DM1 (55). Its drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is 3.5 (56). \n\nT-Dxd is constructed by conjugating trastuzumab with a cleavable tetrapeptide linker maleimide glycine-glycinephenylalanine-glycine (GGFG) and the Topo I inhibitor exatecan (Yu et al., 2022). The enhanced therapeutic efficacy of T-Dxd may be attributed to its higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR: 7-8), the unique cleavable GGFG peptide linker, and the superior membrane permeability of the Dxd payload. These attributes confer DS-8201a with a stronger bystander effect against nontargeted cancer cells (Xu et al., 2019). The structure and mechanism regarding T-DM1, T-DXd are summarized in Figure 1.",

A highly cytotoxic drug is covalently attached to an antibody that directs it to cancer cells. The conjugation of the drug-linker to the antibody is a key point in research and development as well as in industrial production. The consensus is to conjugate the drug to a surface-exposed part of the antibody to ensure maximum conjugation efficiency. However, the hydrophobic nature of the majority of drugs used in antibody-drug conjugates leads to an increased hydrophobicity of the generated antibody-drug conjugates, resulting in higher liver clearance and decreased stability.\n\n\nMethods\nIn contrast, we describe a non-conventional approach in which the drug is conjugated in a buried part of the antibody. To achieve this, a ready-to-click antibody design was created in which an azido-based non-canonical amino acid is introduced within the Fab cavity during antibody synthesis using nonsense suppression technology. The Fab cavity was preferred over the Fc cavity to circumvent issues related to cleavage of the IgG1 lower hinge region in the tumor microenvironment.\n\n\nResults\nThis antibody design significantly increased the hydrophilicity of the generated antibody-drug conjugates compared to the current best-in-class designs based on non-canonical amino acids, while conjugation efficiency and functionality were maintained. The robustness of this native shielding effect and the versatility of this approach were also investigated.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis pioneer design may become a starting point for the improvement of antibody-drug conjugates and an option to consider for protecting drugs and linkers from unspecific interactions.",

In contrast, the non-cleavable linker has better stability in plasma. For the payload to be released, the entire antibody-linker must be degraded by the lysosome, which usually results in charged amino acids remaining. By doing so, it impairs the action of the protein or the permeability of cells (41). At present, the most commonly used non-cleavable linker is a succinimide-thioether bond, which is usually coupled with maytansinoid derivatives DM1 and auristatin (17). The most representative ADCs are T-DM1 and depatuxizumab mafodotin, the former is coupled with DM1, and the latter is prepared by coupling with monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF). However, the succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) linker used in T-DM1 has a retro-Michael elimination reaction, which leads to reduced efficacy of ADC (42). In response to the problems of previous linkers, scientists have been working this year to develop new linkers and conjugation technology to improve the efficacy of ADCs. New chemical triggers (cBu trigger, silyl ether trigger, TRX trigger, photo-responsive cleavable triggers, and bioorthogonal cuttable trigger) are already being developed, which improve the selectivity in tumor delivery. Compared to the previous conjugation technology (conjugated in random variable positions), the new site-specific conjugation technology has a well-defined drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), which reduces ADC heterogeneity and improves the therapeutic window (43).",

            "text": "The linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

This study introduces an exolinker approach, repositioning the cleavable peptide linker at the exo position of the p-aminobenzylcarbamate moiety, as an advancement over conventional linear linkers. This design, which incorporates hydrophilic glutamic acid, addresses the limitations of the Val-Cit platform and improves the ADC in vivo profiles. In vitro and in vivo evaluations showed that exolinker ADCs reduced premature payload release, increased drug-to-antibody ratios, and avoided significant aggregation, even with hydrophobic payloads. Furthermore, the payload remained stably attached to the ADC even in the presence of enzymes like carboxylesterases and human neutrophil elastase, indicating the potential for a favorable safety profile.",

These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

            "text": "In summary, a cathepsin B-cleavable Val-Ala(NB) phosphoramidite monomer has been developed for the efficient automated synthesis of oligonucleotide-small molecule conjugates. Cathepsin B releases small molecule-phosphate derivatives from oligonucleotides which are converted to the free small molecules by cellular phosphatase enzymes. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we have shown that the microtubule destabilizing reagent combretastatin A-4 (CA4) is released from an oligonucleotide after intracellular cathepsin B and phosphatase mediated cleavage of the dipeptide in lysosomes where cathepsin B largely localizes. To broaden the scope of the methodology to molecules that do not contain hydroxyl groups, we have carried out the solid-phase conjugation of small molecules containing amino groups to oligonucleotides via the Val-Ala(NB) linker by carbamate formation. Overexpression of cathepsin B is associated with cancer and cathepsin B-sensitive peptides are widely used as cleavable linkers for the traceless release of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates, e.g. DS-8201 and Adcetris. With this in mind, our results will encourage applications in the parallel field of therapeutic oligonucleotides for the traceless release of siRNA or ASOs from nanocarriers, targeting agents and molecules that promote cell uptake.",

Thus, we remodeled two antibodies (HER2targeting trastuzumab and CD30-targeting brentuximab) with either UDP-1 or UDP-3 to give a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of azidosugarremodeled antibodies. All four azido-antibodies were subsequently conjugated with either linker-drug 4 or linker-drug 5 (see Supplementary Figure S9-S11). Both linker-drugs comprised bicyclononyne (BCN) 26 for metal-free click conjugation, our earlier reported 8 polar spacer technology based on carbamoyl sulfamide (HydraSpace\u2122, green), a short PEG spacer, and either maytansine or MMAE tubulin inhibitor payload (Figure 4a).

            "text": "An effective delivery system should release the payload once it reaches the target. Different strategies have been adapted to link a bioactive moiety to the peptide to ensure its effective release. PDCs for targeting specific cells usually consist of a peptide carrier, a chemical linker and a payload. Stable and low-molecular weight linkers are a critical part of the conjugate that, in concert with peptide and drug, maintain the structural integrity of the conjugate during circulation and play a significant role in delivering the drug to its targeted site (Ma et al. 2017). Different types of linkers and their encompassing release strategies are shown in Fig. 2.\n\nLinkers can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable based on the nature of their cleavage site. Cleavable linkers can be enzyme-sensitive, pH-sensitive, and glutathione sensitive whereas non-cleavable linkers include very stable amide, carbon or ether chain, that works best with the drugs not affected by post-chemical modifications with the linker molecule. Although, cleavable linkers are preferred for targeted therapeutics; however, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in terms of in vivo metabolic cycling (Fu et al. 2022).\n\nIn a PDC, payload can be conjugated to a carrier molecule via hydrolyzable linker such as carboxylate ester or stimuli-responsive linker (Poreba 2020;Hoppenz et al. 2020;Alas et al. 2021). In order to exploit the selectivity as well as potential efficacy of the payload, linker molecules are designed in such a way that the payload is selectively cleaved and released from the PDC once it reaches the target cell to avoid the off-target hydrolysis. One such example of selective linker is Ala-Ala-Asn tripeptide linker which is cleaved by Legumain, a cysteine protease having high substrate specificity overexpressed in solid tumors. Another protease that is often overexpressed in cancer lesions is Cathepsin B. Among Cathepsin B (lysosomal protease) sensitive peptide linkers, initially Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly and Ala-Leu-Ala-Le",

            "text": "ADCs are the fastest growing biopharmaceutical drugs because they embrace the specificity of antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small-molecule drugs. However, drug conjugations often deteriorate the molecular characteristics of ADCs. It is still challenging to develop ADCs by using efficient and manageable method. These hurdles limit further ADC development. \n\nHere, we sought to develop a simple and efficient methodology for drug conjugation that maintains the molecular characteristics of ADCs. In this method, three components-An antibody, peptides, and payloads-are conjugated in two chemical steps. In the first conjugation, the peptide and antibody are rapidly conjugated under mild conditions. Through the second conjugation, the payloads are coupled to the peptide via a click reaction. The peptide conjugation method has a series of advantages. Various payloads can be conjugated to antibodies, and their number can be controlled. Since the conjugation reaction is highly site-specific, and proceeds spontaneously, the structural modifications (such as reducing disulfide bonds) of the antibody are not necessary. Thus, the conjugation reaction produced a few byproducts. Cleavable linkers, such as peptide linkers, or disulfide linkers, which are often used to design ADCs, undergo deconjugation in the serum, resulting in off-target cytotoxicity 32 . In contrast, the amine coupled linker used in this study was non-cleavable and highly stable 33 . This conjugation method will allow the development of highly efficient and manageable ADCs. \n\nThe peptide/DOTA-conjugated trastuzumab exhibited enhanced ADCC compared to the non-conjugated trastuzumab. The decreased molecular dynamics (entropy) of the conjugated trastuzumab contributed to the enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIa. The mechanism underlying this effect is that the conjugated peptide induces Fc to be in a pre-optimized (well-prepared) state for the Fc\u03b3RIIIa binding, resulting in a thermodynamically favorable binding. \n\nThe ADCC enhancement due to the peptide conjugation did not interfere with the effect of afucosylation.",

            "text": "Additionally, they offer enhanced plasma safety and greater resistance to proteolysis compared to cleavable linkers. Recent advancements have given rise to non-cleavable linkers, notably the SMCC (Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) linkers and MD (Molecular Dynamics) linkers, which are currently in development. The hydrophilic nature of linker plays a pivotal role in diminishing nonspecific uptake or off-target toxicity of payload. SMCC linkers incorporate a cyclo-nucleic acid ring that reduces the antibody conjugate's hydrolysis rate at high pH levels, thus bolstering stability while preserving antibody specificity. On the other hand, MD linkers substitute the cyclo-nucleic acid ring of SMCC linkers with 1,3-dioxolein, enhancing linker hydrophilicity and stability due to the presence of two oxygen atoms within the 1,3-dioxolein ring (Figure 4). Notably, the current ADCs technologies making use of this approach include Kadcycla \u00ae (Basel, Switzerland) [44][45][46]. proved Hodgkin's lymphoma drug brentuximab vedotin using an CD30 antibody with a peptide cleavable linker and MMAE [39]. Furthermore, various enzyme-based linkers, such as \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b2-galactosidase linkers, have been developed [40][41][42][43] (Figure 4). These are degraded by enzymes present in lysosomes, rendering them more stable in the bloodstream compared to chemically cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers, which remain intact within the lysosome post-internalization and do not undergo degradation, lead to antibody degradation by lysosomal peptidases. This, in turn, results in the release of payload and triggers cytotoxicity, causing cell death (Figure 3).",

            "text": "30Kc19 is a multifunctional protein with properties of increasing the yield of soluble protein expression, enzymestabilizing, and cell-penetrating effects [29]. In this study, we fused the 30Kc19 with ASNase to increase its activity through enhancing stability of the protein. Moreover, cleavage linker was additionally applied to this fusion protein. Cleavage linker enabled to separate ASNase from fusion protein, and thus ASNase with reduced steric hindrance had improved anti-cancer efficacy. \n\nStructural perturbation is the major concerns for fusion protein design. The lack of structural space could interfere with protein function [42]. A cleavable linker can be applied to a wide range of cancer types due to their ability to separate and release functional cargo proteins from the fusion protein [43]. Cleavable linkers can be categorized as chemicalcleavable or enzyme-cleavable, and exploitation of specific conditions can lead to release of the therapeutic protein at the target cell [44]. For the chemically cleavable linkers, acid cleavable linkers, reducible disulphide linkers, and cleavable by exogenous stimuli linkers are available. As for enzyme cleavable linkers, they can be used to be selectively cleaved intracellularly, and dipeptide-containing linkers, glycosidasecleavable linkers, phosphatase-cleavable linkers are available for selective cargo release at the tumour site. \n\nIn this study, the cancer specific cleavable linker sequenced as PLGLAG was selected for separating ASNase and 30Kc19 near to cancer cells. In a previous study, dendrimeric nanoparticles coated with activatable cell penetrating peptides containing PLGLAG as linker were used because of its predominantly sensitivity to MMP-2 and MMP-9 [45,46]. We also maximized the effect of ASNase by using PLGLAG cleavable linker for targeting of MMP-abundant leukaemia cells [36][37][38].",

They usually consist of dipeptides cleavable by lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, typically abundant in cancer cells. Nine of the approved ADCs include enzyme-labile linkers, mostly based on the well-established cathepsin-sensitive valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) dipeptide, used to construct the chimeric anti-CD30 antibody-MMAE conjugate, or brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris \u00ae ). Alternative cathepsin-responsive dipeptides usually employed in ADC design are alaninealanine (Ala-Ala), phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), or valine-alanine (Val-Ala) sequences. Other common protease-activated linkers targeting lysosomal enzymes rather than cathep-sins include \u03b2-Galactosidaseor \u03b2-glucuronidase cleavable linkers [2,25,32,43,44]. Usually, due to the bulky nature of the payload, a para-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) selfimmolating spacer is also included in the linker moiety to facilitate enzyme access to the cleavage site. This unit further increases linker stability and allows straightforward payload release thanks to its self-cleavage capacity. Accordingly, enzyme-sensitive linkers provide a more precise release of the drug in the tumor milieu while also offering enhanced systemic stability than the chemical labile type due to their inertia at physiological conditions and protection by serum protease inhibitors [2,25,32,43,44].",

An ideal linker should possess high water solubility, preventing both aggregation of the ADC and premature payload release in systemic circulation (39). Regarding intracellular stability and degradation patterns, linkers are classified into two distinct categories: cleavable and non-cleavable (40). Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (40). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers undergo cleavage only within lysosomes, leading to the degradation of their associated payloads into amino acids (65). Significantly, non-cleavable linkers offer the benefits of an enhanced therapeutic index and reduced off-target toxicity (66). While each strategy presents its own advantages and drawbacks, the optimal linker and conjugation chemistry must be precisely tailored to align with the specific properties of the antibody, the drug molecule, and the disease profile being targeted.",

            "text": "Based on this, they developed the GlycoConnect coupling technology, which can use natural glycosylation sites to achieve site-specific coupling [148]. The technique is based on 2 processes: first, enzyme remodeling (modification and labeling with azide), and then the linking of payloads based on copper-free click chemistry. The monoclonal antibody can be converted into a stable conjugated ADC in just a few days. MedImmune, a division of AstraZeneca that develops ADC drugs, has developed a family of ADC drug candidates through the CuAAC click chemical link. In the series of ADC candidate drugs, monoantimicrobials targeting HER2/neu (a member of the EGFR family) are modified with an azide group, and auristatin F (a cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor) is modified with a terminal alkyne (Fig. 19B) [149]. This technology has been expanded to generate fully functional and highly stable ADCs that exhibit optimized pharmacokinetic, biological, and biophysical properties. \n\nThe development of ADCs has advanced substantially in the past decade, driven by improvements in payloads, linkers, and coupling techniques [150,151]. Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles [151,152]. Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance [153]. The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors [154]. However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms [155]. Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156].",

Among the advantages of using a linker are preventing premature drug release, improving the liberation of the active drug at the target, and facilitating stability in the production process. The most important aspect of the linker is its physicochemical properties, which allows defining two main different kinds of linker: \n\nCleavable linker: It is characteristic of breaking one of its chemical bonds that binds the two molecular entities. This kind of linker has been successful in elaborating ADCs due to its stability in the synthesis process and the blood circulation of the conjugate for a long time. It allows the releasing of the drug under some conditions at the surrounding of the target cell or tissue-like overexpression of enzyme or acidic environment (Lu et al., 2016;Ramos Tomillero, 2016;Kostova et al., 2021). \n\nNon-cleavable linker: Its principal function is to maintain links between biomolecule and drug. This feature represents a more significant advantage over cleavable linkers because it has more excellent stability in the plasma, thus increasing the specificity. The drug will not be released outside the target cells because the mAb degradation is carried out within the lysosome (McCombs and Owen, 2015;Ramos Tomillero, 2016;Kostova et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers, including thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MC) types, offer significant advantages due to their stable chemical bonds, which prevent proteolytic cleavage and contribute to reduced off-target toxicity. These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugation has gained significant momentum during the past few years with more than ten antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) being approved by regulatory agencies for cancer treatment in clinics [1][2][3][4][5]. As hybrid molecules containing biologics and highly toxic low-molecular weight chemotherapeutic drugs, ADCs leverage the advantages of both targeting specificity of antibodies and high potency of cytotoxic compounds or synthetic cytotoxins. To synthesize ADCs, the antibodies are coupled with drug-linkers using different conjugation chemistries. The therapeutic index of the ADCs depends on many attributes including the expression profiles of selected cancer antigens, the qualities and specificities of antibodies, the properties of the synthetic cytotoxins (potency, mechanism of action, loading, cleavable or non-cleavable linkers), and the conjugation chemistries used [6]. The conventional conjugation approaches rely on non-specific/stochastic coupling of drug-linkers to lysines (about 40 residues per IgG1) or hinge cysteines (8 residues per IgG1). They often result in a heterogeneous profile of ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2 or 4, leading to difficulties in characterization and process control. To overcome these disadvantages, next generation site-specific antibody-drug conjugation methods have been developed. These methods have been reviewed in many excellent publications [7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. \n\nIn addition to using synthetic cytotoxins, there is increased interest in coupling other payloads with site-specific antibody conjugation. These payloads include non-cytotoxic compounds that are not cytotoxic to human cells, as well as proteins/peptides, glycans, lipids, and nucleic acids. The review herein highlights the progress in site-specific conjugation of these payloads other than synthetic cytotoxins to antibody molecules after presenting a brief overview of advances in developing next generation antibody conjugation methods.",

Non-cleavable linkers, being the most stable type, generally result in better tolerability, but ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate superior efficacy, partly attributable to the bystander effect. 14 The payload typically consists of a highly potent small molecule with nanomolar to picomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The payloads of FDA-approved ADCs for solid tumors currently fall into three classes: microtubular inhibitors (auristatins, maytansinoids), topoisomerase inhibitors (deruxtecan, SN-38-active form of irinotecan), and alkylating agents (duocarmazine). 15 The drug-antibody ratio (DAR) refers to the average number of drug molecules conjugated to an antibody in an ADC. \n\nIt is a critical parameter in ADC design, influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the conjugate. A higher DAR may increase the drug payload, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy, but it could also impact stability and increase the risk of off-target effects. On the other hand, a lower DAR may provide better stability but may limit the overall drug payload. Finding the optimal DAR is crucial in ADC development to balance therapeutic benefits and potential challenges. 16 ADCs were first approved for hematologic malignances (lymphoma, multiple myeloma), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. 17 Among gynecological cancers, mirvetuximab soravtansine has been recently approved by the FDA for relapsed platinum resistant ovarian cancer. 17 ncerning CC several targets are under evaluation, but TF is the most investigated.",

This click linker is stable in the circulatory system because the drug was conjugated through an amide/peptide bond to the linker. Proteolysis of amide/peptide bonds is naturally catalyzed by intracellular enzymes predominantly in lysosomes (Yang et al., 2023). The concentration of proteolytic enzymes in the circulatory system is extremely low. \n\nHence, the MLN8237 conjugated by the amide bond is stable in the circulatory system. The TCO-and Tz-functionalized 5D3(PEG 4 -TCO) 5 and MLN8237-Tz undergo rapid, catalyst-free click chemistry. This reaction occurs with a kinetic rate ranging from 2 \u00d7 10 3 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 M \u22121 s \u22121 under physiological conditions, driven by inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) conjugation chemistry (Blackman et al., 2008). Remarkably, this process produces only non-toxic N 2 as a byproduct, without any crossreactions with other functional groups. Additionally, pegylation of the linker enhances water solubility and biocompatibility of the resulting conjugate (Veronese and Mero, 2008). These advantages position our approach favorably compared to the common uncleavable heterobifunctional MCC linker chemistry for antibody-drug conjugation. 5D3(CC-MLN8237) 3.2 was labeled with suitable fluorophores for in vitro or in vivo imaging. We conjugated only 1-2 fluorophores per antibody.",

The frequently used enzymatically cleaved TEV-linker contains a peptide sequence, which is recognized by Tobacco Etch Virus nuclear inclusion A peptidase, which is orthogonal to trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage -two most commonly used proteases [109]. Multiple modifications to the peptide sequence and linker structure were consecutively introduced by the Cravatt lab including the 'light' and 'heavy' derivatives containing stable isotopes enabling the quantification and direct comparison between the conditions [80]. The disadvantage of the TEV-linker might be the multistep synthesis. The labile and open search of the publicly available data revealed a set of diagnostic ions, both derived from the linker and the probe (Figure 10A and B). The structural motives of the diagnostic ions corroborate the above-described findings. The fragmentation of the triazole ring leaving the primary amine and b-ion resulting from the fragmentation of the TEV-recognition peptide sequence. The chemical cleavage of the linker to release probe-peptide conjugates is achieved mainly by the change of the pH or via reducing conditions to release acid, base, or redox-labile parts of the linker [52]. Most recently, Wozniak et al. mapped the binding sites of a large small molecules library, which were equipped with a photocrosslinker [110]. The study used the acid-cleavable dialkoxydiphenylsilane (DADPS) linker to release the probe-peptide conjugates (Figure 11A). The crucial advantage of the study was the introduction of a search algorithm considering generation of the chimeric spectra. The chimeric spectra may include fragmentation of multiple probe-peptide conjugates which differ only in the position of the probe-peptide covalent bond. Thus, the physicochemical properties are highly similar as well as the mass of the conjugate leading to coelution from LC and cofragmentation during MS/MS.",

            "text": "Additionally, there have been developments in antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), which combine these monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic drugs to augment the potency of targeted anticancer treatments [4]. \n\nADCs represents a cutting-edge anticancer drug with a specific mechanism of inducing cell death in cancer cells. This drug comprises three essential components: an antibody, a payload, and a linker. Its structure entails an antibody that binds to the target substance's epitope, a payload responsible for causing cell death, and a linker that connects the antibody to the payload. ADCs offer a significant advantage due to their monoclonal antibodies ability to selectively target and act on cancer cells, thereby reducing non-specific toxicity to healthy cells. Linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release payloads into cancer cells, triggering cell death by exploiting the pH difference between cancer cells and normal cells. Non-cleavable linkers, although their exact mechanism remains unknown, release payloads through enzymatic degradation of lysosomes in targeted cancer cells. There are primarily two types of payloads in use: DNA-targeted and microtubule-targeted payloads. DNA-targeted payloads bind to the DNA of cancer cells, disrupting its structure and leading to cell death. On the other hand, microtubuletargeted payloads disrupt microtubules within cancer cells, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Creating an ADCs involves the conjugation of an antibody, linker, and payload. This can be achieved by utilizing amino acids present on the antibody's surface or through artificial modification of the antibody surface. Two critical factors influencing the stability of an ADCs are the number of payload drugs conjugated to the antibody and the conjugation site of the antibody and linker. The modulation of these factors can be categorized into stochastic conjugation and site-specific conjugation methods [5]. \n\nThe inception of the first generation of ADCs dates back to the mid-20th century, but they grappled with limitations such as inadequate control over drug binding sites on antibodies, reduced efficiency, and undesirable side effects.",

Similar to cathepsin B, newly designed enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as the phosphatase cleavable linker, sulfatases cleavable linker, \u03b2-galactosidase cleavable linker and \u03b2-glucuronidases cleavable linker, have also emerged as effective linkers for drug conjugations (Figure 2). On the other hand, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is found to be highly expressed on the surface of neoplastic plasma cells and plays a critical role in the proliferation, survival and tumor progression in multiple myeloma (MM). Recently, an anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody was designed to conjugate with MMAE through a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl (MC) linker to synthesize a BCMA-targeted ADC (e.g., belantamab mafodotin-blmf) for multiple myeloma treatment [106]. \n\nIn the light of these successes, aptamer-drug conjugates can be more easily synthesized by using these linkers and payloads due to their superior chemical properties. Zhang et al. conjugated a nucleolin target aptamer (named AS1411) with paclitaxel (PTX) through a cathepsin B-labile dipeptide linker Val-Cit [75]. As the aptamer is highly water soluble, this conjugate dramatically improved the water solubility of PTX and specifically delivered PTX into nucleolin-positive ovarian cancer cells through nucelolin-mediated micropinocytosis, resulting in notable improvement of antitumor activity and reduction of systemic toxicity. The same linker was also used for the conjugation of MMAE and MMAF with aptamers targeting EGFR or transferrin [78].",

            "text": "The biological molecules known as linkers used in ADCs are for the linkage between the antibody and the warhead. Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a therapeutic modality that aims to improve payload delivery specificity and reduce systemic toxicity. Considering the complex structure of ADCs, various bioanalytical methods by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), ligand binding assay (LBA) and hybrid LBA-LC-MS approaches have been established for ADC characterization and quantification. LCMS-based assays enable drug-antibody ratio (DAR) sensitive quantification of the conjugated payload. Typically, for quantitative, DAR-sensitive, assessment by LC-MS/MS,the conjugated payload is enzymatically liberated and quantified. Despite recent advances in ADC bioanalytical methods, the DAR-sensitive quantification of noncleavable linker ADCs by LC-MS/MS remains challenging. Thus, we developed a novel digestion-free middle-down mass spectrometry (DF-MDMS) using a collision-induced dissociation approach for absolute quantification of conjugated payload from four different ADCs in a biological matrix with minimum sample preparation. These results demonstrate that ADCs with different linker-payload structures can be quantified, including a noncleavable linker ADC, trastuzumab emtansine. It also shows that the assay sensitivity is comparable to the conventional ADC quantification method by linker-payload cleavage using enzyme, while the assay dynamic range depends on factors including payload ionization and dissociation efficiency, DAR and its distribution, and species abundance. By demonstrating absolute quantification of both cleavable and noncleavable linker ADCs, this novel middle-down ADC approach demonstrates its potential application in bioanalysis and analytical characterization, especially for early discovery where high-throughput screening is required as the new approach saves time and resources by not requiring enzymatic digestion for cleavable ADCs or development of anti-payload antibodies for noncleavable linker ADCs.",

            "text": "Linkers are the most important and intricate part in the development of a successful ADC, since they form the link between the therapy and antibody. Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,56,57]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers.",

            "text": "The linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the la er might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a noncleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Sitespecific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

            "text": "Each of the final candidates (AntiSCV2P1, AntiSCV2P7, AntiIAVP2, and AntiIAVP7) has the potential to be developed as an entry inhibitor therapeutic by itself. We put forth the idea of creating an in vivo cleavable peptide-peptide conjugate from both AntiSCV2 and AntiIAV categories. Inserting an in vivo cleavable linker between an AntiSCV2 and an AntiIAV peptide will prolong the plasma half-life of the complex compared to the individual components and preserve the bioactivity of each domain without hindrance for the other peptide (Chen et al. 2013). One strategy for designing in vivo cleavable linkers are protease-sensitive linkers. These linkers use sequences that are liable to specific proteases in the human body. The oligopeptide nature of the in vivo cleavable protease-sensitive linker makes the whole construct's production as a recombinant peptide in an expression host feasible. At the same time, the complications of the chemical conjugation method can be avoided. The linker can be sensitive to one of the proteases present in the bloodstream. Some of the linkers from this category previously employed are factor XIa/FVIIa, factor Xa, and thrombin-sensitive linkers (Goyal and Batra 2000;Park et al. 2012;Schulte 2009). This leads to the rapid destruction of the linker in the blood circulation. \n\nIn a different strategy, the enzymatically cleavable linker is the substrate of a specific protease overexpressed under one particular pathological condition or in a specific organ. Designing conjugates with these linkers can be applied to site activation of biotherapeutics in targeted locations. TMPRSS2 is a transmembrane serine protease expressed in the alveolar epithelium. This enzyme plays an essential role in the SCV2 and influenza fusion process by priming the S protein and hemagglutinin, respectively (Shen et al. 2020). Inhibitors of this enzyme are also considered AntiSCV2 and anti-influenza drug candidates.",

Through balancing selective targeting molecules with highly potent payloads, drug conjugates can target specific tumor microenvironments and kill tumor cells. A drug conjugate consists of three parts: a targeting agent, a linker, and a payload. In some conjugates, monoclonal antibodies act as the targeting agent, but new strategies for targeting include antibody derivatives, peptides, and even small molecules. Linkers are responsible for connecting the payload to the targeting agent. Payloads impact vital cellular processes to kill tumor cells. At present, there are 12 antibody-drug conjugates on the market for different types of cancers. Research on drug conjugates is increasing year by year to solve problems encountered in conjugate design, such as tumor heterogeneity, poor circulation, low drug loading, low tumor uptake, and heterogenous expression of target antigens. This review highlights some important preclinical research on drug conjugates in recent years. We focus on three significant areas: improvement of antibody-drug conjugates, identification of new conjugate targets, and development of new types of drug conjugates, including nanotechnology. We close by highlighting the critical barriers to clinical translation and the open questions going forward. Significance Statement The development of anticancer drug conjugates is now focused in three broad areas: improvements to existing antibody drug conjugates, identification of new targets, and development of new conjugate forms. This article focuses on the exciting preclinical studies in these three areas and advances in the technology that improves preclinical development.",

            "text": "Numerous dipeptide sequences have been described as enzyme-sensitive, and many of them have been used in the context of RGD-targeted compounds. The most popular might be the Val-Cit sequence, known to be a substrate of cathepsin B that results in intracellular cleavage. It has often been used in combination with a PABC (para-aminobenzyl carbamate) spacer to allow traceless release, as in the commercialized brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris \u00ae ) antibody-drug conjugate preferentially releasing MMAE to CD30+ cells [71], as well as to release a cryptophycin-55 glycinate drug from a monomeric RGD ligand [72]. Alternatively, Val-Cit-Gly-Pro has been used, where the Gly-Pro dipeptide was meant to decompose by diketopiperazine formation in order to release the drug in a traceless fashion [72,73]. It is worth noting that, despite the widespread of Val-Cit-PABC linkers, recent work indicated that cathepsin B could actually be useless for linker cleavage, instead carried out by other cysteine proteases [74]. If Val-Cit-PABC proves efficient for many triggered release applications, underlying mechanisms might need to be clarified. The Val-Ala dipeptide is another sequence particularly employed to design cleavable conjugates targeting integrin \u03b1V\u03b23. It has notably been introduced in linkers in combination with a PABC self-immolative spacer to trigger lysosomal traceless release of cryptophycin from RGD and isoDGR ligands [75], as well as traceless release of PTX, auristatin derivatives (MMAE or MMAF), and \u03b1-amanitin from DKP versions of cycloRGD and isoDGR, respectively [76][77][78].",

            "text": "Antibody\u2013drug Conjugates (ADCs) are a powerful therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. ADCs are multi-functional biologics in which a disease-targeting antibody is conjugated to an effector payload molecule via a linker. The success of currently used ADCs has been largely attributed to the development of linker systems, which allow for the targeted release of cytocidal payload drugs inside cancer cells. Many lysosomal proteases are over expressed in human cancers. They can effectively cleave a variety of peptide sequences, which can be exploited for the design of ADC linker systems. As a well-established linker, valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyl carbamate (ValCitPABC) is used in many ADCs that are already approved or under preclinical and clinical development. Although ValCitPABC and related linkers are readily cleaved by cathepsins in the lysosome while remaining reasonably stable in human plasma, many studies have shown that they are susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma, which hinders the preclinical evaluation of ADCs. Furthermore, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, two of the most commonly observed dose-limiting adverse effects of ADCs, are believed to result from the premature hydrolysis of ValCitPABC by human neutrophil elastase. In addition to ValCitPABC, the GGFG tetrapeptidyl-aminomethoxy linker is also cathepsin-cleavable and is used in the highly successful ADC drug, DS8201a. In addition to cathepsin-cleavable linkers, there is also growing interest in legumain-sensitive linkers for ADC development. Increasing plasma stability while maintaining lysosomal cleavability of ADC linkers is an objective of intensive current research. This review reports recent advances in the design and structure\u2013activity relationship studies of various peptide/peptidomimetic linkers in this field.",

            "text": "To improve the efficacy of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), there has been significant focus on increasing the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in order to deliver more payload. However, due to the hydrophobicity of many cytotoxics, highly-loaded conjugates often have lower physicochemical stability and poorer pharmacokinetic outcomes, requiring the development of new hydrophilic linkers. Herein, we report a platform for the preparation of functional, sequence-defined polymers for conjugation to antibodies. We demonstrate the successful synthesis of novel diazido macrocyclic sulfate monomers of varied size ranging from 4 to 7 ethylene glycol repeat units. These monomers were then successively ring-opened to produce sequence-defined polymers that contained either 4 or 6 azides for post-synthesis functionalization. Given the hydrophilic ethylene glycol backbone and chemically defined nature of the polymers, we envisioned this as a useful strategy in the preparation of highly-loaded ADCs. To demonstrate this, we prepared a model polymer-fluorophore scaffold composed of 4 coumarin molecules and conjugated it to Herceptin. We fully characterized the conjugate via mass spectrometry, which yielded a polymer-to-antibody ratio of 6.6, translating to a total of 26 fluorophores conjugated to the antibody at the inter-chain disulfides. We believe this technology to not only be a meaningful contribution to the field of sequence-defined polymers and conjugates, but also as a general and tunable platform for drug delivery.",

            "text": "Synthesis of ApDCs depends on several vital research areas including the choice of an appropriate antigen target, discovery of novel, highly potent cytotoxic drugs and conjugation technology [87,88]. Importantly, the major approach for the synthesis of ApDCs is to utilize appropriate chemical linkers as a bridge to connect the aptamers and cytotoxic payloads through covalent bonds, which are key components for ApDCs to control the release of payloads to blood cancer cells, expressing the target antigen rather than to healthy cells, as shown in Figure 1B [89]. In brief, linkers require high stability in the circulation so that the payload stays connected to the aptamers when it is distributed to the tissue. Once ApDCs are precisely internalized and transported into cellular organelles of cancer cells, the linkers release the attached cytotoxic drug through the dissociation properties. Upon release, the cytotoxic drug can interfere with various cellular mechanisms, eventually leading to cell death. \n\nSince the development of ADC drug construction, different types of linkers have been well established for the conjugation of biomacromolecules and chemical compounds. Additionally, given their dissociation properties, linkers can be divided into two categories, cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are designed to be easily cleaved enzymatically (e.g., cathepsin B, etc.) or chemically (e.g., acid-sensitive linkers and reduction-sensitive linkers), leading to the release of their payload in targeted cells [90]. Among them, cathepsin B cleavable linkers/peptide linkers are commonly used in ADCs for various payloads, including MMAE, MMAF, pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD) and doxorubicins (DOX) [91,92].",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51].\n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) [51,52].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to",

            "text": "Abstract--Drug conjugates, including antibodydrug conjugates, are a step toward realizing Paul Ehrlich's idea from over 100 years ago of a \"magic bullet\" for cancer treatment. Through balancing selective targeting molecules with highly potent payloads, drug conjugates can target specific tumor microenvironments and kill tumor cells. A drug conjugate consists of three parts: a targeting agent, a linker, and a payload. In some conjugates, monoclonal antibodies act as the targeting agent, but new strategies for targeting include antibody derivatives, peptides, and even small molecules. Linkers are responsible for connecting the payload to the targeting agent. Payloads impact vital cellular processes to kill tumor cells. At present, there are 12 antibody-drug conjugates on the market for different types of cancers. Research on drug conjugates is increasing year by year to solve problems encountered in conjugate design, such as tumor heterogene-ity, poor circulation, low drug loading, low tumor uptake, and heterogenous expression of target antigens. This review highlights some important preclinical research on drug conjugates in recent years. We focus on three significant areas: improvement of antibody-drug conjugates, identification of new conjugate targets, and development of new types of drug conjugates, including nanotechnology. We close by highlighting the critical barriers to clinical translation and the open questions going forward.\n\nSignificance Statement--The development of anticancer drug conjugates is now focused in three broad areas: improvements to existing antibody drug conjugates, identification of new targets, and development of new conjugate forms. This article focuses on the exciting preclinical studies in these three areas and advances in the technology that improves preclinical development.",

Here, we propose a simple and reliable synthetic procedure for such conjugates. all modifications and homogeneity). However, there are some shortcomings associated with low stability in the bloodstream because nucleic acids are not adapted to function under such conditions. Even so, the problem of plasma stability has been overcome for antisense oligonucleotides using carbohydrate and phosphate modifications [52]. \n\nIn this paradigm, the aptamer serves as the delivery vehicle, but the efficiency of internalization of the aptamer-receptor complex remains unclear. As such, we set out to synthesize conjugates of different architectures, including multivalent constructs that may be capable of inducing EGFR clustering, which has been shown to promote internalization [53]. In general, multimerization has been found to be a useful approach to improving the specificity and affinity of aptamers [54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61].

For example, the payloads for oncology ADCs (oADC) can be derived from natural sources, including the microtubulin inhibitors monomethyl auristatin A MMAE [114], monomethyl auristatin F MMAF [115], mertansine, DNA binder calicheamicin [116], topoisomerase 1 inhibitor SN-38 [117], and exatecan [118]. \n\nChemical motif-defined linkers include disulfides, hydrazones, peptides (cleavable), or thioethers (non-cleavable). Cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have proven safe in preclinical and clinical trials. The anti-microtubule agent monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE, a synthetic antineoplastic agent, is delivered to human-specific CD30-positive malignant cells by the enzyme-sensitive cleavable linker in the drug compound brentuximab vedotin. By preventing the polymerization of tubulin, MMAE prevents cell division. MMAE cannot be utilized as a single-agent chemotherapeutic medication due to its severe toxicity. However, the stability of MMAE attached to an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is unaffected by extracellular fluid. Trastuzumab emtansine combines the microtubuleformation inhibitor mertansine (DM-1) and antibody trastuzumab, which uses a noncleavable stable linker [119]. \n\nDue to the availability of newer and more robust linkers, the function of the chemical bond has changed. The linker's cleavable or non-cleavable nature determines the cytotoxic medication's characteristics. A non-cleavable linker, for instance, retains the medicine inside the cell. As a result, the entire antibody complex-including the linker and the cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agent-enters the cancer cell that is being targeted, where the antibody is broken down into an amino acid.",

            "text": "The linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

            "text": "Chemotherapy is still one of the main therapeutic approaches in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, its poor selectivity causes severe toxic side effects that, together with the development of drug resistance in tumor cells, results in a limitation for its application. Tumor-targeted drug delivery is a possible choice to overcome these drawbacks. As well as monoclonal antibodies, peptides are promising targeting moieties for drug delivery. However, the development of peptide\u2013drug conjugates (PDCs) is still a big challenge. The main reason is that the conjugates have to be stable in circulation, but the drug or its active metabolite should be released efficiently in the tumor cells. For this purpose, suitable linker systems are needed that connect the drug molecule with the homing peptide. The applied linker systems are commonly categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Both the groups possess advantages and disadvantages that are summarized briefly in this manuscript. Moreover, in this review paper, we highlight the benefit of oxime-linked anthracycline\u2013peptide conjugates in the development of PDCs. For instance, straightforward synthesis as well as a conjugation reaction proceed in excellent yields, and the autofluorescence of anthracyclines provides a good tool to select the appropriate homing peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these conjugates can be used properly in in vivo studies. The results indicate that the oxime-linked PDCs are potential candidates for targeted tumor therapy.",

            "text": "Despite the significant development of drugs along with the novel treatment methods available in clinical cancer therapy, the prevalence of cancer still remains to be a formidable challenge, and huge obstacles are there to be solved. The increasing risk of toxicity on patients and limited therapeutic window are the major problems in the current chemotherapies. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in order to effectively address these issues. \n\nDrug conjugate or prodrug is one of the most successful approaches for these strategies, using various linkers to mask the activity of the drug and connect with drug carrier and targeting agents, which effectively increase the selectivity of the drugs and, very importantly, improve the ADME properties to subtly circumvent all sorts of difficulties of the complex biological system to deliver the potent payload at the right place and at the right time. Linker, as its name implies, is the structural hub for assembly of the other essential components for becoming a complete pro-drug and also plays a significant role in practice to release the payload. \n\nIn recent years, photocleavable linkers have been developed as a non-invasive technology, allowing the controlled release of the active substance with high spatiotemporal precision. Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies. This orthogonal release approach, which has demonstrated its potential from previous applications, will be further explored in future research.",

Currently, there are 13 FDAapproved ADCs: six ADCs are approved for solid tumor cancers, and seven are approved for hematologic malignancies (Table 2). ADCs have been on the US market for over a decade with the first antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, receiving FDA approval for acute myeloid leukemia in 2000; however, the majority of ADCs have been approved within the last five years. ADCs are comprised of three components (Fig. 1) which are integral to the overall efficacy and safety of the drug. The first component is a monoclonal antibody that is highly selective for a tumor-associated antigen that has low to no expression on other tissues. The second component is the drug conjugate also known as the payload, which is typically a conventional chemotherapy agent that causes cell death after cell internalization and payload release. Commonly used drug conjugates include anti-microtubule inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and DNA intercalating agents. These are extremely potent compounds that cannot be safely given outside of the ADC system. The last component is the linker, which attaches the monoclonal antibody and the drug conjugate together. The linker maintains the stability of the drug conjugate to the monoclonal antibody in the systemic circulation but it can efficiently release the payload within the target cell. Off-target, off-tumor effects or toxicities may occur as a result of linker degradation or instability in systemic circulation. Linkers can be cleavable or non-cleavable, which relates to the release mechanism. Cleavable linkers release their conjugate in a physiologically optimal environment such as low pH or high glutathione concentrations. Non-cleavable linkers form bonds with amino acid residues on monoclonal antibodies, and as a result, are more stable in the bloodstream. Non-cleavable linkers depend on lysosomal degradation of the monoclonal antibody in lysosomes.",

If the payloads are released systemically prematurely, the efficacy of the remaining circulating ADCs may be reduced, leading to off-target toxicity.

These linkers reduce payloads release during circulation and off-target toxicity. \n\nSilencing the Fc portion of the ADCs. Whereas the Fc domain of the antibody induces immunogenicity, the internalisation of ADCs into non-targeted cells via Fc\u03b3 receptors on immune cells may provoke off-target toxicities. By silencing the Fc domain, Fc-mediated offtarget cytotoxicity was reduced (48). \n\nNovel site specific conjugation technologies. Conventional antibody conjugates have been constructed through cysteine or lysine residue side chains. These approaches were stochastic, non-specific conjugation and generated heterogenous ADCs. To overcome the drawback of non-specific conjugation, intense research to realise site specific conjugation has been conducted. Chemo-enzymatic methods include transglutaminase and glycan-mediated conjugation, and chemical methods include selective reduction of disulfides and N-terminal amine modifications (49).",

However, current methods for their construction still suffer from a number of shortcomings. For instance, using a single modification technology to modulate the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) in integer increments while maintaining homogeneity and stability remains exceptionally challenging. Herein, we report a novel method for the generation of antibody conjugates with modular cargo loading from native antibodies. Our approach relies on a new class of disulfide rebridging linkers, which can react with eight cysteine residues, thereby effecting all-in-one bridging of all four interchain disulfides in an IgG1 antibody with a single linker molecule. Modification of the antibody with the linker in a 1\u2009:\u20091 ratio enabled the modulation of cargo loading in a quick and selective manner through derivatization of the linker with varying numbers of payload attachment handles to allow for attachment of either 1, 2, 3 or 4 payloads (fluorescent dyes or cytotoxins). Assessment of the biological activity of these conjugates demonstrated their exceptional stability in human plasma and utility for cell-selective cytotoxin delivery or imaging/diagnostic applications.",

The maleimide-linker drug can then exchange onto circulating free cysteines, such as that of albumin [37]. Premature release of payload in circulation through deconjugation results in decreased amounts of drug delivered to the tumor, limiting efficacy of the ADC and increasing the likelihood of off-target toxicity. This instability can be avoided by hydrolysis of the maleimide after the formation of the thiosuccinimide, which results in ring opening and an irreversible linkage. This can be accomplished through high pH and high-temperature incubation of the ADC after conjugation [37], or through the use of \"self-hydrolyzing\" maleimides [38]. Maleimide stability can also be modulated by the choice of attachment site, as maleimide stability is conjugation-site-dependent, with thiol pKa and solvent accessibility having a direct impact on propensity for deconjugation and hydrolysis [39,40].\n\nAdvancements in linker design are key contributors to the clinical success of ADCs. Linkers must be able to keep the cytotoxic payload stable in plasma, but then must also facilitate rapid and efficient release of the active drug in tumor cells. Both cleavable and noncleavable linkers have been successfully employed in approved ADCs ( Table 1). Payloads that require release of the unmodified free drug upon internalization in the tumor cell to maintain drug potency require a cleavable linker. Cleavable linker technologies most widely used are reducible disulfides, acid labile-hydrazones, and protease cleavable dipeptides [10]. Upon internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis, ADCs enter the endosomal to lysosomal pathway, where they are exposed to changing cellular conditions. The acidic environment of the late endosome promotes drug release from pH-sensitive hydrazone linkers, while disulfide linkages are cleaved by reduction due to the high concentration of glutathione present in tumor cells [10]. One of the earliest linkers, the acidlabile hydrazone link",

Thus far, the design of the most promising tubulysin payloads relied on simplifying their structures, e.g., by using small tertiary amide N-substituents (Me, Et, Pr) on tubuvaline residue. Cumbersome solution-phase approaches are typically used for both syntheses and functionalization with cleavable linkers. p-Aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium (PABQ) linkers were a remarkable advancement for targeted delivery, but the procedures to incorporate them into tubulysins are only of moderate efficiency. Here we describe a novel all-on-resin strategy permitting a loss-free resin linkage and an improved access to super potent tubulysin analogs showing close resemblance to the natural compounds. For the first time, a protocol enables the integration of on-resin tubulysin derivatization with, e.g., a maleimido-Val-Cit-PABQ linker, which is a notable progress for the payload-PABQ-linker technology. The strategy also allows tubulysin diversification of the internal amide N-substituent, thus enabling to screen a tubulysin library for the discovery of new potent analogs.

These will be discussed further in this review. We primarily focus on the linkers utilized for enrichment and identification of the probe-protein conjugates resembling probe-protein interaction in native conditions in living cells. Taken together, the linkers used in chemical proteomics workflows are applied broadly in many research areas including screening of fragment libraries, covalent modifiers, protein PTMs, protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and indeed NP-protein interactions, but they share many common features, which are of interest of this review (Figure 2C) [5,52]. These chemical linkers bridge an imaginative gap between the crude, highly complex, and structurally diverse cell or tissue lysates containing unknown probe-protein conjugate(s) and the desired analytical output with the information about the protein and conjugate identity.

Conjugates were stored in lyophilized form at \u00c020\u00b0C until reconstitution, after which CL2A conjugates were either discarded within one hour or flash frozen and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C until future use. hRS7 antibody was conjugated to AlexaFluor680 (AF680, Fisher Scientific) for biodistribution, plasma clearance, and tumor digest experiments as previously described via NHS ester chemistry to obtain a final degree of labeling of approximately 0.3 to prevent changes in distribution upon conjugation of dye (23). For experiments involving dual fluorescent labels, the antibody was stably labeled with AlexaFluor488 (AF488, Fisher Scientific), while SN-38 component of CL2A-SN-38 was stably labeled with near IR dye, AF680, at the drug's 10-hydroxy position. CL2A-SN-38-AF680 was conjugated to reduced AF488-hRS7 by the standard thiol-maleimide chemistry (details provided in Supplemental Information).",

            "text": "Another important linker, which is used in the AAC under clinical evaluation, is the cathepsin B-responsive linker (Lehar et al., 2015). Cathepsin B is a lysosomal protease that is overexpressed in numerous cancer cells and bacterial infections (Gondi and Rao, 2013). It cleaves preferentially certain sequences, such as phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys) and valine-citrulline (Val-Cit). Upon internalization of the AAC, the antibiotic is released in the lysosomes in a traceless manner. This linker has been one of the most successful cleavable linkers for ADCs. Another promising cleavable linker is the glutathione sensitive linker. This strategy takes advantage of the higher concentration ratio of glutathione between the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment (Mills and Lang, 1996). In circulation, the disulfide bond is highly stable. However, upon internalization, the presence of high amounts of glutathione cleaves the disulfide bond and releases the free payload (Saito et al., 2003). Pyrophosphate diester linker has demonstrated a higher aqueous solubility and circulatory stability than traditional linkers. Upon internalization, the pyrophosphate diester gets quickly cleaved the linker through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway to liberate the payload (Kern et al., 2016). Finally, quaternary ammonium salt linker is also applied. This strategy was designed to take advantage of a novel connection to tertiary amines (Pillow, 2017). These tertiary amines are commonly found in numerous anticancer drugs and antibiotics (Dan et al., 2018;Kostova et al., 2021). So far, the approach relies on the removal of a methyl group to connect the linker, which might affect the stability and efficacy of the drug. This new strategy allowed developing potent ADCs and AACs, with increased stability of the conjugates.",

            "text": "Introducing cleavable linkages into optimized systems often alters activity profiles, while chemical building blocks used in conjugations may prove incompatible with the intricacies of biological systems, leading to discouraging outcomes in clinical trials. Additionally, maintaining the activity of biomolecules such as antibodies, cargo, proteins, and fluorescent tags is particularly challenging. Determining the optimal linker length is another obstacle, as it directly impacts the proximity and likelihood of ligand-target interactions. Lastly, both the designed systems and their by-products may pose toxic effects on living cells, raising critical safety concerns. \n\n-Similarly, Section 7-Future Perspective should be summarized after emphasizing promising key areas as bulleted paragraphs while figuring out their potential impacts in those fields. \n\nResponse: Thank you for the valuable suggestion. We have carefully rewritten section 5 (Challenges) in the revised manuscript as follow: \n\nAs we advance toward personalized and targeted healthcare, the future of biochemically cleavable conjugations offers immense promise for transforming biomedicine. In targeted drug delivery, conjugation strategies designed to respond to specific molecular disease signatures could enable highly effective and personalized treatments for conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections. In the realm of personalized medicine, a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms is poised to integrate biochemically cleavable conjugations into individualized treatment plans, enhancing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse reactions. \n\nAdvanced imaging and diagnostics stand to benefit from conjugates with biochemically cleavable linkers that remain inactive until encountering specific biological triggers, improving specificity, reducing background noise, and enabling non-invasive, highly sensitive disease detection. The emergence of multimodal imaging agents capable of detecting multiple disease markers may further facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Theranostics, which merges therapeutic and diagnostic functionalities into a single entity, is another area of promise, as biochemically cleavable conjugations can enable real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy while delivering therapeutic agents to target sites. This approach allows clinicians to make data-driven decisions, optimizing treatment regimens based on patient responses. Finally, innovative conjugation strategies in combination therapies could enable precise and sequential drug release, improving treatment outcomes and reducing drug resistance.",

            "text": "In recent years, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have gained attention as a promising area of research in cancer therapy. A complete PDC consists of a peptide, a linker, and a payload that covalently binds the peptide molecule to the small molecule drug through the linker [64]. \n\nTo be effective, PDCs need to meet the condition of not releasing the drug prematurely during circulation and only releasing it at the tumor site. The choice of linker is crucial, as it not only ensures the stability of the PDC during circulation but also enhances the efficiency of cytotoxic drugs in killing tumor cells [65]. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable categories based on their stability in the body and the mechanism of cleavage at the tumor tissue. Cleavable linkers can further be divided into three types: enzyme-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive linkers [9]. For instance, Liu et al. proposed a novel doxorubicin peptide-drug conjugate (DOX PDC) that utilized a homodimeric HER-2 targeting peptide covalently conjugated with an acid-sensitive hydrazone bond to enhance tumor targeting ability and anticancer activity. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this PDC effectively delivered DOX into HER2-positive SKBR-3 cells, significantly improving anticancer efficacy and reducing the side effects of DOX [66]. This research provides a new targeted delivery strategy for developing stable PDCs for anticancer therapy. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers such as thioethers, oximes, and triazoles do not undergo cleavage. These linkers rely on lysosomal/endosomal degradation after internalization of the drug conjugate to activate the drug. For instance, Yu et al. connected a cell-permeable peptide (Kip-related protein, (KRP)) with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) through sulfide and amide bonds, resulting in a KRP-DOX conjugating. This conjugating was intravenously injected into mice with osteosarcoma.",

            "text": "The goal of research with the antibody conjugate is to find a proper linker to construct an antibody-prodrug conjugate that is able to deliver the drug part to the decease site. In 2000, the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) Gemtuzumab ozogamicin-Mylotarg \u00aewas approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ADC has a complex structure, encompassing recombinant antibodies that specifically bind to specific receptors, releasing the active drug at the tumor site. For example, IKS03 is a CD19-targeting antibody-drug conjugate with a novel linker-payload design for tumorselective release. Using farnesyltransferase-catalyzed ConjuALL technology, IKS03 achieves site-specific conjugation to a DNA cross-linking agent, resulting in a homogeneous ADC with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2. To minimize systemic release of the potent payload in human plasma, IKS03 incorporates a linker cleavable by the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase. The payload is a prodrug with a protecting moiety also cleavable by the same enzyme. Thus, after CD19-dependent binding and uptake, IKS03 requires intracellular lysosomal processing in the target cell to release and activate the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer payload, which induces DNA cross-linking, blocks DNA replication, and ultimately leads to tumor-selective cell death. IKS03 entered Phase I clinical trials in 2023. Figure 10 shows the antibody-drug conjugate scheme and Sacituzamab govitecan molecular structure, which was approved in USA in 2020 for treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Within the category of target-directed prodrugs, the high specificity is typically achieved by conjugation of popular drugs with the antibody, which serves as a vector to the target (for example, cancer cell). The challenges for the success of the system were the delivery of cytotoxic drugs from the conjugate into cancer cells.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have been investigated since the early-1980s [82] for their ability to deliver a therapeutic to a specific target and they represent one of the most solid approaches to improving the pharmacokinetics properties of toxic drugs. Their working mechanism is based on the identification of surface biomarkers that are overexpressed in abnormal cells, representing the target against which the antibody specificity is addressed. ADC technology is composed of three elements comprising the antibody, the drug and a linker connecting these two components [83]. The linker design enables drug targeting via antibody binding and, moreover, determines PK properties of the ADC. This phenomenon is very important to improve the therapeutic properties of drugs affected by fast clearance. Current research in the field is focused on generating antibodies with higher specificity and biocompatibility and improving current synthesis techniques to conjugate multiple therapeutics to the antibodies. However, much effort is also dedicated to developing degradable linkers to favor and control drug release. The first goal of the linker is to guarantee product stability in circulation. However, after reaching the target, the therapeutic molecule has to be released to avoid the unwanted accumulation of the curative payload in not optimal subcellular compartments [84]. In this context, it is important to highlight that if the drug is not released, it will accumulate in proximity to the cell membrane or, in the case of antibody receptor-mediated endocytosis, in the lysosomes. ADC characterized by non-degradable linkers rely on the degradation of the whole antibody to allow drug diffusion in the cytoplasm, but charged residues connected to the payload may hamper this phenomenon [85]. Lysosomal proteases represent an optimal trigger for drug release, and for this reason, the development of linkers sensitive to CtsB activity was extremely investigated. As extensively reported above, CtsB is overexpressed in many cancer cells, representing an additional mechanism of targeting. In addition, this protease can be secreted in the extracellular space favoring the release of the drug molecule, also from the non-internalized antibodies (Figure 3).",

            "text": "The cleavable Val-Cit linker is stable in circulation and overcomes the concern of the payload being released before it enters the tumour [53]. It is designed to release the payload after receptor-mediated endocytosis following cleavage of the linker by the enzyme cathepsin B [54]. The bystander effect is attributed to the hydrophobic properties of a payload allowing it to diffuse through the cell membrane as well as target nearby tumours, can be beneficial for cancers that have a low and heterogenous expression of the target antigen [7,53,[55][56][57][58]. The payloads were conjugated at a ratio of 2.83:5.25 VcMMAE/SMCC-DM1, respectively, to optimise the ADC design and due to the demonstrated benefits of incorporating a protease cleavable linker, MC-Val-Cit-PAB, also known as VcMMAE, that has the potential to effectively overcome acquired T-DM1 resistance and increase the sensitivity of the cells, making it a valuable addition to the ADC design [42,50]. Non-cleavable linkers such as SMCC are also very stable in circulation and are less prone to off-target toxicities [57]. A narrow therapeutic window usually arises from excess toxicity [59]. As MMAE is highly toxic at high drug loading, it has a high clearance rate in vivo and a narrow therapeutic window [37,57,60]. Because of this, MMAE has been used at a lower drug loading. Hence, we have incorporated a low drug loading of MMAE and a higher drug loading of DM1. \n\nThe GR 50 value declined significantly from 1967 nM to 0.29 nM upon conjugation of the antibody to both antimitotic agents, displayed in Figure 2A, compared to the Tmab (GR 50 = 1967 nM), Figure 2B. Colorimetric analysis using the Incucyte \u00ae cytotox green dye (Figures 4 and 5) shows cell internalization of our conjugate against SK-BR-3 and DLD-1 cells, respectively.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.",

            "text": "Diverse ADC properties are also impacted by linker chemistry, including specificity, stability, potency, and toxicity [21]. Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

            "text": "In the Val-Ala-02 structure p-aminophenylethanol, instead of self-immolative p-aminobenzyl alcohol, was conjugated to the dipeptide moiety. Val-Ala-02 shows excellent stability during DNA synthesis but cannot be used for the traceless release of payloads as the p-aminophenethyl group remains attached to the payload after enzymatic cleavage of the dipeptide. \n\nHerein, we overcome this problem by developing a novel traceless cleavable dipeptide linker phosphoramidite for the automated modular synthesis of oligonucleotide-small molecule conjugates. As shown in Fig. 1b, we synthesized a Val-Ala(NB) dipeptide phosphoramidite in which the dipeptide is protected by a photolabile 2-nitrobenzyl group to enhance its stability during DNA synthesis. After DNA synthesis, deprotection and photolysis, cathepsin B is able to cleave the Val-Ala dipeptide of oligonucleotide-payload conjugates. As a result, the payload-phosphate adduct is released, which is further converted to the dephosphorylated small molecule (free payload) by phosphatase enzymes. ODN7UV, a DNA conjugate with the microtubule destabilizing reagent combretastatin A-4 (CA4) attached via the Val-Ala linker, was delivered to HCT116 cells by lipofectamine. After transfection, we found a clear decline in cell viability which can be attributed to the release of CA4 via intracellular cathepsin B-mediated cleavage of the dipeptide. In addition, payloads containing an amino group can be conjugated to Val-Ala(NB) via a carbamate linkage through a two-step solid-phase process, expanding the general utility of Val-Ala(NB) phosphoramidite in the facile synthesis of oligonucleotide-small molecule conjugates.",

            "text": "The success of conjugation depends on the nature of the linkers used.It is complex to design a protein linker that breaks specifically in the brain to deliver an antibody conjugated [187] under certain conditions or in the presence of specific, prevalent, active enzymes in the brain environment.Linkers sensitive to enzymes or pH levels unique to the brain environment are referred.Many linkers can be cleaved by specific enzymes [188].Common examples include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or cathepsins, which might be more active in areas of inflammation or tumor growth within the brain.The brain's microenvironment might exhibit altered pH levels, especially in diseased states such as tumors.Linkers that degrade under acidic conditions could be engineered to release the antibody when they reach these areas.\n\nThe pH-sensitive linkers work based on the pH differences between the blood (pH ~7.4) and the intracellular environment within endosomes (~pH 5.5).Such linkers can remain stable in the bloodstream but cleave in the acidic environment of the endosomes within brain endothelial cells, releasing the antibody once inside the brain.One of the most used pH-sensitive linkers in drug conjugates is the hydrazone bond, which is stable at neutral pH but cleaves in acidic conditions (pH ~5.0 to 6.0).Acetal and ketal linkers are also stable at neutral pH but cleave in a tanacidic environment.Theo orthoester linkers are designed to undergo hydrolysis under mildly acidic conditions, making them useful for applications where a slightly earlier release before reaching the most acidic environments (like late endosomes or lysosomes) is beneficial.The \u03b2-thiopropionate linkers are designed to be cleaved by esterases, which can be activated or more accessible in different pH environments, adding another layer of specificity to the release mechanism.\n\nNoncleavable linkers can be particularly useful in applications where prolonged therapeutic agent retention is necessary or premature release could lead to toxicity or reduced efficacy [189].",

Chemotherapeutic compounds such as doxorubicin are conjugated to cleavable linkers sensitive to active serine proteases (104,105,(131)(132)(133)(134). For example, the FAP-cleavable GP linker and KLK3-cleavable SSKYQSL linker have been successfully used in prodrug approach. Antibody-drug conjugates that incorporate tumortargeting antibodies into protease-activatable prodrug format further enhance tumor-specific activation. A new technology termed as Probody masks antibody binding using linkers cleaved by extracellular proteases. EGFR Probody PB1 only binds EGFR following cleavage by matriptase, uPA, or legumain (125). \n\nWhile cancer immunotherapies have shown significant clinical outcomes, only a small subset of patients respond to the treatment, calling for reliable biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of the immunotherapy. Targeting the immunomodulatory, tumor stroma-associated serine proteases may provide a potential therapeutic option that complements and/or synergizes with the currently available immuno-oncology therapeutics. In cancer patients that high FAP expression in CAFs restricts T cell distribution and promotes immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) resistance (41,157,158), treatment with FAP inhibitor could neutralize the immunosuppressive function of CAFs and reverse anti-PD1 drug resistance. Conditional depletion of FAP + CAFs could result in enhanced T cell infiltration and better response to anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 treatment.",

            "text": "By using aptamer as the targeting agent, DOX-intercalated dsDNA can be specifically delivered to the targeted cancer cell, showing enhanced antitumor efficacy in the mouse model (Zhu et al., 2013). Another approach is to use cleavable or traceless cleavable linker chemistry, which enables the release of the natural product when it reaches the target cell (Br\u00e4se and Dahmen, 2000). The stimuli-responsive drug release strategies include the reduction of disulfide bonds by glutathione (GSH), light-induced cleavage, and enzyme-catalyzed cleavage (Beck et al., 2017). Figure 1F illustrates two commonly used, disulfide-based, traceless cleavage linkers, 4-nitrophenyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio) benzyl carbonate (NPDBC) and 4-nitrophenyl 2-(2-pyridyldithio) ethyl carbonate (NPDEC). Under the condition of high intracellular GSH concentration, the broken disulfide bonds lead to the cleavage of the amide bond, releasing the native MMC molecule from the aptamer strand with the secondary amine group intact (Yang et al., 2020). The use of a traceless linker to prepare conjugate not only prevents acid-mediated degradation of MMC but also enables tumor microenvironment-responsive drug release. In addition to the above-mentioned traceless release strategies, other types of traceless linkers, such as amide-containing linker (Shannon et al., 2003;Gil and Brase, 2004), sulfone-based chemistry (Cheng et al., 1999;Cheng et al., 2001;Huang T. et al., 2021), and aryltriazene (Hejesen et al., 2013), can also be easily applied to synthesize DNA-drug conjugates, enabling targeted release of native natural products.",

            "text": "The immense research effort put into ADC linker-payload design during the past decade has contributed to a sharp increase in regulatory approvals. However, ADC development still faces dose-limiting toxicity issues during clinical trials, which could be partly attributed to the systemic release of the payload and poor PK properties. The development of more stable linker systems in mouse and rat plasma would accelerate the preclinical evaluation of the ADC drug candidates. In particular, the identification of new peptide/peptidomimetic sequences will allow highly specific cleavage, which can greatly reduce premature cleavage of the linker at non-tumor sites, hence increasing the safety profiles of the ADCs. Obviously, the linker systems reviewed herein apply only to typical ADCs which rely on binding to an internalizing antigen and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the payload via lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless, recent years have also seen growing interest in developing an atypical class of ADCs targeting poorlyor non-internalizing antigens on cancer cells or components of surrounding tumor stroma. For these ADCs, the linkers are cleaved extracellularly within the tumor microenvironment to release the payload, which can then diffuse into nearby cancer cells for selective killing. However, the design of such linker systems is beyond the scope of the current review. The readers are advised to refer to an excellent recent review article by Ashman et al. for a comprehensive account on this topic [55]. In addition to linker design, site-specific conjugation using engineered antibodies and enzyme systems now enables the development of homogeneous ADCs with superior PK properties. The use of a site-specific conjugation method also allows for payload attachment at sites that can enhance systemic stability of the prepared ADCs. The use of improved linker-payload designs and highly active payloads in combination with site-specific conjugation chemistry will lead to more successes in the ADC field in the future.",

This innovation eliminates the need for additional adaptors commonly required in enzymemediated conjugation processes, thereby streamlining the workflow. Additionally, the technology leverages branched linker payloads, which further reduces procedural complexity and enables facile adjustments in DAR and the ratios of the two payloads. This adaptability enhances the versatility of conjugate design, allowing for the precise customization of payload ratios, which is especially beneficial in optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing off-target toxicities of ADCs.",

A way to circumvent moderate or inefficient internalization is to use an extra-cellular stimulus, such as an Asn-Pro-Val tripeptide sequence, a substrate of neutrophil-secreted elastase [80]. Very recently, a Gly-Pro-Ala tripeptide was used as a cleavable linker, to trigger a self-assembly that resulted in the tumoral accumulation of a so-called bioactivated in vivo assembly (BIVA) probe with a prolonged imaging window [81]. \n\nIn the realm of enzyme-sensitive linkers, the disulfide bridge is particularly widespread. It is simple, quite stable in circulation, and an easily amenable unit that allows lysosomal cleavage and payload release upon disulfide reduction by the excess glutathione (GSH) present in subcellular compartments. The use of a linear RGD ligand connected to an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe and a gemcitabine unit via a GFLG linker (substrate of cathepsin B) and a disulfide linker (substrate of GSH), respectively, resulted in a dual-responsive \u03b1V\u03b23-targeted theranostic compound [82].",

Chemically cleavable linkers are cleaved in organelles with acidic environments, such as lysosomes and endonucleosomes, while enzymatic cleavage linkers are cleaved by histone proteases and enzymes associated with the tumor microenvironment [9]. \n\nPeptides are the active sites and constituent fragments of enzymes, antibodies, and protein hormones and are defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as polymers consisting of \u226440 amino acid molecules [10]. Peptides have been widely utilized and developed due to their bio-compatibility, ease of synthesis and purification, high modifiability, and stability. Peptides coupled with drugs can be used in drug delivery system development and bio-pharmaceutical research, enhancing drug therapeutic strength and accuracy [11]. \n\nIn peptide-constructed DDSs, peptides can be used as carriers to deliver anticancer drugs to specific sites, improving the delivery ability of DDSs with certain physiological activity and chemical modification of side chain functional groups [12], including supramolecular nanostructures such as peptide nanocarriers. Importantly, peptide carriers enhance the penetration of drugs into target cells and the specific targeting ability of drugs, effectively solving the drug delivery barrier problems. Functional peptides exhibit the ability of functional units of peptides to covalently couple with drugs under the action of linkers to form PDC systems [13].

This paper specifically describes the target receptors of cell-targeting peptides, the uptake pathways of cell-penetrating peptides and different environment-stimulus-responsive peptides, as well as the promising applications of DDSs consisting of these functional peptides in the clinical treatment of diseases.",

In addition to a non-cleavable linker (DBCO-PEG 12 -NHS), a cleavable linker (DBCO-PEG 3 -S-S-NHS) was chosen to introduce a redox-labile disulfide bond that allows separation of the payload and the ligand after cellular internalization, which might be desirable for maximizing the activity of drugs. Because the UV/VIS spectroscopy could not accurately determine the quantity of linker per ligand due to their low concentrations, we verified the successful conjugation using SDS-PAGE. For this purpose, we treated K-EGF RR equipped with the DBCO linker with Cy5-azide, as the azide selectively reacts with the DBCO component of the linker. In the Cy5 channel, a distinct band at approximately 7.6 kDa is observed for each sample treated with varying equivalents of the linker (Figure 3). \n\nThe intensity of the K-EGF RR band increased in proportion to the number of linker equivalents used during the conjugation process. As expected, no band was detected in the Cy5 channel for the negative control, where Cy5-azide was added to the K-EGF RR without a linker (see Figure 3, lanes \"0 eq.\"). This absence of a band in the negative control indicates that the band in the samples treated with the linker results from the successful conjugation and is not a consequence of nonspecific interactions between the dye and the ligand.",

            "text": "Several considerations must be considered when selecting a linker to bind an antibody to transferrin to facilitate entry into the brain. First and foremost, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which molecules, including antibodies, can cross the BBB [73]. TfRs are one of the targets for transporting molecules across the BBB. Therefore, conjugating antibodies to transferrin can facilitate brain entry via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Secondly, the linker should be designed to be stable during circulation but cleavable in the brain milieu to release the antibody from transferrin. Various cleavable linkers, such as protease-sensitive or pH-sensitive linkers, can be considered [52,74]. Thirdly, the linker should maintain stability in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the antibodytransferrin conjugate. Stability can be influenced by factors such as serum proteases and pH [75]. \n\nAdditionally, the linker should be designed to be cleavable within the unique microenvironment of the BBB, which may have different enzymatic activities or pH compared to other tissues [76]. Once a linker design is proposed, it is crucial to validate its efficacy in facilitating brain entry and cleavage in preclinical models [77]. Optimization may be necessary to achieve the desired pharmacokinetics and brain distribution. Finally, assessing the safety profile of the linker and ensuring the specificity of brain targeting are important considerations to minimize off-target effects and potential toxicity [73]. \n\nThe pH-sensitive linkers play a crucial role in drug delivery systems, as they are designed to remain stable at physiological pH but become cleavable under acidic conditions typically found in endosomes or lysosomes. One example is hydrazone linkers, which form via the reaction between a hydrazide and a carbonyl group under acidic conditions. They exhibit stability at neutral pH but undergo hydrolysis in acidic environments, facilitating linker cleavage. This mechanism has been utilized in various drug delivery systems, including liposomes and polymer conjugates [78]. Another commonly used pH-sensitive linker is the acetal linker, which remains stable at neutral pH but undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to release the payload under acidic conditions.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the concept of an ADc is compelling, and hundreds of ADcs have been built, studied, and tested. Since Mylotarg's first approval, 15 ADcs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both solid and hematological cancers (table 1, Sasso et al. 2023)-including Mylotarg which returned to the market in 2017 with a lower suggested dose and a revised dosing schedule-and over 100 ADcs are currently in clinical trials, with more than 200 ADcs in preclinical development. \n\nwhat we have learned over two decades of research, is that each component of an ADc (the antibody, linker, and payload) confers pharmacokinetics and biodistribution properties that provide more on-target activity, but also a concomitant exposure to the rest of the body that results in off-target toxicities (colombo and Rich 2022; Sasso et al. 2023). to expand the therapeutic window, much research has been devoted to the development of cleavable and non-cleavable linkers that improve the stability, hydrophobicity, and specific release of the cytotoxic payloads. ideally, linkers are stable in circulation and release payload in cancer cells. to achieve this dual functionality, linkers with diverse release triggers have been developed including pH sensitive linkers, enzyme cleavable linkers (i.e. specifically cleaved by cathepsins, glycosidases, or sulfatases), and photo-sensitive linkers. the unique properties of these linkers convey functionality to ADcs, but an in-depth analysis of these is beyond the scope of this review (Su et al. 2021). in addition, a collection of different cytotoxins with various mechanisms of action and potencies have been used to reduce off-target effects (Beck et al. 2017). A critical consideration when designing an ADc is how protein engineering and the chemistry of conjugation can determine the individual components of the conjugate, and consequently, affect its overall stability, PK, efficacy, and safety. Here we discuss advances in protein engineering strategies and emerging technologies that are being developed to improve the functional properties of ADcs.",

The linker's cleavable or non-cleavable nature determines the cytotoxic medication's characteristics. A non-cleavable linker, for instance, retains the medicine inside the cell. As a result, the entire antibody complex-including the linker and the cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agent-enters the cancer cell that is being targeted, where the antibody is broken down into an amino acid. The resulting complex, which consists of an amino acid, a linker, and a cytotoxic agent, is regarded as an active medication. On the other hand, cleavable linkers are dissociated by cancer cell enzymes. The cytotoxic payload can then leave the targeted cell and destroy nearby cells through a process known as \"bystander killing\" [120]. \n\nAOCs, or antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, comprise two essential classes of macromolecules: monoclonal antibodies and oligonucleotides. With AOC, various applications, such as imaging, detection, and targeted therapeutics, have profited from the union of the diverse functional modes of oligonucleotides with the potent targeting properties of monoclonal antibodies. The fundamental obstacles to effective ON therapies are cell internalization and absorption. ADCs can be used to get around problems with administering and internalizing ON therapies. The bioconjugation process has been used to obtain several such conjugates. \n\nThe utility of ADCs and AOCs is limited to solid tumors because of the larger physical size (150 kDa) since the antibody size cannot be modified [121]. Therefore, nanobody-ON conjugates are intensively used to exploit the small nanobody size to reduce imaging displacement [122].",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

            "text": "For targeted therapy various drug-delivery systems are conjugated with proteins or peptides. In this case cytotoxic agent (payload) is connected to the tumor-targeting carrier via a cleavable (stimuli responsive) or non-cleavable linker. Tumor-targeting carrier may be an antibody, a protein, or a peptide and the resulting conjugates are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), protein-drug conjugates (PrDCs) and peptide-drug conjugates (PeDCs). A key factor, in the design of all these conjugates is the linker which influences the stability of the conjugate, modulates the release of the cytotoxic agent and the pharmacokinetics [232][233][234][235][236]. \n\nADCs with humanized antibodies showed low immunogenicity and better half-lives in comparison with ones with murine antibodies, but due to size and complex structure their use is somehow limited to hematologic malignancies and rarely to solid tumors. By means of PEGylation certain properties of anti-bodies can be modified (increased halflives and reduced immunogenicity). Nowadays there are twelve ADCs approved by FDA (starting with Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, more than two decades ago) [236][237][238][239]. \n\nPrDCs ensures improved pharmacokinetics, long blood residence and reduced toxicity by selective distribution in targeted cells. Physicochemical criteria are used to identify suitable proteins for conjugation. Several PrDCs (with albumin, transferrin, gelatin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, insulin, etc.,) are now in preclinical or clinical phases of clinical trials [236,[240][241][242][243][244].",

            "text": "Clinical approvals of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have seen a big leap in the past several years. In fact, 12 out of 15 ADCs on the market were approved from 2017 to 2022 [1,2]. More than 100 new ADCs are currently at various stages of clinical development, which reflects the huge potential of this class of medicines in cancer treatment. The mechanism of action of ADCs involves antibody binding to a specific antigen on cancerous cells and subsequent internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cancer cell, degradation of the antibody and/or cleavage of the linker in the endosomal-lysosomal compartments would release the drug payload, which then exerts its cytocidal effects in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Researchers have taken advantage of two important endosomal-lysosomal features in designing linker systems for drug release: (i) the acidic environment inside lysosomes for the design of acid-labile linkers, and (ii) the over-expression of specific lysosomal proteases for the design of protease-cleavable linkers (Figure 1A) [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Eight out of the fifteen approved ADCs have protease-recognizable peptide sequences in the linkers (Table 1), which are further attached to a self-immolated moiety. Upon cleavage of the peptide sequence by the protease, the self-immolated moiety peptide sequences in the linkers (Table 1), which are further attached to a self-immolate moiety. Upon cleavage of the peptide sequence by the protease, the self-immolated moiet readily undergoes elimination to release the free drug, which then defuses out of the ly sosomal compartment. Linker-payload optimization is one of the most critical tasks i ADC development.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted agents that link a cytotoxic drug (also known as payload) to a monoclonal antibody. The antibody recognizes an antigen on the tumor and releases the cytotoxic drug into the cell, thereby reducing toxicity and improving efficacy [20]. The cytotoxic drug and the antibody are joined by a connector (linker). The linker is a critical component in the structure of ADCs; there are two types, \"cleavable\" and \"non-cleavable\". Linkers have to remain stable in circulation and be easily cleavable in the intracellular space to deliver the payload. \"Cleavable\" linkers release the drug by hydrolysis or proteolysis. \"Non-cleavable\" linkers depend on degradation of the antibody to release their cytotoxic payload. The average number of drugs conjugated per antibody is known as the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and is an important feature of ADCs since it is relevant for potential efficacy and toxicity [21]. \n\nThe ADC-antigen complex is usually taken up by endocytosis or pinocytosis after binding to its target. An early endosome is created as a result of internalization by budding inward from the cell membrane. Before binding to lysosomes, early endosomes become late endosomes [21]. Cleavage processes of ADCs with cleavable linkers, such as hydrolysis, proteolytic cleavage or reductive cleavage, take place in early or late endosomes, but ADCs with non-cleavable linkers need sophisticated proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin B and plasmin in lysosomes. The cytotoxic payload is discharged from lysosomes to the cytoplasm after cleavage. Cytotoxic payloads target DNA and cause single-or doublestrand DNA breaks, or interfere with microtubules, leading to cell apoptosis [22].",

            "text": "an (Enhertu \u00ae ) and sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy \u00ae ) challenged this accepted doctrine, with both ADCs having close to eight drugs per antibody. Both of these conjugates employ topoisomerase inhibitors as their cell-killing agent, which have a lower potency and lower toxicity than previously approved ADC payloads [13]. Despite the high DAR of sacituzumab govitecan, this ADC does not suffer from rapid clearance, and increased drug load correlates with improved in vivo efficacy [32]. The use of hydrophilic linkers in the design of these ADCs helps them accomplish their high DAR without negatively affecting PK [13].\n\nSite-specific conjugation techniques have been developed to better control drug loading and to create homogeneous ADCs. The earliest and most notable platform is Genentech's THIOMAB\u2122 antibody technology, which uses engineered cysteines at specific sites in the antibody for uniform payload conjugation, leaving interchain disulfides intact. THIOMAB\u2122 antibodies can be engineered to contain two, four, or six free cysteines for chemical conjugation [33]. The resulting THIOMAB\u2122 antibody-drug conjugates have a high degree of homogeneity and improved TI over conventional ADCs [34]. Use of this technology requires thoughtful protein engineering and a high degree of sample processing to generate THIOMAB\u2122 antibodies that are properly assembled, with free cysteines available for conjugation [29]. A number of ADCs using cysteine-engineered antibodies have entered the clinic for both solid tumor and hematological malignancies, but we have yet to see the therapeutic potential of this strategy realized in an approved ADC.\n\nOther novel site-specific conjugation strategies have been developed for the production of homogeneous ADCs. A popular strategy that does not require protein reengineering of the antibody is disulfide rebridging. Disulfide rebridging uses bifunctional cysteine reactive linkers that attach to interchain disulfides, resulting in one drug attachment site per disulfide. Examples include Abzena's ThioBridge\u2122 and Sorrento's C-Lock\u2122, with the",

The traceless linker was the most potent (8-fold improvement in T cell proliferation), highlighting the importance of the selected linker in this strategy. Similarly, melanoma-specific antigens (TRP-1, TRP-2, gp100, and MART-1 derived peptides) with Cys at their C-terminus were conjugated to antibodies using the sulfhydryl-maleimide reaction [96]. In another example, strain promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry was used to synthesize an antigen-containing nanoconstruct [97]. TRP-2(180-188) was modified with azidovaleric acid via a PEG spacer at its N-terminus. In this construct, the antigen could not be released intracellularly because of the non-cleavable covalent bond (Figure 3c). A similar strategy was used to conjugate OVA (257-264), OVA(323-339), and M30 (PSKPSFQEFVDWENVSPELNSTDQPFL) [98]. First, the \u03b2-1,3-glucan particles were modified by epoxy-PEG 4 -N 3 , then the N-terminal DBCO-modified (dibenzocyclooctyne) antigen peptides were attached to these linkers. \n\nto the nanocarrier via a covalent bond, the construct with a reducible bond was more efficient than the construct with a nonreducible bond (Figure 3a) [93]. For disulfide bond formation, \"only\" an extra cysteine should be inserted at one terminus of the peptide. Hence, these OVA peptides were extended at their N-terminus with a Cys residue. This conjugation strategy was also used in the case of the gp100(25-33) peptide [94].",

            "text": "ADCs are composed of three integral components: a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets tumor antigens, a cytotoxic payload designed to disrupt DNA or tubulin within the targeted cancer cells, and a linker that covalently attaches the antibody to the payload. The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

The acceptance of mTG was lower toward PEG 4 -SMCC-DM1 (no cleavable linker), resulted in an average DAR of 1.25 upon the current reaction conditions (Table 1). These Immunoconjugates were used for the further experiments. \n\nThe conjugation of structurally different amine containing payloads required unique optimization. The Immunoconjugates were analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine the drug attachment in the antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1). The coupling of AlexaFluor488-cadaverine resulted in the maximum yield in the expected DAR of 2. For different tubulin inhibitor drugs, we obtained comparable conjugation efficacy. 75% of heavy chains were converted with PEG 4 -VC-PAB-MMAE (cleavable linker), the mixture of DAR1 and DAR2 was detected without the presence of any unconjugated antibodies (Table 1). \n\nTo evaluate the relative efficacy of conjugation, Qtag 2 was engineered in the C-terminal domains of the anti-Her2 antibody fragments (Fab, scfv and VHH) (Fig. 2B). The observed fluorescent signals at the HC and LC suggest that the investigated location does not affect the conjugation efficacy. In addition, the higher labeling level of the Fab with double Qtag indicates that these engineered Fabs are appropriate for the generation of DAR1 as well as DAR2. Using scfv (Fig. 2C) and VHH fragment (Fig. 2D), the same process was performed by addition of a sequence Q-Tag 2 at the C-terminus domain.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent one of the most rapidly expanding classes of anticancer drugs.Over the last few years, several ADCs have been approved as monotherapy for cancer treatment (Table 1 and 2) and many others are currently in clinical development [1].\n\nADCs consist of three main components: a monoclonal antibody (mAb), a linker, and a cytotoxic drug (also known as the payload) (Figure 1).The payload is connected to the mAb through the linker.Once the mAb component binds to its target antigen, the complex antigen-ADC is internalized in the tumor cell, and the payload is delivered and released at the tumor site.The linker is presently classified as cleavable and non-cleavable.Among cleavable linkers, there are varying degrees of stability: linkers less stable may trigger the bystander effect when cleaved, releasing the payload far from the targeted tumor cells and causing the destruction of neighboring cells.Non-cleavable linkers are stable in circulation and release the payload after internalization in response to lysosomal enzymes.Considering that the bystander effect is recognized as a significant component of ADC activity, optimizing linker stability is crucial for ADC effectiveness.The proportions of the three components circulating in the bloodstream differ based on the type of linker used and the overall integrity of the molecule [2].\n\nDespite the initial activity, tumor cells eventually develop resistance to ADCs limiting their use [3,4].Several mechanisms of resistance have been described, including changes at the antigen level (such as altered expression or mutations), changes in endocytosis mechanisms and vesicular trafficking, defects of lysosomal activity (pH, proteolytic enzymes), imbalance in proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors, alteration of signaling pathways, increased activity of the drug efflux pumps [3,4].",

            "text": "The methods reported for single-payload conjugation are limited but recent work has greatly advanced the area, which will bring major benefits to ADC programs by expanding the methods available. \n\nThe future of the field lies in utilising the methods to produce a variety of DAR 1 ADCs and antibody-protein/ antibody-antibody constructs that are not accessible by other means. For the generation of effective ADCs the combination of payload, antibody, and linker are crucial. Highly toxic payloads can benefit from incorporation into DAR 1 ADCs to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutics. Furthermore, by producing diverse payload-antibody combinations improved therapeutics can be accessed. \n\nAs Bruins et al. showed, conjugating an antibody with a single reactive handle allows for the creation of antibodyantibody constructs via a single linker. Further use of antibodies conjugated with a single reactive handle will allow diverse antibody-antibody combinations to be synthesised, opening up new highly targeted bispecific therapies leveraging the combined specificity of each antibody. In a similar manor, single payload attachment will allow for precise 1 : 1 antibody-protein constructs to be made which could be used to probe biological processes by utilising orthogonal binding of an antibody and protein. Alternatively, DAR 1 antibody-protein constructs could be beneficial if size and activity warranted use of a single protein. Furthermore, a controlled delivery of a protein to a specific cell could also be afforded with a cleavable linker, akin to classical ADCs. Whilst all the methods described above allowed access to single-payload species, many require complex antibody or process manipulation which limits DAR 1 ADC recovery and scale-up. Therefore, highly yielding conjugations which do not require chromatographic purifications or antibody manipulation are desired and should be further pursued. \n\nTo enable ADC properties to be effectively tuned, research into accessing other classically challenging DARs (such as 3) should be carried out via considered linker design and site selective conjugation. With robust methods developed, ADCs with precise DARs of 1-8 could be easily accessed, allowing for the drug loading to be tuned to balance the ADC's properties.",

            "text": "The concept of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapeutics combines the unique targeting properties of a monoclonal antibody to deliver a high potency of a cytotoxin attached via an appropriate linker. As the number of ADCs entering the clinic and achieving regulatory approval continues to grow, there remains a concerted research effort to explore alternative drug-linker designs with the aim of enhancing ADC efficacy and safety. A wide array of structural options for the linker component connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic drug exist. Recent attention has focused on the use of site-specific conjugating linkers to improve ADC homogeneity and a variety of both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been employed to maximize toxin delivery to tumor cells (Frigerio and Kyle, 2017;Zhou, 2017;Dal Corso et al., 2019). \n\nRecent research has focused on the inclusion of polymeric portions within ADC linker structure to overcome some of the inherent issues surrounding ADC design such as hydrophobicity, aggregation, instability, insufficient drug-loading and reduced circulatory half-life. Typically, the polymers have been amphiphilic in nature, being water-soluble, synthetic and substantially non-antigenic with particular focus on polyalkylene oxides such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Since the first PEGylated protein was approved in 1990, PEG has become one of the most widely used polymers in biopharmaceutical applications with numerous products entering clinical trials and receiving marketing approval (Veronese and Mero, 2008;Turecek et al., 2016). PEG features within two of the currently approved ADCs, sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy \u00ae ) and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta \u00ae ), and its utility within ADC reagents has been widely investigated, mainly to improve reagent solubility and to reduce aggregation of the final ADC.",

            "text": "A vital component of an ADC is the linker that constitutes the connection between payload and antibody. Choosing the preferred crosslinker is crucial not only to provide stability for the ADC but also to assure optimal release of the payload at the desired location [33]. Both the type of crosslinker and the location of conjugation can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and clinical tolerance of the ADC. The mechanism for drug release is also dependent on the type of linker, be it cleavable or non-cleavable (Figure 4). Examples of cleavable crosslinkers include: acid-sensitive linkers, glutathione-sensitive linkers, lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers [46]. \n\nA non-cleavable crosslinker is said to offer greater plasma stability because of its nonreducible amino acid linker and thioether bond, which reduces non-specific drug release compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [47]. With a non-cleavable ADC, the drug is dissociated from the antibody after internalization and lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody [33,48]. The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acidcleavable hydrazone linker, which makes use of the lower pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The linker is stable in blood at neutral pH; once the ADC is internalized into acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4-6), the linker is cleaved. The release of the drug after 24 h at 37 \u2022 C is 97% at pH = 4.5, whereas only 6% was freed at pH = 7.4 [49]. The pHsensitive linkers include hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and the CL2A linker. Disulfide linkers are cleavable by both pH and glutathione [50].",

            "text": "Background/Objectives: Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents is a well-established approach to cancer therapy. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) typically carry toxic payloads attached to a tumor-associated antigen-targeting IgG antibody via an enzyme-cleavable linker that releases the drug inside the cell. Aptamers are a promising alternative to antibodies in terms of antigen targeting; however, their polynucleotide nature and smaller size result in a completely different PK/PD profile compared to an IgG. This may prove advantageous: owing to their lower molecular weight, aptamer-drug conjugates may achieve better penetration of solid tumors compared to ADCs. Methods: On the way to therapeutic aptamer\u2013drug conjugates, we aimed to develop a versatile and modular approach for the assembly of aptamer\u2013enzymatically cleavable payload conjugates of various drug\u2013aptamer ratios. We chose the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane protein often overexpressed in brain tumors, as the target antigen. We used the 46 mer EGFR-targeting DNA sequence GR-20, monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) on the cathepsin-cleavable ValCit-p-aminobenzylcarbamate linker as the payload, and pentaerythritol-based tetraazide as the branching point for the straightforward synthesis of aptamer\u2013drug conjugates by means of a stepwise Cu-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reaction. Results: Branched aptamer conjugates of 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1 stoichiometry were synthesized and showed higher cytotoxic activity compared to a 1:1 conjugate, particularly on several glioma cell lines. Conclusions: This approach is convenient and potentially applicable to any aptamer sequence, as well as other payloads and cleavable linkers, thus paving the way for future development of aptamer\u2013drug therapeutics by easily providing a range of branched conjugates for in vitro and in vivo testing.",

Unlike their cleavable counterparts, non-cleavable linkers do not induce a bystander effect on neighboring cells in the bloodstream where peptidases are absent. Additionally, they offer enhanced plasma safety and greater resistance to proteolysis compared to cleavable linkers. Recent advancements have given rise to non-cleavable linkers, notably the SMCC (Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) linkers and MD (Molecular Dynamics) linkers, which are currently in development. The hydrophilic nature of linker plays a pivotal role in diminishing nonspecific uptake or off-target toxicity of payload. SMCC linkers incorporate a cyclo-nucleic acid ring that reduces the antibody conjugate's hydrolysis rate at high pH levels, thus bolstering stability while preserving antibody specificity. On the other hand, MD linkers substitute the cyclo-nucleic acid ring of SMCC linkers with 1,3-dioxolein, enhancing linker hydrophilicity and stability due to the presence of two oxygen atoms within the 1,3-dioxolein ring (Figure 4). Notably, the current ADCs technologies making use of this approach include Kadcycla \u00ae (Basel, Switzerland) [44][45][46].",

            "text": "Despite its relatively small size compared to the rest of the theranostic agent, the linker is crucial in determining the bioactivity profile of the final kinase inhibitor-fluorophore conjugate. The linker must be carefully selected to optimize the pharmacokinetics and augment the delivery capacity of the kinase inhibitor to the target site while preventing a premature release. Additionally, the linker should not interfere with the binding affinity and selectivity of the kinase inhibitor towards its protein target. An inappropriate linker choice can lead to reduced efficacy or complete abolishment of the binding. \n\nAdditionally, the linker should be chemically/enzymatically resilient within the blood circulation to allow the conjugate to reach its kinase target intact and afford a spatiotemporal drug release within the tumor site. An example is discussed in the succeeding section whereby the conjugate C8a can selectively release the drug in the tumor site via a glutathione-mediated disulfide bond cleavage, increasing the efficacy of the utilized parent anticancer drug. The linker also plays a key role in keeping the dye out of the primary kinase domain site, which otherwise may interfere and result in diminished potency of the drug [47]. \n\nThe most common linkers used in kinase inhibitor-fluorophore conjugates include amides and esters. These linkers are specifically designed to be cleaved in the cancer microenvironment, where high levels of amidases and esterases are present [48]. Additionally, ethylene glycol linkers are frequently employed among classic linkers to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitor. Another class of linkers that is continuously gaining attention involves linkers that are rationally designed to become cleaved under specific stimuli overexpressed in the tumor environment. For instance, certain bonds can be hydrolyzed selectively in the presence of the slightly acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment to release the active drug, while they are stable in the blood circulation [49]. These include imine, oxime, hydrazone, orthoester, acetal, and vinyl ether.",

            "text": "Dear Editor, Antibody\u2012drug conjugates (ADCs), famous as biological targeting prodrugs, are gradually revolutionizing clinical cancer therapy. However, less than 1% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in the tumors. Therefore, the nonspecific release of the highly toxic payload (MMAE et al., 10\u201310 M) is a real threat, which could induce severe off-target toxicity. This danger necessitates strict requirements for the design of the linker. To date, the mainstream enzyme cleavable linkers, including \u03b2-glucuronidase cleavable linkers, sulfatase-cleavable linkers, and the most popular cathepsin cleavable linkers (valine-citrulline linker), all face this nonspecific release problem, because their cleaving enzymes are widely distributed with no significant difference in their quantities between tumor tissues and normal tissues. Hypoxia, as the most important feature of the solid tumor microenvironment, has always been a target of drug discovery programs. Hypoxia can lead to the upregulation of nitroreductase (NTR), which has been detected at levels 100\u20131000-fold higher than that in normoxic cells. The most important function of NTR is to reduce the nitro group to an amino group under hypoxia rather than normoxia. In this work, a novel ADC design strategy was proposed. Based on the traditional antibody targeting the \u201cprodrug\u201d, we further utilized hypoxia-specific drug release to design an ADC as a \u201cproprodrug\u201d, achieving a superior therapeutic index (Fig. 1a). More specifically, in tumor tissues (O2% < 1%), the novel nitroaromaticcontaining linker was activated by the NTR to smoothly release the active drug. Notably, the beauty of this strategy is that in normal tissues (O2% > 10%), the pro-prodrug was metabolized and stably remained in the low toxicity and low permeability prodrug form (Cys-linker-payload), which was crucial to reduce off-target toxicity.

            "text": "First, we designed and developed a novel thioether linker (IDconnect) to produce a sitespecific ADC. IDconnect was based on a novel maleimide scaffold with a 4-mercapto-benzoyl-morpholine leaving group in the 3-and 4-positions; this group was designed to improve water solubility and decrease nucleophilicity of the conventional thiophenol group (Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 34). This linker-payload complex would facilitate sitespecific conjugation without introduction of cysteine mutations or nonnatural amino acids. Biochemical characterization showed that 9MW2821 maintained high purity and a homogenous DAR of 4. This special conjugation also preserved the original properties of the parental antibody, such as binding affinity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and affinity to Fcg and FcRn. Conventional stochastic conjugation methods generate EV that contains a mixture of molecules with varying DAR and sites of conjugation (Supplementary Fig. S3; refs. 44,45). The heterogeneous mixtures can have significant differences in binding affinity, stability, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles, which leads to variability in toxicity and efficacy in patients (46,47). A site-specific and highly homogenous ADC with a DAR of 4 can properly balance drug delivery and pharmacokinetic stability. In addition, the 3,5-difluorophenyl moiety in our design accelerated the complete hydrolysis of the maleimide, which prevented deconjugation by the retro-Michael reaction, thereby stabilizing the antibody conjugate (34,48,49). Although N-aryl maleimide is commonly used to accelerate in situ maleimide hydrolysis to make an ADC stable at physiological pH, this linkage-complex can be cleaved quantitatively in a mildly acidic environment. By introducing the 3,5-difluorophenyl group, we avoided this undesirable drug release and further enhanced ADC stability (28,49).",

ITC-6102RO is a B7-H3-targeting ADC and comprises an anti-B7-H3 antibody and a benzodiazepine dimer derivative, which is a DNA cross-linking agent, connected by a maleimide-containing OHPAS linker. The linker-payload and antibody-drug conjugate was prepared at IntoCell. Thiomab site-specific conjugation technology was used for ITC-6102RO. Prior to conjugating the B7-H3 thiomab to dHBD via the maleimide-containing OHPAS linker, any blocking cysteine or glutathione present on the thiomab was eliminated by mild reduction in PBS at 37 \u00b0C through the addition of a 5000-fold molar excess of reducing agent L-cysteine, followed by diafiltration. To re-establish the inter-chain disulfide bond, the reduced thiomab was incubated for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. A 4.5-fold molar excess of maleimide-linker drug was then incubated with the activated thiomab for one hour at 40 \u00b0C, followed by diafiltration. Hydrolysis of the succinimide ring in the linker drug occurred under 50 mM borate buffer (pH 9.2) for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. The antibody conjugate was subsequently purified using preparative HIC column Fig. 1 Characteristics of ITC-6102RO. (A) Composition of the ADC. (B) Binding affinity between antibody and ADC. BLI kinetic assays were performed using an Octet QKE biosensor by first capturing 10-\u00b5g/ml antibodies with anti-human Fc (AHC) biosensors, followed by a 300 s baseline step in kinetic buffer. Binding sensorgrams were obtained using the 8-channel detection mode on the Octet QKE unit chromatography, and the number of conjugated linker drugs per antibody was quantified through HIC-HPLC analysis.",

            "text": "We expect this trend to continue, as carbonyl-based conjugations, particularly hydrazone formation and especially oxime ligation, represent an important tool in the toolbox of biorthogonal reactions. Rivaling the extremely well-developed azide-alkyne cycloadditions in terms of selectivity and reaction rate, oxime ligation is continuously being used to generate antibody conjugates, in particular, ADCs. \n\nIn a global sense, antibody-drug conjugate technologies are currently focused on obtaining conjugates that are as site-specific and homogeneous as possible. Equally important is the stability of the conjugate in the bloodstream, which includes the reliability of conjugation of the linker with the cytotoxic agent to the antibody as well as the stability of the linker in the plasma. The homogeneity and site-specificity of the ADC, as well as its stability in plasma, significantly improve its pharmacodynamic properties, efficacy, and reduce the severity of side effects. \n\nIt appears that the most effective approach involves incorporating a bioorthogonal functional group into antibodies through the use of natural and genetically engineered amino acids. This approach is well established for antibody conjugates produced by the THIOMAB technology, which consists of introducing an additional unpaired cysteine into the antibody that is suitable for further modification, including the generation of a carbonyl group by FGE. One of the conjugates produced using this technology, Polivy, has already been approved by the FDA for use in patients. Several others, including an antibacterial conjugate, are in clinical trials. \n\nThe introduction of unnatural amino acids with a carbonyl group, such as paraacetylphenylalanine, is also a promising approach. However, unlike the introduction of natural amino acids into the antibody sequence, the introduction of unnatural amino acids with biorthogonal functional groups is a very labor-intensive task: it requires obtaining a mutant tRNA/RS pair, which is not trivial in itself, and overcoming difficulties with antibody production in cell culture. This makes the process expensive and makes it difficult to apply the method to the production of conjugates on an industrial scale.",

            "title": "IgG Fc Affinity Ligands and Their Applications in Antibody-Involved Drug Delivery: A Brief Review",
            "text": "Over the past ten years, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have made considerable progress in the field of cancer therapy. ADCs utilize the high binding specificity and affinity of antibodies to target antigens and specifically direct potent cytotoxic payloads into cancer cells [62]. The structure of an ADC contains four components: the monoclonal antibody, cytotoxic payload, linker, and conjugation site [63]. The linker used in the construction of ADCs is responsible for the formation of stable conjugates in the systemic circulation and the release of the payload after the ADC internalization at the target site [64]. Currently, there are three methods commonly used to bind linkers to antibodies, namely through chemical coupling strategy, using enzyme catalysis [63], and using antibodies with added cysteine residues or designed to be doped with unnatural amino acids [65]. Structural modifications to antibodies may lead to changes in antibody activity, such as the targeting ability, and also pose a challenge for scaled-up antibody production. \n\nTherefore, an alternative approach to the production of homogeneous ADCs using unmodified antibody scaffolds would be advantageous [66]. As discussed in the previous sections, there are many moieties with high Fc affinity. It is simpler and easier to conjugate drugs to these moieties to form Fc-binding moieties-drug conjugates than to chemically conjugate payloads to antibodies. The drug payloads could be non-covalently conjugated into antibodies by means of the high binding affinity between the Fc affinity ligand and Fc region of the antibody. A significant advantage of this approach is that it can quickly conjugate drugs to site-specific Fc regions to obtain homogeneous non-covalent conjugates. Given the relatively conserved sequence of IgG Fc regions, it is a potentially scalable or broad-spectrum strategy [66]. \n\nAs shown in Table 3, several studies have used different affinity ligands to generate non-covalent ADCs. Gupta et al. [6] have developed multivalent and affinity-guided antibody empowerment technology (MAGNET) to engineer the non-covalent ADC.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), famous as biological targeting prodrugs, are gradually revolutionizing clinical cancer therapy. However, less than 1% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in the tumors. 1 Therefore, the nonspecific release of the highly toxic payload (MMAE et al., 10 \u221212 -10 \u221210 M) is a real threat, which could induce severe off-target toxicity. 2 This danger necessitates strict requirements for the design of the linker. To date, the mainstream enzyme cleavable linkers, including \u03b2-glucuronidase cleavable linkers, sulfatase-cleavable linkers, and the most popular cathepsin cleavable linkers (valine-citrulline linker), all face this nonspecific release problem, 3 because their cleaving enzymes are widely distributed with no significant difference in their quantities between tumor tissues and normal tissues. \n\nHypoxia, as the most important feature of the solid tumor microenvironment, has always been a target of drug discovery programs. 4 Hypoxia can lead to the upregulation of nitroreductase (NTR), which has been detected at levels 100-1000-fold higher than that in normoxic cells. 5 The most important function of NTR is to reduce the nitro group to an amino group under hypoxia rather than normoxia. 4 n this work, a novel ADC design strategy was proposed. Based on the traditional antibody targeting the \"prodrug\", we further utilized hypoxia-specific drug release to design an ADC as a \"proprodrug\", achieving a superior therapeutic index (Fig. 1a). More specifically, in tumor tissues (O 2 % < 1%), the novel nitroaromaticcontaining linker was activated by the NTR to smoothly release the active drug. Notably, the beauty of this strategy is that in normal tissues (O 2 % > 10%), the pro-prodrug was metabolized and stably remained in the low toxicity and low permeability prodrug form (Cys-linker-payload), which was crucial to reduce off-target toxicity.",

The water-soluble short polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers were employed to optimize the in vivo kinetics of the conjugate as necessary [30]. Urea-based Lys-Urea-Glu [31], which is a commonly used targeting moiety for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), serves as a model vector for cancer-targeted delivery of TLR7 agonists. Of note, the well-observed PSMA-mediated internalization mechanism upon ligand-binding [32] is leveraged for the intracellular delivery of the TLR7 payload carried by the T-SMPDCs. To enable the designed controlled release [33][34][35], we incorporate a legumain-cleavable linker, Azido-PEG 4 -Ala-Ala-Asn(Trt)-PAB-PNP (Azido-PEG 4 -LEGU), which is stable in the blood, as reported in many antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), to minimize the off-target toxicities [36,37], but undergoes a traceless release (self-immolation) of drugs upon interacting with legumain, a lysosomal endopeptidase. For the proof-of-concept, in this work we chose gardiquimod (GARD) as a model TLR7 agonist to construct our prodrug conjugates, which was coupled to the legumain-cleavable linker.",

            "text": "The chemical linker that connects the antibody to the cytotoxic payload plays a crucial role in ADC design. Various factors, such as the chemistry of the linker, the conjugation strategy, and the site of conjugation, critically influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the ADC. Several approaches can be used for coupling the linker to the antibody, including site-directed linkage to specific amino acids-which is the most commonly used in clinical practice and approved ADCs-and random conjugation to lysine or cysteine residues. Lysine linkage is based on the coupling of an amine from the mAb and an activated carboxylic acid of the payload, while the cysteine-based coupling of mAb reacts cysteine residues with a thiol-reactive functional group in the payload. These two methods generate random conjugates with different DAR and low homogeneity, since the payloads can couple on numerous residues along the mAb. However, other approaches exist to incorporate non-natural amino acids through genetic engineering into the antibody peptidic sequence with specific residual groups that favor site-directed conjugation [32,33]. The coupling of the payload to the mAb can also be generated by enzymatic strategies leading to tightly controlled DARs, as they show high site-specificity. The main enzymemediated strategies are transpeptidation using sortase A, microbial transglutaminase or N-Glycan engineering [34][35][36]. Protein conjugates, particularly in the production of bispecific antibodies, represent a rapidly advancing field of interest, with evolving technologies poised to advance conjugation techniques. This advancement enables the creation of sitespecific ADCs without necessitating extensive antibody engineering. Recent applications have demonstrated the successful generation of potent bispecific antibodies, underscoring the versatility of chemical methods and their potential in advancing targeted therapeutic development. Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the field of anticancer therapeutics has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with a particular focus on the development of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) as a promising approach. These ADCs consist of a three-component structure: an antibody that selectively binds to a target antigen, a highly potent drug (payload) that induces targeted cell death, and a linker that connects the antibody to the drug. This combination offers several advantages, including high target specificity, prolonged half-life in the body, and reduced side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. \n\nThe evolution of ADCs can be categorized into three generations, each addressing specific limitations and challenges. First-generation ADCs faced issues related to drug binding sites on antibodies, efficiency, and side effects. Second-generation ADCs employed advanced techniques, such as controlling the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and selective conjugation of drugs to specific antibody sites, to enhance their efficacy and safety. The latest third-generation ADCs aim for uniform drug binding to antibodies without compromising antigen-antibody binding. \n\nThe growth of ADCs aligns with the rising prominence of biopharmaceuticals in the pharmaceutical market, with anticancer drugs projected to dominate global drug consumption. In particular, the ADC market is expected to expand significantly, reaching multi-billion-dollar figures. The recent surge in ADCs candidates and approvals reflects the growing interest and investment in this therapeutic approach. \n\nResearch efforts have predominantly focused on targeting antigens like HER2 and EGFR, showing promise in various cancers. Clinical studies have further demonstrated the potential of ADCs, with a substantial number of trials in progress, particularly for HER2-targeted ADCs. The choice of linkers and payloads in ADCs design plays a critical role in their stability and efficacy, with Val-Cit linkers and microtubule polymerization inhibitors being common choices. \n\nIn summary, Antibody-Drug Conjugates represent a rapidly evolving and promising avenue in the field of anticancer therapeutics. As research continues to uncover novel targets, linkers, and drug payloads, the potential for ADCs to revolutionize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes remains high. The future of anticancer therapeutics is undeniably intertwined with the continued growth and innovation of ADCs.",

            "text": "Targeted drug delivery approaches that selectively and preferentially deliver therapeutic agents to specific tissues are of great interest for safer and more effective pharmaceutical treatments. We investigated whether cathepsin B cleavage of a valine\u2013citrulline [VC(S)]-containing linker is required for the release of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) from albumin\u2013drug conjugates. In this study, we used an engineered version of human serum albumin, Veltis High Binder II (HBII), which has enhanced binding to the neonatal Fc (fragment crystallizable) receptor (FcRn) to improve drug release upon binding and FcRn-mediated recycling. The linker\u2013payload was conjugated to cysteine 34 of albumin using a carbonylacrylic (caa) reagent which produced homogeneous and plasma stable conjugates that retained FcRn binding. Two caa\u2013linker\u2013MMAE reagents were synthesized\u2014one with a cleavable [VC(S)] linker and one with a noncleavable [VC(R)] linker\u2014to question whether protease-mediated cleavage is needed for MMAE release. Our findings demonstrate that cathepsin B is required to achieve efficient and selective antitumor activity. The conjugates equipped with the cleavable [VC(S)] linker had potent antitumor activity in vivo facilitated by the release of free MMAE upon FcRn binding and internalization. In addition to the pronounced antitumor activity of the albumin conjugates in vivo, we also demonstrated their preferable tumor biodistribution and biocompatibility with no associated toxicity or side effects. These results suggest that the use of engineered albumins with high FcRn binding combined with protease cleavable linkers is an efficient strategy to target delivery of drugs to solid tumors.",

            "text": "We conducted mouse PK studies with AOCs comprised of an \u03b1hEGFR antibody conjugated to siEGFR-PEG5k (PEG5k conjugated to the 3\u2032 end of siEGFR by a stable thioether). We included a stable MCC linker between the mAb and siRNA (\u03b1hEGFR-Cys-MCC-siEGFR-PEG5k) and compared it with an enzyme-cleavable VC linker (\u03b1hEGFR-Cys-VC-siEGFR-PEG5k). Further iterations of these AOCs were synthesized to evaluate the impact of a cleavable SS linker between the siRNA and PEG5k (\u03b1hEGFR-Cys-siEGFR-SS-PEG5k and \u03b1hEGFR-VC-siEGFR-SS-PEG5k). We measured the plasma PK of these AOCs over time (Figure 6a,b) and observed no significant differences in clearance of the siRNA. However, our stem-loop assay for the detection of the antisense strand is insensitive to the presence of a PEG group attached to the sense strand, meaning the stability of the PEG5k group attached via a disulfide bond remains unclear. Furthermore, it is possible that a large PEG at the end of the siRNA could influence linker stability, for instance by limiting enzyme accessibility to the VC linker. However, considering the radius of gyration for PEG5k (\u223c3 nm) and the length of a 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex (\u223c7.5 nm), it is unlikely that PEG attached to the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand would have a significant impact on the stability of the linker at the 5\u2032 end. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the impact of these modifications on the PK of AOCs. \n\nFurther mouse PK studies were conducted with AOCs comprised of \u03b1hEGFR mAb conjugated to siKRAS via different cleavable disulfide linkers (PDP, MPT, SS[methyl], and SS[gem-dimethyl]) between the mAb and siRNA. 40",

            "text": "The linker is a very essential part of protein conjugation, especially for ADCs. Linker chemistry can be tuned to impart adequate stability for protein drugs [150]. As mentioned above, PEGylation is an example of using hydrophilic PEG linkers to improve drug efficacy [151]. There are many factors to consider when choosing linkers for ADCs. Nevertheless, one of the most important of them is the stability of the linker throughout its presence in the plasma, while it must break down as soon as it enters the target cell (in the form of a conjugate with ADCs) and leads to the activation of the released anti-cancer drugs [152]. There are cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. The cleavable linkers are cleaved by chemical or biochemical changes in the environment such as acidic changes for hydrozone linkers and glutathione or high pH values for disulfide linkers. Some other cleavable linkers contain enzymatic digestion sites and are sensitive to the enzymes inside the vesicle such as valine-citrulline di-peptides for cathepsin B enzyme. On the other hand, the non-cleavable linkers depend on the complete digestion of the antibody after entering the vesicle [153]. \n\nAmong the important reasons that led to the removal of Mylotarg from the marketing list in 2010 were items such as the instability of the hydrazine linker and its payload release [154,155]. More recently, Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) 1 with a non-cleavable linker is the first generation of ADCs approved for the treatment of HER2 (human epider-mal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer. Second-generation ADCs targeting HER2, trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985), was characterized to supersede T-DM1 by overcoming all resistance using a cleavable linker and a more potent payload, duocarmycin (DUBA) via different conjugation chemistry.",

It maintains the stability of the drug conjugate in the bloodstream while effectively releasing the payload inside the target cell [27]. Linkers are categorized into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable [27]. Cleavable linkers can be broken down by reactions involving proteases, acidic pH, endosomes, or lysosomes. This allows some of the cytotoxic payload to be released into the tumor microenvironment, impacting both antigen-expressing target cells and nearby non-antigen-expressing cells through the bystander effect [28]. Conversely, non-cleavable linkers rely on the lysosomal proteolytic activity of the antibody to release the payload. When non-cleavable linkers are cleaved, the payload remains attached to the linker, which can affect its electrical charge, hydrophobicity, or hydrophilicity. This may influence the payload's ability to cross the cell membrane. Moreover, the linker itself can be expelled from the cell by efflux pumps, leading to the removal of the linker-payload complex. This can decrease the intracellular concentration of the payload and potentially contribute to drug resistance [27].",

            "text": "Improved linker chemistry is crucial in the design of polymer-drug conjugates as it determines the stability and drug release kinetics of the conjugate [69]. Linkers act as a bridge between the drug and the polymer backbone, and advancements in this area have led to the creation of linkers that are stable in circulation but can be cleaved under specific conditions present in the diseased tissues. Cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature drug release. Once they reach the target site, such as a tumor, they can be cleaved through various mechanisms. For instance, linkers can be pH-sensitive, cleaving in the acidic environment of tumors or inflamed tissue. Alternatively, they can be enzyme-sensitive, breaking down in the presence of certain enzymes overexpressed in disease states [70,71]. \n\nSelf-Immolative linker undergoes a cascade of chemical reactions triggered by a stimulus (like an enzyme or pH change), resulting in the complete breakdown of the linker and release of the drug [72]. This design allows for a more precise and complete release of the therapeutic agent. Hydrolysable linkers undergo hydrolysis in the body, a process that can be tuned to happen more quickly or more slowly depending on the chemical composition of the linker. By choosing the right hydrolyzable bond (e.g., ester, amide), researchers can control the drug release rate appropriate for the therapy. Some linkers are designed to serve multiple purposes, such as including a diagnostic moiety for imaging or providing a specific binding site for targeting. These linkers add functionality and enable the synthesis of theranostic agents [73]. \n\nDr. Davis and his team designed a polymer-drug conjugate using a biocompatible block copolymer, PEG-PGA, with the anticancer drug camptothecin conjugated via a disulfide linker [74]. The disulfide bond was chosen for its ability to be cleaved in the reductive environment of the tumor cells, which typically exhibit higher levels of glutathione compared to normal cells.",

            "text": "The identification of peptides or small-molecule payloads toward a particular target or disease is a logical starting point for the design of PDCs. Effective delivery of payloads to the target site is a challenging task. The peptide part of PDCs mainly drives target specificity, enabling site-specific payload delivery while reducing their toxicity. Over the past decade, innovations in PDC peptides (Figure 3), such as novel CTPs, CPPs, self-assembling peptides (SAPs), and stimuli-responsive peptides (SRPs), have tremendously improved the therapeutic efficacy of payloads. Most peptide drugs are hormone mimics or derived from natural products. 12 The design of potent and selective peptides that target receptor ligand-binding domains remains challenging. Various encoding and display technologies are used to identify high-potency peptide sequences for target proteins. 13 ucleotide-encoded mass library screening techniques 14 advance non-natural moieties or nonproteinogenic amino acids to address challenging inaccessible drug targets, including phage display screening, split-intein circular ligation of peptides and proteins, mRNA display, and the one-bead-one-compound or split-and-pool strategies. Peptides screened through these methods usually have high affinity for target proteins. \n\nThe linker plays an important role in PDC design, as it strongly impacts the safety and potency of the PDC. Two main categories of linkers have been developed based on their cleavability (Figure 4). Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH, glutathione, or proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide linkers. Noncleavable linkers, such as thiazole, oxime, or thioether, enhance PDC circulatory stability in humans. \n\nThe final conjugation step is crucial in PDC synthesis. Amide or ester formation has proven useful and efficient for linking peptides to payloads or linkers. Recently, click reactions have gained prominence owing to their high efficiency, rapidity, and mild reaction conditions (Figure 5). 15 Among these, azide\u2212alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition is widely used, forming triazole units in both aqueous and organic solvents. 16",

A novel ISAC was designed, featuring the IMD Resiquimod (R848), a tumor-targeting antibody specific for Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) and the protease-cleavable Val-Cit-PABC linker. In vitro stability analysis showed not only R848 release in the presence of the protease Cathepsin B but also under acidic conditions. The ex vivo mass spectrometry-based biodistribution data confirmed the low stability of the linker-drug connection while highlighting the selective accumulation of the IgG in tumors and its long circulatory half-life.",

Valpreda et al. compared the direct coupling to a single MVK and two double MVK (MV-amBn-MVK and MVK(Me)2-amBn-MVK) motifs. The single MVK compound showed a decrease of 43%, resulting in a 53 %IA/g uptake in the kidneys at 24 h in comparison to the reference compound without a cleavable linker. A significantly better reduction with the dual cleavable linker of 63% and 54% could be achieved. But, a significant reduction of tumor uptake for the dual MVK linkers was also observed. However, the tumor-to-kidney ratios at 24 h p.i. were improved for all MVK-based FnBPA5.1 conjugates, with MV-amBn-MVK displaying an almost 2-fold increase compared to the compound without a cleavable linker [123]. Although this is a promising result, it is still not good enough for therapeutic application. \n\nArano et al. have written a detailed review about renal cleavable linkers [124]. In summary, cleavable linkers are a highly interesting approach to significantly reduce kidney uptake. However, further optimization is still necessary, and the mechanism of in vivo cleavage and how metabolites are processed has not been fully understood. Additionally, there is no proof of concept (yet) that this approach provides benefits for therapeutic application, where kidney uptake is often a main problem for small proteins and peptides.",

            "text": "Arming monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with small-molecule drugs enables targeted delivery of a biologically active payload to specific cells expressing target antigen. Antibody\u2212drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a powerful therapeutic modality to specifically eradicate target tumor cells by directing the highly potent cytotoxic drugs to the cells that express specific antigens on their surface. Furthermore, the ADC field is growing beyond oncology therapeutics. For instance, antibody\u2212antibiotic conjugates, which consist of an anti-microbial antibody and a highly efficacious antibiotic, have been developed to treat bacterial infections. 1 ADCs have also been utilized to deliver antigens, adjuvants, or innate agonists to the tumor microenvironment or to antigen-presenting cells to boost immune response specific to malignancies. 2,3 To date, a total of twelve ADCs have been approved by the FDA and the indications include various hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. Although ADCs have great potential to make a paradigm shift in targeted therapy, designing an ideal ADC is complex, as attaching a hydrophobic payload can lead to structural destabilization and enhanced propensity to aggregate. 4 Generally, coupling the drug to the antibody results in a decrease in melting point, and the negative impact on thermal stability is intensified with increased drug loading and hydrophobicity of payload. 5 In addition to thermodynamic properties, metabolic and chemical stability of the payload and specific cleavability of the linker also need to be considered. The payload should be stable during storage and circulation in the blood and also efficient release of free payload is required at targeted sites. The stability of payload is highly dependent on the conjugation site that has diverse electrostatic and/or steric environments. In this work, we evaluated thermodynamic properties and plasma stability of site-specific ADCs bearing the linker-payload in close proximity to the CH2 C'E loop Asn297 undergoing N-glycosylation, which plays a critical role in thermal stability of antibody therapeutics. \n\nTo our surprise, an improvement in the melting temperature was observed by introducing a tubulysin payload to aglycosylated antibodies.",

            "text": "Hence, achieving reasonable chemical stability is instrumental when designing the linkage between the antibody and the effector component. In congruity with the previous reports (Woitok et al. 2017(Woitok et al. , 2016)), we showcase the application of SNAP-tag technology as a method to achieve stable and efficient linkage of the small molecule toxin AURIF to scFvs targeting CSPG4 surface antigen. Since the in vitro cytotoxic effects of ADCs correlate with the number of effector molecules on the antibody (Pillow et al. 2014), multiple AURIF derivatives could be attached to one BG molecule and conjugated to SNAP-tag to potentially improve the efficacy of the recombinant ADCs, without affecting their antigen-binding ability or their homogeneity (Woitok et al. 2017(Woitok et al. , 2016)). Alternatively, the introduction of a cleavable linker in-between the scFv and SNAP-tag (such as the cathepsin B cleavable citrulline-valine linker in brentuximab vedotin) could also enhance cytotoxicity by assisting in the intracellular release of the toxic payload (Woitok et al. 2016). This PEG-linker addition is commonly used as a stabilizer to reduce scFv clearance rate from bloodstream, thus increasing their half-life and potency (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al. 2022). In this regards, 425(scFv)-SNAP-tag conjugated with near-infrared dye (BG-747) was reported to specifically accumulate in the tumor 10 h post-injection, with a rapid complete bloodstream clearance observed 72 h post-injection (Kampmeier et al. 2010). \n\nTo further reduce the potential adverse events associated with our AURIF conjugate, \u03b1CSPG4(scFv)-SNAP-tag based photoimmunotherapy (PIT) could be prioritized for nonmetastatic triple-negative breast tumors on the basis of PIT requiring an extra step of light activation to exert its phototoxic effects (Amoury et al. 2016a;Hsu et al. 2022).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of targeted therapeutics used to selectively kill cancer cells. It is important that they remain intact in the bloodstream and release their payload in the target cancer cell for maximum efficacy and minimum toxicity. The development of effective ADCs requires the study of factors that can alter the stability of these therapeutics at the atomic level. Here, we present a general strategy that combines synthesis, bioconjugation, linker technology, site-directed mutagenesis, and modeling to investigate the influence of the site and microenvironment of the trastuzumab antibody on the stability of the conjugation and linkers. Trastuzumab is widely used to produce targeted ADCs because it can target with high specificity a receptor that is overexpressed in certain breast cancer cells (HER2). We show that the chemical environment of the conjugation site of trastuzumab plays a key role in the stability of linkers featuring acid-sensitive groups such as acetals. More specifically, Lys-207, located near the reactive Cys-205 of a thiomab variant of the antibody, may act as an acid catalyst and promote the hydrolysis of acetals. Mutation of Lys-207 into an alanine or using a longer linker that separates this residue from the acetal group stabilizes the conjugates. Analogously, Lys-207 promotes the beneficial hydrolysis of the succinimide ring when maleimide reagents are used for conjugation, thus stabilizing the subsequent ADCs by impairing the undesired retro-Michael reactions. This work provides new insights for the design of novel ADCs with improved stability properties.",

            "text": "Disulfide chemistry is among the most investigated linker technologies in drug delivery. The one limitation commonly encountered in these endeavors is that a disulfide is a bond between two sulfur atoms, and only few marketed drugs feature thiols in their structure. A successful route to overcome this limitation and apply disulfide chemistry to a wide range of drugs is the use of \"self-immolative linkers.\" [28] These linkers are designed to undergo fast decomposition upon a scission of the disulfide bond, most commonly via intramolecular cyclization, to afford a traceless release of the drug from its conjugate in its pristine form ( Figure 1B). Mercaptoethanol dimer (compound 1a, Figure 1C) is a convenient, readily available starting material for these syntheses. In our work, 1a was converted into a sym-metrical homobifunctional amine-reactive carbonate, and subsequently reacted with mitomycin C to afford a drug-linker conjugate (1) for a single-step conjugation to an antibody. Literature survey reveals that stability of disulfides against decomposition in blood significantly improves when carbon atom(s) adjacent to sulfurs are substituted with, for example, methyl groups, which create steric shields to non-specific exchange between this disulfide and cysteine thiols on albumin and other serum proteins. Learning from this, linker 2 was designed, starting with 3-methyl-3-sulfanylbutan-1-ol (compound 2a, Figure 1D) which was oxidized using CuCl 2 into the sterically hindered disulfide (2b). This was reacted with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate to afford the homobifunctional carbonate 2b and then with mitomycin C to obtain the final drug-linker conjugate 2.\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 are amine-reactive and were used to conjugate to the antibodies in their aqueous solutions ( Figure 1E). ADCs were purified via gel filtration and characterized for composition using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI), which revealed that protein conjugates had molar mass higher than",

Mechanistically, non-cleavable linkers are unable to degrade by proteolysis and do not influence the activity of the payload after conjugation [92]. Currently, several non-cleavable alkyl and polymeric linkers are being explored in ADC development. In particular, the most representative linker is the succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) crosslinker, which is a heterobifunctional protein crosslinker with a sulfhydrylreactive maleimide group and an amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester group [101,102] (Figure 2). It is applied in trastuzumab emtansine for the conjugation of an-HER-2 antibodies and DM1, which has been approved for the treatment of HER-2positive breast cancer [103]. In addition, CD37-antigen-targeted naratuximab emtansine, which consists of anti-CD37 mAbs and cytotoxin DM1 through an SMCC linker, is beginning to be investigated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma treatment in clinical trials [104,105]. \n\ntive R/R DLBCL, respectively [94,95].

            "text": "Among these approaches, drug conjugates have become one of the interesting strategies to be implemented. The drug is attached to the carrier by a linker through covalent conjugation to render it inactive during circulation (Figure 1). Then, the drug is released through decomposition of the linker by either external or internal stimuli after reaching the tumor microenvironment. As seen in Figure 1, the carrier can have significant influences on the pharmacokinetic properties and may act as a targeting agent to reduce the off-target toxicity of the drug conjugates. There are many substrates that are eligible to be the carriers of the drug, for example, monoclonal antibodies (mAb), dendrimers, small ligands, polymers, nanoparticles, peptides, and many more [6]. On the other hand, the linker plays a determinant role in the drug conjugate cleavage, as well as affecting the stability, hydrophilicity, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of the overall drug molecule [7]. \n\nThere are two types of linkers developed so far, different in where the stimuli for the cleavage triggering mechanism are from. The internal trigger of the first type of linker takes advantage of the difference in systemic conditions between the normal tissue and the tumor microenvironment. For example, an acid-sensitive hydrazone linker becomes cleavable in the tumor tissue because of the lower pH condition, and enzyme cleavable, dipeptide, and disulfide linkers are susceptible to the overpresence of trigger enzymes such as cathepsin and glutathione (GSH) in the tumor environment. Although extensive progress has been made on internal trigger strategy, moderate stability and off-target release of the drug still restrict their therapeutic index due to the non-specific presence of the trigger in the non-target environment. Additionally, varying chemical environments between patients and lack of artificial control post-administration also become one of the main problems of this linker strategy. Therefore, there is an emerging interest in utilizing external triggers in drug delivery systems.",

To exert a maximum therapeutic effect on cancerous cells, we have conjugated two different payloads to different amino acids, cysteines (cys) and lysines (lys), on trastuzumab, which is a humanised anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody. First, trastuzumab was conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), an antimitotic agent, through a cleavable linker (Val-Cit) to prepare ADC (Tmab-VcMMAE). Then, the ADC (Tmab-VcMMAE) was conjugated with a second antimitotic agent, Mertansine (DM1), via a non-cleavable linker Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) to form a dual conjugate (Tmab-VcMMAE-SMCC-DM1). Our results indicated that the dual-payload conjugate, Tmab-VcMMAE-SMCC-DM1, had a synergistic and superior cytotoxic effect compared to trastuzumab alone. Ultimately employing a dual conjugation approach has the potential to overcome treatment-resistance and tumour recurrences and could pave the way to employ other payloads to construct dual (or multiple) payload complexes.",

            "text": "Targeted tumor therapy represents a valuable strategy for the selective and efficient treatment of tumors and their metastases. A promising targeted moiety for SMDC is the sea lamprey peptide hormone GnRH-III. Previous studies have shown that the lysine in position 8 offers a suitable conjugation side for different cytotoxic agents [7][8][9][10]. Furthermore, numerous oxime bond-linked GnRH-III-Dau derivatives with modified peptide sequence have been developed and analyzed to optimize the structure of the targeting peptide [10][11][12]. The high potential of the best candidates (I, II) as homing device in targeted tumor therapy could be confirmed in in vitro studies as well as in vivo on tumor-bearing mice [10,12,13,27]. \n\nAlthough non-cleavable linkers such as oximes provide a higher stability during circulation and show reduced off-target toxicity, 9 of 11 FDA-granted ADCs (status as of December 2021) comprise cleavable linker systems [18]. The main disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers is that the release of the payload depends on the proteolysis of the entire homing device. This is commonly accompanied with the remainder of the amino acid residues on the released payloads which can have an influence on the activity and the cell permeability [18]. The latter is important to elicit bystander effects, especially for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors [22,23]. \n\nConsidering that for the oxime bond-linked GnRH-III conjugates the smallest Daucontaining metabolite which is released by lysosomal enzymes possesses a lower cytotoxic potential than the free drug [28], the usage of cleavable linker systems might be favorable. Therefore, our aim was the development and evaluation of novel GnRH-III drug conjugates containing the cathepsin B-cleavable dipeptidyl linker Val-Ala or Val-Cit, and the self-immolative PABC moiety.",

            "text": "The site-directed chemical conjugation of antibodies remains an area of great interest and active efforts within the antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) community. We previously reported a unique site modification using a class of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) Fc-affinity reagents to establish a versatile, streamlined, and site-selective conjugation of native antibodies to enhance the therapeutic index of the resultant ADCs. This methodology, termed \u201cAJICAP\u201d, successfully modified Lys248 of native antibodies to produce site-specific ADC with a wider therapeutic index than the Food and Drug Administration-approved ADC, Kadcyla. However, the long reaction sequences, including the reduction\u2013oxidation (redox) treatment, increased the aggregation level. In this manuscript, we aimed to present an updated Fc-affinity-mediated site-specific conjugation technology named \u201cAJICAP second generation\u201d without redox treatment utilizing a \u201cone-pot\u201d antibody modification reaction. The stability of Fc affinity reagents was improved owing to structural optimization, enabling the production of various ADCs without aggregation. In addition to Lys248 conjugation, Lys288 conjugated ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratio of 2 were produced using different Fc affinity peptide reagent possessing a proper spacer linkage. These two conjugation technologies were used to produce over 20 ADCs from several combinations of antibodies and drug linkers. The in vivo profile of Lys248 and Lys288 conjugated ADCs was also compared. Furthermore, nontraditional ADC production, such as antibody\u2013protein conjugates and antibody\u2013oligonucleotide conjugates, were achieved. These results strongly indicate that this Fc affinity conjugation approach is a promising strategy for manufacturing site-specific antibody conjugates without antibody engineering.",

Incubation of the dual dye conjugates with HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 cells demonstrated the extracellular release of rhodamine and the intracellular release of fluorescein. With distinct extracellular and intracellular release triggers, this proof-of-concept study highlighted the potential for delivering drugs with differential spatial release from a single conjugate for cooperative drug combinations efficacies. \n\nResearchers at Pfizer reported a dual-payload conjugation method utilizing mTG in conjunction with engineered cysteines. 107 The goal of this research was to develop a solidphase conjugation method to facilitate high-throughput production of dual-payload conjugates. mAbs with engineered cysteine residues were first deglycosylated to expose the Q295 site for mTG conjugation. The IgGs were then immobilized on a protein A (ProA) resin, followed by conjugation with a BCN-containing adapter. Afterward, the immobilized antibody underwent reduction and reoxidation, resulting in the introduction of two chemically orthogonal reactive groups, strained alkyne (BCN) and thiol, on the antibody, primed for dual-payload conjugation (Figure 6b).

            "text": "fatality was attributed to the early release of the cargo. Heterogeneity induced by a variable drug antibody ratio (DAR) and aggregation in circulation caused by high DAR additionally limited the effectiveness of Mylotarg in the clinic (Clarke and Marks, 2010). Significant efforts have focused on these aforementioned problems. During the decade after Mylotarg first got approval, research mainly focused on site-specific linker technology for homogeneous ADC preparation (Tolcher, 2016). Approaches like enzyme-based siteselective coupling reaction, chemical agent-based site-selective coupling reaction, and DAR determination methods were also investigated. In addition, essential concepts including internalization rate, tumor tissue penetrability, bystander effect, and payload-induced antibody conformational instability were gradually recognized (Tolcher, 2016). Based on this research, the second-generation ADCs, for example Adcetris and Kadcyla, were designed, prepared, evaluated, and approved ( Fig. 1) (Garcia-Echeverria, 2014).\n\nCurrently, there are 12 ADC drugs marketed in the United States, and clinical research on many more ADCs is ongoing (Jin et al., 2021). More than that, several new preclinical studies on drug conjugates have emerged (Hafeez et al., 2020). This research has grown many new branches around solving problems with current conjugates and has brought about a variety of attractive new conjugate designs beyond the marketed ADC structures (Beck et al., 2017). Therefore, this review classifies the new preclinical development into three areas: (1) improvement to ADC components such as the antibody, linker, and payload; (2) identification of new targets for ADCs and other drug conjugates; and (3) evaluation of new targeting approaches (X-drug conjugates), where X can be small molecule, peptide, ligand, single-chain variable fragment (scFv), or nanoparticle. We hope this review will summarize the current state of the field and provide ideas for future research on drug conjugates.",

To characterize AZD8205 pharmacokinetics and biotransformation using both in vitro incubation and in vivo plasma samples in mice dosed with AZD8205, we employed intact and bottom-up approaches. Herein, we describe the comprehensive characterization of pharmacokinetics and biotransformation of these ADCs from both in vitro and in vivo samples, employing orthogonal approaches that provide complementary information.

            "text": "Cleavable linkers are most commonly used in the synthesis of ADCs and are designed to disengage the cytotoxic drug in response to changes in environmental conditions (pH, redox potential, GSH concentration, or enzymatic activity) that occur between the bloodstream, the tumor cells and the TME niche. They are stable under physiological conditions and, following the internalization of the ADC into the tumor cell, they are rapidly cleaved to ensure selective release of the cytotoxic preparation (Peters and Brown, 2015;Tsuchikama and An, 2018). In addition, these linkers are often cleaved in the TME because of its higher acidity and oxidative stress, making them the most used preparation to affect large solid masses barely impenetrable to full-size antibodies (Ponziani et al., 2020). Cleavable linkers are commonly divided into chemical (hydrazone and disulfide bonds) and enzyme (peptide bonds and glucuronide) cleavage linkers (Bargh et al., 2019). Hydrazone linkers are an example of acid-labile linkers used mainly in hematologic malignancies. They are usually stable in the physiological pH range of the blood circulation and undergo hydrolysis within the acidic microenvironment of the endosomes and lysosomes (pH 4.8-6.2) of the tumor cell (Jain et al., 2015). Similarly, linkers based on disulfide bonds are stable in the bloodstream alkaline environment, but payload release is sensitive to glutathione (GSH), a metabolite whose concentration is much higher in the cytoplasm of cancer cells (Balendiran et al., 2004;Estrela et al., 2006). However, both linkers raised concerns about their non-targeted cytotoxicity (Baah et al., 2021;Fu et al., 2022).",

Linkers should be highly stable in the blood circulation to allow the release and internalization of the ADC, though only upon antibody binding with the antigen. Unstable linkers may release the cytotoxic drug prematurely before reaching the tumor, hence, reducing the efficacy of the ADC treatment and increasing chances of off-target toxicity [35]. \n\nA linker can be classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable depending on its composition and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation within the cell. Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

If low-molecular cancer drugs were conjugated as a payload, they would be cut off from ADCs due to the bulkiness of mAb, shown in the curious case of AMG-595, below. Several linker cleavage systems have been developed [6]: (a) pH-sensitive cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, which can be cleaved in an acidic endosome, (b) reductively cleavable linkers, such as the disulfide bond, (c) enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as valinecitrulline dipeptide, (d) self-immolative linkers, such as the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl group, and (e) other mechanistically cleavable linkers, such as a photocleavable component. \n\nThe extracellular physiological pH is between 7.0 and 7.4. The pH in endosomes gradually reduces from the early endosome (pH of approximately 6.5) to the late endosome (pH of approximately 5.5) and, finally, lysosome (pH of approximately 4.5) by vacuolar H + -ATPase proton pumps. Thus, ideally, the linker of the anti-TfR mAb-cancer drug conjugate should be cleaved in endosomal acidification. In fact, pH-sensitive cleavable linkers were developed. At the same time, anti-TfR mAbs should be liberated from TfRs under weakly acidic conditions, without being degraded in lysosomes in the degradation pathway. When anti-TfR mAbs bind TfR too tightly, the resulting unliberated complexes are degraded into pieces in lysosomes by the lysosomal enzymes. Actually, the affinity of anti-TfR mAbs to TfR can be tuned so as to be separated as endosomal acidification.",

            "text": "However, they come with the limitation of potentially releasing highly cytotoxic payloads even when internalized by normal cells instead of target cells [13,14]. Glutathione-sensitive cleavable linkers react when glutathione levels are elevated. This leverages the fact that cells secrete glutathione during stress, and cancer cells produce more glutathione than normal cells [11]. An example is lorvotuzumab mertansine, a multiple myeloma drug currently undergoing clinical trials. It incorporates a CD56 antibody with a glutathione-sensitive cleavable linker and a tubulin inhibitor (Maytansinoid DM1) [37,38]. Additional enzyme cleavable linkers encompass peptide linkers, sulfatase linkers, and phosphatase linkers. Peptide linkers rely on proteases for cleavage, with the FDA-approved Hodgkin's lymphoma drug brentuximab vedotin using an CD30 antibody with a peptide cleavable linker and MMAE [39]. Furthermore, various enzyme-based linkers, such as \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b2-galactosidase linkers, have been developed [40][41][42][43] (Figure 4). These are degraded by enzymes present in lysosomes, rendering them more stable in the bloodstream compared to chemically cleavable linkers. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers, which remain intact within the lysosome post-internalization and do not undergo degradation, lead to antibody degradation by lysosomal peptidases. This, in turn, results in the release of payload and triggers cytotoxicity, causing cell death (Figure 3). Unlike their cleavable counterparts, non-cleavable linkers do not induce a bystander effect on neighboring cells in the bloodstream where peptidases are absent. Additionally, they offer enhanced plasma safety and greater resistance to proteolysis compared to cleavable linkers.",

The targeting component improves efficacy and protects non-target cells from the harmful effects of the payload. To date 15 ADCs have been approved by regulatory agencies for commercial use and shown to be valuable tools in the treatment of cancer. The assembly of an ADC requires the chemical ligation of a linker-payload to an antibody. Conventional conjugation methods targeting accessible lysines and cysteines have produced all the ADCs currently on the market. While successful, technologies aiming to improve the homogeneity and stability of ADCs are being developed and tested. Here we provide a review of developing methods for ADC construction. These include enzymatic methods, oligosaccharide remodelling, and technologies using genetic code expansion techniques. The virtues and limitations of each technology are discussed. Emerging conjugation technologies are being applied to produce new formats of ADCs with enhanced functionality including bispecific ADCs, dual-payload ADCs, and nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery. The benefits of these novel formats are highlighted.",

Depending on the linker type, the payload is released in either an endosome or a lysosome. Ultimately, the drug conjugate travels to the nucleus and exerts its cytotoxic mechanism on DNA, RNA or microtubules leading to cell death. In some instances when the cancer cells die, the drug conjugates of some ADCs like tisotumab vedotin and mirvetuximab soravtansine may exert their effect on nearby cancer cells in what is termed a bystander killing effect. \n\nThe goal of ADCs is to improve efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity via targeted delivery of cytotoxic therapy to cancer cells. However, on-target, off-tumor toxicities may occur when ADCs bind to non-cancer cells that also express the target (Chau et al., 2019 Aug 31). There are currently-two FDA approved ADCs for gynecological tumors, tisotumab vedotin and mirvetuximab soravtansine. Tisotumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to tissue factor, which is highly prevalent on cervical cancer cells and is implicated in tumor angiogenesis. The drug conjugate in tisotumab vedotin is a microtubuledisrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Tisotumab vedotin has a cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to the antibody in a drug to antibody ratio of four drug molecules to one antibody. \n\nMirvetuximab soravtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate directed to folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1), which is an important transmembrane protein responsible for folate transport into cells.",

            "text": "There are two types of linkers, cleavable and noncleavable. An appropriate linker is not only required to prevent degradation during systemic circulation but also to facilitate the quick and efficient release of the drug inside the tumor cells [35]. Non-cleavable linkers release their conjugated drug only after antibody degradation. For example, for Kadcyla which has a non-cleavable thioether linker, lysosomal membrane proteins are required to first transport the drug catabolite out of the lysosomal compartment & then exert a therapeutic effect [36]. Barok et al. [37] established that non-cleavable linkers are more susceptible to ADC resistance in tumor cells because any faulty linker degradation will not lead to functional drug release. \n\nBV is composed of protease-cleavable valine-citrulline peptide, where the MMAE does not depend on the degradation of the antibody backbone. Thus, it leads to much faster payload release after ADC internalization compared to a non-cleavable linker [38]. However, a faulty linker cleaving or non-cleaving can lead to an ineffective payload discharge. As per a study conducted by Caculitan et al. [39], valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker showed broad-spectrum specificity to different types of cathepsins, including cathepsin B, cathepsin L, cathepsin K, etc. [39]. Since only cathepsin B is postulated to be highly expressed in HL cells, and normal cells have other kinds of cathepsins, this phenomenon could be very deleterious as it would induce toxic side effects on other normal cells [40]. \n\nA defective linker thereby affects the cytotoxic drug delivery in many ways from the drug not reaching the target, to off-target toxicity and the drug not being able to dissociate from the mAb and the linker, thereby overall promoting resistance.

Therefore, the typical reversed-phase HPLC and hydrophobic interaction chromatography methods used to measure the drug to antibody ratio cannot be used to determine the oligo to antibody ratio (OAR) (96). \n\nIn addition to new types of payloads, much effort is going into improving linker technologies, which fall into two broad categories, cleavable and non-cleavable. Typically, an ADC is internalized into cells where the payload is released to kill the cell via the mechanism of the payload. How and when the payload is released is dependent on the linker design. There are many excellent reviews that cover linker development (99-102). Ideally the linker will be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity and maximize payload delivery to the tumor. The two approved ADCs with topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payloads, sacituzumab govitecan and fam-trastuzumab-deruxetan, provide interesting examples. \n\nSacituzumab govitecan, an anti-Trop 2-CL2A-SN38 ADC with an average DAR of 7-8 uses a hydrolysable linker where the SN38 payload is released in serum at 37\u00b0C with a half-life of ~1 day. This release rate was determined to be important for activity and results in a bystander effect on nearby cells in addition to killing by internalization (103). \n\nFam-trastuzumab-deruxetan, with an average DAR of 8, is approved for tumors with variable levels of HER2 expression, unlike other HER2 targeted mAbs.",

To bring the chemically reactive site in proximity to K317 a \ue104exible PEG 20 spacer was introduced at the N-terminus of the Fc-III peptide. The average length of the PEG spacer was estimated to be 23.8 \u00c5 \n\nbased on the WLC model. The carbonate moiety was selected as the chemically reactive site to confer sufficient stability to the Fc-III reactive conjugate in water (contrary to succinimidyl esters) and to yield a carbamate linkage between the antibody and the payload, which has shown good stability in clinically relevant ADC drug linkers such as vedotin (estimated half-life of 4 to 6 days in humans). 38 Next to the chemically reactive site, a pcarboxy phenyl reactivity modulator was engineered to jointly ensure the high reactivity of the carbonate, as well as sufficient stability towards aqueous hydrolysis. For example, when an mnitro moiety was added to the p-carboxy phenyl, the carbonate reactivity was highly increased, but the susceptibility to water hydrolysis became too high to be used successfully (data not shown). Most importantly, the p-carboxy phenyl moiety also plays the role of a leaving group as it enables the release of the Fc-III ligand during the ligation of the chelator to the antibody, and not inversely, a side reaction that would happen otherwise given the symmetry of the carbonate (Fig. 1C). Altogether, the Fc-III reactive conjugate presented here is designed to regioselectively label the antibody at K317 with a payload, together with the concomitant release of Fc-III.",

However, its image quality is largely limited by the low signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and low penetration depth caused by light scattering and tissue autofluorescence. [87] o overcome this issue and further facilitate precise imageguided theranostics, stimuli-responsive linkers have been applied to design activatable optical imaging probes for monitoring biomarkers related immunoactivation, disease progression, drug release, and cancer treatment efficacy. These linkers can be cleaved via exposure to the specific tumor microenvironment conditions (e.g. disease-associated enzymes, glutathione (GSH), RONS etc.) or specific light and metal ions, leading to the activation and turn-on of the fluorescence signals. Thus, cleavage of linkers causes the followed activation of fluorescence signals restricted to local tumor lesions while remained silent in normal tissues, which resulted in higher SBR values and better accuracy. Therefore, it is of great significance to utilize responsive cleavable linkers to specifically activate optical imaging probes for highly sensitive and highresolution imaging. Herein, we summarize the applications of responsive linkers in optical imaging including fluorescence imaging, chemiluminescence, and dual-locked imaging, revealing the potential for responsive linkers.",

There is evidence from the literature 20 that a 4-methylpiperazine-1-carbamate moiety at this position of a CBI unit will cleave in vivo to release the phenolic group, thus leading to activation of the CBI (i.e., spirocyclisation) for adenine alkylation. In addition, the electrophilic N11-C12 imine moiety of the PDD unit was converted to a prodrug form by incorporating its N11-position into the paraaminobenzylcarbamate (PABC) linkage, thus preventing unwanted reaction with nucleophiles prior to reaching the target cancer cells. In constructs of this type, the PABC functionality has been shown to self-immolate in a cascade initiated by protease-catalysed cleavage of the Val-Ala linker, thus releasing the cytotoxic payload upon internalisation of the ADC in tumour cells 28 .

S8-S12 and Supplementary Results S13 for characterisation and analytical data).\n\nThe Linker-Payload construct (FGX16- 11,9) was then conjugated to the EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody cetuximab with a Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR) of~2, using standard stochastic reductive conjugation methodology 29 to provide the ADC cetuximab-(FGX16-11) (10). Due to the hydrophobicity of the maleimide-linker-payload 9, it was not possible to produce a higher DAR under the conjugation conditions used. However, it should be possible to produce",

            "text": "In addition, the conjugation of gemcitabine with an enzymatically cleavable linker facilitated the controlled intracellular drug release by lysosomal cathepsin B protease (Figures 2 and 3). Moreover, by incorporating TNM dendrimer structures, three gemcitabine molecules were added to each Apt-cL-triGemcitabine, promoting efficient drug delivery with a high drug payload. \n\nThe clinical utility of chemotherapeutics is constrained by the tolerability of their side effects. Due to the fact that side effects typically arise from off-target cytotoxicity, therapeutic strategies that minimize off-target activity can facilitate higher dosing and, by extension, greater therapeutic effect. Our central objective was to develop a novel chemotherapeutic with specific anti-tumor activity in TNBC cells but limited activity in healthy tissue. To this end, we hypothesized that the chemotherapeutic could be stabilized with chemical moieties that prevent extracellular drug release. In the past, the clinical adoption of aptamer therapeutics has been hindered by instability and unpredictable behavior in vivo. To prevent aptamer release of gemcitabine in circulation, we incorporated cleavable peptide linkers into the TNM dendrimer vehicle. These linkers, commonly used in antibody-drug conjugate development, are enzymatically cleaved by activated cathepsin B in lysosomes. Notably, our study reveals that, by incorporating gemcitabine into the TNM vehicle using these cleavable linkers, the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine was markedly reduced relative to free drug (Figure 5), which may increase its drug delivery safety profile.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising class of therapeutic treatments. The combination of a selective antibody and cytotoxic payload in the form of an ADC has been hailed as a \"magic bullet\" given their promise to dramatically improve treatments [1,2]. While a variety of different modalities, including site-specific ADCs, are under development and in clinical trials, all ADCs that have received FDA approval fall into the categories of either cysteine-or lysine-linked ADCs [3]. The use of either reduced cysteines or solvent-accessible lysine residues as conjugation sites adds heterogeneity to the antibodies, increasing the challenges of characterization. Recent advances in mass spectrometry techniques have resulted in enhanced structural characterization of ADCs as well as improved differentiation of positional isomers with middle-down techniques [4,5]. However, the translation of these methods to lysine-linked ADCs has been limited. \n\nThe complexity of an ADC and the difficulty associated with its characterization arises largely from the modality of the payload-to-antibody linkage. The least complex cases are site-specific or next-generation ADCs, which utilize modified amino acid residues, typically on the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the heavy chain (HC), to link the payload to a small number (two or four) of specific amino acids [6]. Cysteine-linked ADCs typically contain an average of four payloads attached to interchain disulfide bonds, resulting in eight possible conjugation sites per ADC [6]. Finally, lysine-linked ADCs are derived from linker conjugation to random lysine residues along the entire amino acid sequence of the antibody [6]. The large number of lysine residues on antibodies, typically around 90 in total, increases the challenge of characterizing lysine-linked ADCs. \n\nDespite the challenges, significant strides have been made to improve the characterization of ADCs.",

In this case cytotoxic agent (payload) is connected to the tumor-targeting carrier via a cleavable (stimuli responsive) or non-cleavable linker. Tumor-targeting carrier may be an antibody, a protein, or a peptide and the resulting conjugates are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), protein-drug conjugates (PrDCs) and peptide-drug conjugates (PeDCs). A key factor, in the design of all these conjugates is the linker which influences the stability of the conjugate, modulates the release of the cytotoxic agent and the pharmacokinetics [232][233][234][235][236]. \n\nADCs with humanized antibodies showed low immunogenicity and better half-lives in comparison with ones with murine antibodies, but due to size and complex structure their use is somehow limited to hematologic malignancies and rarely to solid tumors. By means of PEGylation certain properties of anti-bodies can be modified (increased halflives and reduced immunogenicity). Nowadays there are twelve ADCs approved by FDA (starting with Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, more than two decades ago) [236][237][238][239]. \n\nPrDCs ensures improved pharmacokinetics, long blood residence and reduced toxicity by selective distribution in targeted cells. Physicochemical criteria are used to identify suitable proteins for conjugation. Several PrDCs (with albumin, transferrin, gelatin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, insulin, etc.,) are now in preclinical or clinical phases of clinical trials [236,[240][241][242][243][244]. Some limitations of ADCs and PrDCs may be avoided by using PeDCs.",

Alternatively, when two bioactive small molecules are joined without a linker, fused multi-targeting ligands are obtained.

Schematic representation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) approach for cancer therapy. An ADC comprises three key components: 1) the antibody (Ab) targeting a specific cell; 2) the linker; 3) the cytotoxic drug. They work synergistically to enable precise delivery of the cytotoxic agent to the target cell. ADCs are engineered to stay stable in the bloodstream and release the drug inside cells after binding to a specific antigen. The antibody needs to exhibit high binding affinity to the specific target antigen, low immunogenicity, stability in the bloodstream, and minimal cross-reactivity. The linker connects the antibody to the cytotoxic payload via covalent conjugation, ensuring stability in the bloodstream and enabling quick release of the drug at the target site. Successful ADC development also relies on the drug-antibody ratio (DAR), which quantifies the number of drug molecules attached to the antibody via the linker.",

Val-Cit-PAB (Valine-Citrulline-p-aminobenzylalcohol) is a peptide linker widely used for ADC development as it has good stability in plasma but remains labile to lysosomal enzymes, such as Cathepsin B. Glycan-bridged conjugation presents another possibility to design enzyme-mediated payload release through the activity of glycosidases. For example, the endoglycosidase from Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Endo S) cleaves IgG glycans by hydrolyzing the \u03b21\u22124 linkage between the GlcNAc residues in the chitobiose core. 52,53 It is a secreted enzyme that can efficiently deglycosylate humoral IgG, which contributes to the pathogenicity of the pathogen. 53 hus, this enzyme would potentially release payloads from our ADC. To test this, we incubated the mouse IgG-MMAE ADC with Endo S for 2 h and observed the full removal of the glycan-payload moiety (Figure 4A,B). The treatment of Cathepsin B under the same buffer condition also released the MMAE payload from the Val-Cit-PAB cleavable site. In comparison, the ADC analogue without the Val-Cit-PAB linker (mouse IgG-PEG8-MMAE) tolerated Cathepsin B treatment but not Endo S treatment. These results suggested that it is possible to achieve glycosidase-dependent payload release using glycan-bridged conjugation strategies. It could be designed for antibacterial ADC development against species secreting endoglycosidase (e.g., S. pyogenes). \n\nNext, we studied the linker stability and ADC degradation rate in the physiological environment by using a plasma stability assay.",

Since it maintains the https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2024.714 pISSN 1598-2998, eISSN 2005-9256 Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutics that structurally are composed by an antibody directed to a tumor epitope connected via a linker to a cytotoxic payload, and that have shown significant antitumor activity across a range of malignancies including lung cancer. In this article we review the pharmacology and design of ADCs, as well as we describe the results of different studies evaluating ADCs in lung cancer directed to several targets including HER2, HER3, TROP2, MET, CEACAM5 and DLL3. \n\nADCs stability within the bloodstream, in plays a double role in both the toxicity and the activity profile of ADCs. Linker instability in this setting can lead to inappropriate or premature release of the cytotoxic payload and, in consequence, considerable toxicity. Conversely, an effective linker must also successfully release the cytotoxic payload once the ADC is internalized by the targeted cell; instead, the clinical activity of the ADC can be rather diminished [10]. \n\nLinkers are categorized into cleavable or non-cleavable according to their mechanism of payload release [11]: cleavable linkers degrade and release the cytotoxic payload on the basis of certain intracellular factors, such as acidity, glutathione reduction or the presence of lysosomal proteases leading to peptide cleavage [12,13]; on the other side, noncleavable linkers are formed by non-reducible bonds with the antibody amino-acid residues, leading to higher stability within the systemic circulation, and they release the payload through lysosomal-dependent degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex [14].",

Since the reagent was designed to bear two orthogonal handles, a strained and a terminal alkyne, the rebridged antibody could be further functionalized via successive SPAAC and CuAAC, yielding immunoconjugates with two different payloads per reconstructed disulfide bond. \n\nBased on these results, new PD reagents were also designed to afford homogeneous antibody conjugates with lower DAR. DAR4 conjugates were obtained by only adding a single functionalization site on PD, like the strained alkyne in PD 168 or the drug MMAE in PD 169, resulting in the generation of a panel of PD with very effective rebridging abilities-less than 5% of half-antibody was generally detected, and homogeneous DAR4 ADC could be produced in excellent yield [217,218]. Connecting two PD together with a PEG linker-whose length was critical for the successful outcome of the strategy-allowed the simultaneous rebridging of two disulfides on trastuzumab, while the incorporation of one (171) or two (170) terminal alkynes per PD dimer offered a selective access to DAR2 or DAR4 conjugates, respectively [219]. Further optimization of pyridazinediones led to valuable applications, such as the possibility of conducting disulfide reduction and rebridging in a single step with 'two-in-one' reagents [220], or the generation of homogeneous bispecific Fab fragments conjugates [221]. \n\nAnother rebridging reagent, the dibromo oxetane derivative 172, was proposed in 2017 by Bernardes and co-workers [222]. Albeit being deprived of a functional handle for further derivatization of the resulting protein conjugates, dibromooxetanes proved to be effective for the stapling of cysteine residues in different proteins, including antibody fragments.",

            "text": "Accordingly, enzyme-sensitive linkers provide a more precise release of the drug in the tumor milieu while also offering enhanced systemic stability than the chemical labile type due to their inertia at physiological conditions and protection by serum protease inhibitors [2,25,32,43,44]. However, while the extracellular cleavage of protease-labile linkers, e.g., by TME enzymes, may contribute to amplifying the ADC-induced anticancer effect by facilitating the above-stated bystander effect, it can also increase dose-limiting adverse effects (e.g., myelosuppression) due to premature drug release by blood cell proteases, like neutrophil elastases, as seen for Val-Cit-PABC linkers [51]. Furthermore, while Val-containing linkers are generally reasonably stable in human plasma, they have been shown to be susceptible to carboxylesterase 1C (Ces1C) in mouse and rat plasma [43,52]. Therefore, to allow for preclinical ADC evaluation in rodent models, considerable research efforts have been directed toward designing linkers with superior mouse plasma stability, either by structural optimization or by developing novel cleavable linker structures, as detailed below and thoroughly reviewed in [53]. \n\nCompared to cleavable linkers, the non-cleavable types, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl groups, are devised to release the cytotoxic payload only after complete lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, instead of the neutral payload, a \"complex\" of the drug linked to an amino acid residue of an antibody degradation product is released upon processing [2,25,32,43,44]. Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44].",

We demonstrate that this linker enhances yield/labeling density while mitigating the formation of aggregated conjugates when compared to PAB strategies. Importantly, unlike the PAB approach, this cleavage chemistry can be applied not only to conventional proteolytic cleavage but also to terminal hypoxia responsive nitroaryl triggering groups. While we have implemented this strategy without site-specific conjugation, it holds promise for integration with various other conjugation methods. 60] Ultimately, the BAC-based linker may facilitate the devel-",

Initially, a DBCO-containing linker payload was conjugated to the antibody, followed by maleimide conjugation. Both SPAAC and maleimide conjugation exhibit rapid kinetics, allowing the conjugation reaction to reach near completion within hours (Figure 5c). While the DAR of the maleimide linker payload remains fixed, the overall DAR can be adjusted by modulating the number of pAMF sites (Table 4). Additionally, by alternating the DBCO and maleimide linker payloads, diverse scaffold configurations, including 8 + 2, 8 + 4, 8 + 8, 4 + 8, and 2 + 8, can be achieved. The generation of a library of 19 dual-payload ADCs using non-canonical cyclopentadiene-containing amino acids and interchain cysteine residues on trastuzumab was demonstrated. A range of DAR from 1.0 to 7.1 was achieved through cysteine conjugation. 114 This work is worth mentioning as it explores a variety of drug combinations involving MMAE, alvespimycin, aldoxorubicin, vinblastine, and doxorubicin, although these conjugates are not considered homogeneous.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have begun to fulfil their promise as targeted cancer therapeutics with ten clinical approvals to date. As the field matures, much attention has focused upon the key factors required to produce safe and efficacious ADCs. Recently the role that linker-payload reagent design has on the properties of ADCs has been highlighted as an important consideration for developers. We have investigated the effect of incorporating hydrophilic macrocycles into reagent structures on the in vitro and in vivo behavior of ADCs. Bis-sulfone based disulfide rebridging reagents bearing Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE linker-payloads were synthesized with a panel of cyclodextrins and crown ethers integrated into their structures via a glutamic acid branching point. Brentuximab was selected as a model antibody and ten ADCs with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 were prepared for biological evaluation. In vitro, the ADCs prepared showed broadly similar potency (range: 16\u201334 pM) and were comparable to Adcetris\u00ae (16 pM). In vivo, the cyclodextrin containing ADCs showed greater efficacy than Adcetris\u00ae and the most efficacious variant (incorporating a 3\u2032-amino-\u03b1-cyclodextrin component) matched a 24-unit poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) containing comparator. The ADCs bearing crown ethers also displayed enhanced in vivo efficacy compared to Adcetris\u00ae, the most active variant (containing a 1-aza-42-crown-14 macrocycle) was superior to an analogous ADC with a larger 24-unit PEG chain. In summary, we have demonstrated that hydrophilic macrocycles can be effectively incorporated into ADC reagent design and offer the potential for enhanced alternatives to established drug-linker architectures.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a new class of cancer therapeutics that deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to tumors (1,2). An ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody, cytotoxic drug (payload), and linkers to conjugate the antibody and payload. This results in damage specifically to cancer cells expressing the target antigen of the antibody, thereby reducing off-target cytotoxic effects. Currently, there are 11 ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a considerable number in clinical trials (3,4). \n\nADCs induce a pharmacological effect through a multistep process which includes binding to the cell surface antigen, internalization into endosomes/lysosomes, catabolism to release the payload, and escape from lysosomes (1). Although internalization is a common rate-limiting step for payload release from ADCs, additional steps may occur depending on whether the linker types are cleavable or noncleavable (5). The ADCs conjugated with cleavable linkers are decomposed in the endosomes or lysosomes after internalization to yield the payload, which is generally highly membrane permeable and readily diffuses from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. In contrast, those with noncleavable linkers are not cleaved, producing a linker-bound payload, which is a high molecular weight complex and comparably hydrophilic because of the conjugated amino acid residue at the terminus (6,7). Hence, the linker-bound payload is considered impermeable and requires carriers, such as transporters, to be released from the lysosomes. \n\nTrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a successful noncleavable ADC that has been widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (8,9).",

            "text": "Three different linker chemistries for attaching the peptide to the CpG oligonucleotide were explored and evaluated for their effect on the activation and proliferation of both APCs and CD8 + effector T cells: a non-cleavable linker (N-(\u03b2-maleimidopropyloxy) succinimide ester, BMPS); a cleavable linker (succinimidyl 3-(2pyridyldithio)propionate, SPDP), which upon cleavage under reducing conditions within the endosome, leaves a molecular pendant group (3-mercaptopropionamide) attached to the antigen; and a traceless linker (4-nitrophenyl 2-(2-pyridyldithio)ethyl carbonate, NDEC), which upon reduction, engages in intramolecular cyclization followed by the release of the antigen in an unmodified form. All SNA architectures robustly co-delivered the adjuvant and antigen to APCs and effectively activated the APCs, suggesting that the linker chemistry does not impact SNA uptake endosomal TLR9 activation within APCs. Using T cell receptor transgenic CD8 + T cells that specifically recognize gp100, SNAs with a traceless linker most effectively induced effector T cell expansion and activation by promoting IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, granzyme-B, and IL-6 production [64]. Further optimization of the reduction-labile traceless linker showed that accelerating the rates of chemical dissociation of antigens from CpG oligonucleotide-peptide conjugates resulted in more potent immunostimulatory SNAs [65]. Taken together, these proof-of-concept studies highlight the power of SNA-enabled vaccines to co-deliver the adjuvant and antigen to immune cells, and to more potently enhance APC activation and the priming of antigen-specific T cells compared to linear cues. These data also show that the choice of linker chemistry impacts peptide antigenicity and T cell activation and expansion and showcase the importance of adjuvant/antigen structural arrangements for eliciting potent immune responses.",

            "text": "options are broadly categorized into cleavable and noncleavable linkers, there are several different functional groups and/or trigger points that can be used for either category of linkers. In a data-driven approach, several linkers were explored representing both cleavable and non-cleavable formats to determine the optimal choice for delivering a STING agonist via an ADC. In evaluating the different linkers, the corresponding ADCs were assessed for their analytical properties [hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC)], in vitro activity, in Table 2. STING Activity with Analogs 18a\u2212e and 19a\u2212d vivo PK, anti-tumor activity, and impact on off-target activity. Other parameters, such as payload and antibody, were held constant as the linker was evaluated.\n\nIn an attempt to assess the best possible linker from each respective class, several criteria were considered. For example, an ester attachment is known to be susceptible to potential metabolism, as exemplified by ADC 36 ( Figure 5A), which has an unhindered ester bond. Addition of an alanine adjacent to the ester bond resulted in more stable ADC 37 and nearly 2fold improvement in exposure of the conjugated drug ( Figure  5B). However, even more hindered amino acids, such as the valine in ADC 38, did not result in an improved PK profile compared to 37. Whereas ADCs 36\u221238 leverage 6 as the payload, ADC 39, which employs a cleavable peptide-based linker, uses 4 as the payload. For assessing the non-cleavable linker, the scaffold, which attenuates the biophysical properties of the ADC, was removed as it was expected to detrimentally impact the activity of the released payload due to its large size ( Figure 5C). Activity of the anticipated released payload 41 ( Figure 5C) from ADC 40 was tested and confirmed to be similar to the payload released from 37 (payload 6), with similar binding (as assessed by SPR, see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) and an EC 50 value of 5 nM in the permeabilized THP1 cell assay. Although 40 was more hydrophobic (as",

            "text": "Activity expression by the payloads of ADCs assumes two scenarios, such as (i) the liberation of payloads after linker cleavage, or (ii) no structural alteration of ADCs, including bispecific mAbs or ADC with relatively bare payloads, such as idursulfase beta. If low-molecular cancer drugs were conjugated as a payload, they would be cut off from ADCs due to the bulkiness of mAb, shown in the curious case of AMG-595, below. Several linker cleavage systems have been developed [6]: (a) pH-sensitive cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, which can be cleaved in an acidic endosome, (b) reductively cleavable linkers, such as the disulfide bond, (c) enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as valine-citrulline dipeptide, (d) self-immolative linkers, such as the para-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl group, and (e) other mechanistically cleavable linkers, such as a photocleavable component. \n\nThe extracellular physiological pH is between 7.0 and 7.4. The pH in endosomes gradually reduces from the early endosome (pH of approximately 6.5) to the late endosome (pH of approximately 5.5) and, finally, lysosome (pH of approximately 4.5) by vacuolar H + -ATPase proton pumps. Thus, ideally, the linker of the anti-TfR mAb-cancer drug conjugate should be cleaved in endosomal acidification. In fact, pH-sensitive cleavable linkers were developed. At the same time, anti-TfR mAbs should be liberated from TfRs under weakly acidic conditions, without being degraded in lysosomes in the degradation pathway. When anti-TfR mAbs bind TfR too tightly, the resulting unliberated complexes are degraded into pieces in lysosomes by the lysosomal enzymes. Actually, the affinity of anti-TfR mAbs to TfR can be tuned so as to be separated as endosomal acidification.",

The ratio of reaction products is controlled by the ratio of starting compounds. These azido intermediates containing one, two, or three oligonucleotide moieties are easily separable by PAGE or HPLC, and are therefore readily available as pure individual compounds. The latter can be easily converted into the corresponding aptamer-payload conjugates (Scheme 4). The payload is introduced into the modification step as an alkyne-modified cleavable linker-based derivative. Almost all common enzymatically cleavable linkers and toxic payloads tolerate CuAAC conditions, thus making the approach versatile and suitable for the full range of available linkers and payloads, including potential new ones [78]. Moreover, this modular principle can be further developed in the future for the construction of conjugates carrying two different payloads or peptides to enhance transport across the BBB. \n\nWe found that the branched aptamer conjugates were more potent than their 1:1 analog. The combination of two payloads in one conjugate with different cellular targets is considered as a promising approach to overcome tumor resistance to therapy [30,78,79]. The development of peptides/proteins targeting the transferrin receptor is a hot topic for drug delivery to the brain [80][81][82]. Therefore, we will continue to develop synthetic approaches for conjugates containing recognizing, transport-enhancing, and therapeutic moieties.",

There are, however, no measurable changes observed between the half-life of Adcetris \u00ae with a cleavable linker and Kadcyla \u00ae with non-cleavable linker at the clinical level [156,157]. \n\nThe linker property will also determine how the final products act during blood circulation and also touch the sensitivity of the antibody to environmental stresses [158]. Some disulfide-linked ADCs were found to conjugate with blood proteins through cleaved free thiols. Hydrophobic linkers and payloads frequently encourage the aggregation of ADC molecules, e.g., King et al. showed that multiple loading of the BR96 antibody that is simultaneously attached to doxorubicin drug leads to non-covalent dimerization of the antibody, which will eventually lead to hepatotoxicity [159,160]. It has also been seen that the linkers that are more hydrophobic are not able to significantly affect the MDR1 + cells. Instead, linkers with a more polar and amphiphilic nature were able to appear with a greater effect such as mal-PEG4-N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-(2-pyridyldithio)-2-sulfobutanoate (sulfo-SPDB) [161]. In addition to the MDR1 challenge, it has also been found that reducing the percentage of hydrophobicity by employing hydrophilic linkers containing negatively charged sulfonate groups, polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, or pyrophosphate diester groups can also help in improving therapeutic index level and pharmacokinetics [162].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a significant advance in targeted cancer therapy, merging the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity of small molecule drugs. By harnessing the targeting capability of antibodies, ADCs deliver toxic agents directly to tumor cells, minimizing the impact on healthy tissues and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. This targeted approach reduces the systemic toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life. ADCs are composed of three main components: an antibody specific to tumor antigens, a cytotoxic drug, and a linker that connects the drug to the antibody. The design of each component is critical. The antibody must target an antigen that is predominantly expressed on cancer cells, ensuring high specificity. The linker technology is equally vital, as it must be stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the toxin but cleavable within the tumor environment to release the cytotoxic agent once the ADC reaches its target. \n\nThe innovative aspect of ADCs lies in their ability to exploit the natural properties of antibodies to seek out and bind to specific antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Once an ADC binds to its target antigen, it is internalized by the cancer cell, whereupon the linker is cleaved, releasing the cytotoxic drug. This allows the drug to exert its lethal effect at the heart of the tumor cell, maximizing tumor cell kill while sparing normal cells. \n\nThe development of ADCs has been bolstered by advances in engineering more stable linkers and more potent cytotoxins, which can kill cancer cells at lower doses. Innovations in antibody engineering and linker chemistry have expanded the therapeutic window of ADCs, enabling the treatment of a broader range of cancers with improved safety profiles. \n\nOne of the ADCs making waves in clinical trials is Mipasetamab uzoptirine (Mipa), targeting AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in various tumor processes, including growth, metastasis, and resistance to agents. AXL overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a valuable target for ADC therapy.",

The first generation principally encompasses conventional chemotherapeutic agents, mouse-derived antibodies, and non-cleavable linkers, which are plagued by numerous limitations including unstable linkers, antibody aggregation, and heterogeneous agents. The second-generation ADCs leverage IgG1 isotype monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cytotoxic payloads with increased potency, and optimized linkers, collectively enhancing the therapeutic index of these conjugates. The third generation features precisely characterized drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) of either 2 or 4 and deploys fully humanized antibodies to minimize immunogenicity [73]. Collectively, advancements in ADCs are highly contingent upon the iterative optimization of these components. However, due to the large molecular weight of ADC compared with other cytotoxic drugs, the efficiency of drug penetration remains a limitation [73]. Current research foci include the identification of novel targets, introduction of polyclonal antibodies, and the design of payloads with greater tumor-specific toxicity and enhanced stability. As for linkers, the emphasis is on developing ones that degrade selectively within neoplastic tissues, sparing normal cells.",

            "text": "In recent decades, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to diseased cells and tissues, and not to healthy ones, has been made possible by nanotechnology approaches 94 or by drug conjugates featuring a targeting moiety. 95 Antibody\u2212drug conjugates (ADCs) are generally comprised of an antibody (Ab) conjugated to a cytotoxic payload via a chemical linker. 96 hree ADC therapeutics (trastuzumab emtansine, brentuximab vedotin, and inotuzumab ozogamicin) are already on the market, and several others are being investigated in clinical trials. 97 More recently, small molecule\u2212drug conjugates (SMDCs) have provided an opportunity for targeted delivery. Typically, SMDCs feature three parts, i.e., a targeting ligand, a cleavable linker, and a therapeutically active small molecule. Targeted drug conjugates act by recognizing target cells through overexpressed receptors and, once internalized, selectively releasing the therapeutic agent. In most cases, release occurs following linker cleavage by intracellular thiols 98 or by using selfimmolative linkers responsive to specific stimuli, such as pH, redox system, and light. 94,99 s mentioned earlier, PROTACs effect highly efficient protein degradation and represent a unique therapeutic strategy. However, when addressing target proteins expressed in most of tissues, PROTACs may lack selectivity. Clearly, tissue-or organspecific degradation can be achieved by exploiting differential biology and expression levels of E3 ligases. 35 Another possibility is the development of a site-or tissue-specific delivery system that can reduce potential toxicity and increase the therapeutic window and eventually the translatability into the clinical setting. Thus, PROTAC conjugates have attracted considerable attention for targeted delivery (Figure 10). \n\nIn the following sections, (i) antibody-(Figure 10A) and (ii) small molecule-PROTAC conjugates (Figure 10B) will be discussed from the viewpoint of a double modality. \n\n5.1.

            "text": "Although the study was focused on the characterization of the side-products of CuAAC, it shares multiple features applicable for determination of NP-peptide conjugates in complex proteomic samples. \n\nRecently, an isoDTB linker was introduced, which is synthetically easily accessible and now as well commercially available. IsoDTB combines the desthiobiotin moiety and isotopically labeled residues for direct quantification (Figure 9A) [103]. Thus far, the linker has been mainly utilized for profiling of reactive cysteines. For this review the labile and open search of the data acquired by Zanon et al. using the FragPipe suite led to identification of several anticipated diagnostic ions, including the b-type ions from fragmented peptide bonds of the linker (Figure 9A). The study builds on the reactivity of free cysteine thiols, which are reacted on the proteome-wide level with iodoacetamide-alkyne via S N reaction. Similar as for the abovedescribed DTB-linker, several probe-derived ions were observed (Figure 9B). The isoDTB-linker's availability in 'light' and 'heavy' form together with highly optimized protocols and direct presets in MSFragger for streamlined analysis make this linker a feasible choice for site identifications of probe-peptide conjugates. \n\nAn alternative approach to selectively release the probe-peptide conjugates after the affinity enrichment is the utilization of a cleavable linker [52]. From the plethora of cleavable linkers reviewed by Beard et al., we focus here on selected few, which were used in recent studies with sufficient resolution and depth [52]. In general, cleavable linkers can be divided into two main groups based on the cleavage mechanism, which can be either enzymatic or chemical. The advantage of cleavable linkers is the possibility to combine stringent enrichment, ensured by the biotin-streptavidin complex, with the selective release of modified peptide-probe conjugates afterwards.",

            "text": "The linker, a crucial component of ADCs, precisely conjugates cytotoxic agents to mAbs. Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120]. Linkers are generally categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (Fig. 5).",

            "text": "In this review, we have described the most important and recent examples of antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs) containing metal-based and nature-inspired payloads. Particular emphasis has been placed on the different synthetic strategies that can be employed to conjugate the antibody with the selected payload, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Conventional methods, such as maleimide and succinimide conjugation methods, as well as classical condensation reactions, are the ones most commonly used for both metallodrugs and bioactive natural compounds payloads. However, alternative strategies, such as photoconjugation reactions, are rapidly evolving. These non-conventional methods allow for milder conditions and render the formation of target ADCs more selective, thereby limiting the side reactions and/or mixtures of ADCs, which are difficult to separate and identify. \n\nIn addition to the different synthetic pathways, we have summarized the therapeutic/diagnostic properties of ADCs bearing metal-based and nature-inspired payloads, as reported by the various authors. Most of the reviewed contributions highlighted that ADCs exhibit a more selective therapeutic activity towards cancer cells/tissues compared to non-conjugated payloads, as well as reduced side effects in animal models. \n\nIn summary, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a rapidly evolving frontier in oncology and targeted therapy, with a future that promises significant advancements in cancer treatment. The innovative design of ADCs, which combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs, offers a targeted approach which can be used to destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. This precise mechanism of action has already shown impressive clinical efficacy in treating various malignancies, and ongoing research and development efforts suggest an even more transformative impact in the coming years. The future of ADCs looks particularly promising due to several key factors: (i) Advances in linker technology, which connects the antibody to the drug, are expected to enhance the stability and controlled release of the cytotoxic agent. Improved linkers will increase the therapeutic window and reduce off-target effects, making ADCs safer and more effective.",

Incorporating the gem-dimethyl group into the disulfide linker reduced the clearance by more than 40 times (0.951 to 0.02 mL/h for PDP vs SS[gem-dimethyl] as shown in Table S3), suggesting that increased bulk slows down disulfide cleavage in circulation. Similar results have been observed with ADCs demonstrating the impact of disulfide linker length and steric hindrance on PK and efficacy. 41,42 The rest of this manuscript will focus on noncleavable (stable) linkers other than the data shown in Figure 9. \n\nFurther Exploration of Non-cleavable Linkers (MCC, CB, MB, and BisMal). \u03b1hEGFR-siKRAS AOC In Vitro Stability. To compare the in vitro stability of different noncleavable linkers, we conjugated a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody targeting EGFR (\u03b1hEGFR) to KRAS siRNA using four different noncleavable linkers (MCC, CB, MB, and BisMal). We tested the linker stability by observing siRNA release from the antibody after incubating it at 37 \u00b0C in PBS with 0.5 mM glutathione (Figure S3). Free antibody was measured by using strong-anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography to indicate the loss of KRAS siRNA.",

            "text": "In recent years, antibody-drug conjugates have become valuable assets in the field of molecularly targeted medicine. Antibody-drug conjugates are complex biological entities that combine a surface receptor-targeting antibody with a cytotoxic chemical [24]. This reduces the adverse effects on healthy cells/tissue that expresses minimal or no levels of the targeted antigen and enables the targeted distribution and internalization of a toxic payload by tumor cells that express the antigens targeted by the ADC (Fig. 2) [25]. Additionally, the chemical structure of the linker imparts distinct qualities to the various ADCs [24,25]. Antigen-depleting drugs featuring noncleavable thioether linkers necessitate internalization and degradation by lysosomes to exhibit their antitumor properties without causing harm to adjacent antigennegative cells [25]. In contrast, ADCs including cleavable linkers have the potential to discharge a portion of their lethal payload into the tumor microenvironment, resulting in the death of antigen-positive target cells as well as adjacent antigen-negative cells through the bystander effect. A multitude of tumor-antigens that are differently expressed in ovarian cancers are amenable to this innovative approach [26]. ADCs consist of three constituent elements: a synthetic chemical linker, a cytotoxic payload, and an antibody. Each component of an ADC contributes to a distinct characteristic, namely tumor selectivity, cytotoxicity, and biodistribution. The selection and formulation of individual components are critical in determining the therapeutic efficacy of an ADC.",

The linker between two compounds is a vital bridge. The linker of the small-molecule conjugate should be generally cleaved and restabilized within several hours because the conjugate can quickly bind to the receptor and be rapidly cleared by the kidneys. In addition, for conjugates with poor bioavailability, a hydrophilic linker can be introduced to conjugate the two compounds to regulate the polarity of the conjugate and meet the bioavailability objectives, meaning that the design of the linker needs to be very compatible. Compared with its two parental small molecules, the polarity, binding affinity, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the small-molecule conjugate may change considerably. Therefore, some functional groups can be introduced or conjugated to two chemistry-modified parental derivatives to enhance the binding affinity of the conjugate and reduce any off-target effect.",

ADCs are formed by an antibody against a specific tumor-associated antigen (TAA), a cytotoxic payload, and a chemical linker that binds both. To this regard, most efforts have been focused on target identification, antibody design and linker optimization, but other relevant aspects for clinical development have not received the necessary attention. In this article using data from approved ADCs, we evaluated all characteristics of these agents, including payload physicochemical properties, in vitro potency, drug antibody ratio (DAR), exposure\u2013response relationships, and clinical development strategies. We suggest that compounds with best options for clinical development include those with optimal payload physicochemical properties and cleavable linkers that would lead to a bystander effect. These modalities can facilitate the development of ADCs in indications with low expression of the TAA. Early clinical development strategies including changes in the schedule of administration with more frequent doses are also discussed in the context of an efficient strategy. In conclusion, we highlight relevant aspects that are needed for the optimal development of ADCs in cancer, proposing options for improvement.",

This concept had been tested for the soluble expression of Fab fragments [11,[18][19][20], however, we added the capability to remove the linker by taking advantage of the papain cleaving site in the hinge region of the heavy chain and by adding a thrombin cleaving site at the amino-terminal end of the light chain. In addition, a cleavable polyhistidine tag was added to the amino-terminal end of the heavy chain to allow on-column refolding [21] among other refolding methods. This single chain strategy was tested on four Fab fragments: adalimumab-Fab (Humira1), NISTmAb-Fab (RM 8671), rituximab-Fab (Rituxan1), and trastuzumab-Fab (Herceptin1). The use of thrombin to remove the tag and linker at the amino-terminal ends would leave only serine-glycine dipeptides that would induce negligible differences on NMR spectra of the final fragment compared to the Fab obtained from the papain cleavage of corresponding commercial drugs.",

            "text": "In summary, we have developed a general approach to the synthesis of oligonucleotide-MMAE conjugates of various stoichiometries with an enzymatically cleavable linker. The method is based on a two-step click approach. In the first step, alkyne-modified oligonucleotides are readily converted to azido derivatives via a click reaction with di-or tetraazide in solution. The resulting azido-modified oligonucleotides/aptamers are then reacted with an alkyne-modified MMAE derivative containing an enzyme-cleavable linker. Branched and linear conjugates of the EGFR-targeting aptamer GR20 and a model unstructured oligonucleotide were synthesized and tested on various cancer cell lines. The general modular approach is potentially applicable to the assembly of conjugates of any oligonucleotide sequences, payloads, and cleavable linkers with a desired stoichiometry. The payload is introduced into the modification step as an alkyne-modified cleavable linker-based derivative. Almost all common enzymatically cleavable linkers and toxic payloads tolerate CuAAC conditions, thus making the approach versatile and suitable for the full range of available linkers and payloads, including potential new ones [78]. Moreover, this modular principle can be further developed in the future for the construction of conjugates carrying two different payloads or peptides to enhance transport across the BBB. \n\nWe found that the branched aptamer conjugates were more potent than their 1:1 analog. The combination of two payloads in one conjugate with different cellular targets is considered as a promising approach to overcome tumor resistance to therapy [30,78,79]. The development of peptides/proteins targeting the transferrin receptor is a hot topic for drug delivery to the brain [80][81][82]. Therefore, we will continue to develop synthetic approaches for conjugates containing recognizing, transport-enhancing, and therapeutic moieties.",

            "text": "Simple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.",

            "text": "The free secondary amines on the piperazine group can bind to the antibody as the conjugation point of the linker. Phenyl piperazine substitution at R3 and substitution of R1 and R2 to F and H, respectively, resulted in a slightly improved analog 110 that was effective against C-Kit and HER2-expressing cell lines at nmol/L concentration. The anti-C-Kit conjugates obtained using noncleavable linkers with payloads 110 not only have low aggregation, but also have optimal anti-CKIT activity (IC 50 is 9 and 40 pmol/L, respectively), and are shown to be targeted in the GIST-T1 xenograft model of c-Kit-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The payload for ADCs needs to contain active heteroatoms to bind the cleavable linker, while FK-866 lacks an amino, hydroxy, or mercapto functional group. To obtain a payload that can be easily integrated and retain potency, Peter D. Senter 133 prepared a series of FK-866 analogs with aniline substitution at different locations on the aromatic tail. The compounds were further evaluated for cytotoxicity against L540cy, A549, and HepG2 cell lines. Compound 111 displayed similar potency to FK-866 in both assays. The crystals of NAMPT and compound 111 showed that the newly incorporated aniline group interacts with the backbone amide of Glu376 via a hydrogen bond, potentially offsetting any desolvation penalty for the addition of a polar functional group. Compound 112 prepared with a potent inhibitor chs-828 found in the pyridyl cyanoguanidine group and compound 113 prepared with pyridyl square amide groups retain a strong binding to NAMPT and have strong cytotoxicity. These compounds have been advanced into the evaluation as ADC drug payloads. At well-tolerated doses, significant levels of activity were shown in several tumor models. Recent advances in payloads proteasome at low nanomolar concentrations, effective against many cancer cell lines (Fig. 20). However, due to their poor selectivity, they often exhibit toxic side effects.",

The latter conditions were also corroborated at higher antibody scale (300 mg of trastuzumab) and by application to various other antibodies, including brentuximab, rituximab, B12, and enfortumab (see Supplementary Figures S15-S16 and Table S8). In addition, we found that GalNAcT could be applied concomitantly with endo SH without compromising overall remodeling efficiency under mild conditions (histidine buffer, pH 7.5, 30\u00b0C), thereby avoiding one unit operation, which is clearly undesirable from a manufacturing perspective. \n\nWith suitable protocols established for enzymatic remodeling and generation of ADCs with payloads maytansinoid (4) or MMAE (5), a range of BCN-linker-constructs was synthesized and conjugated (Table 2 and Supplementary Figures S17-S23 and S27-S32) based on other cytotoxic molecules common in the field of ADCs, including calicheamicin variants (14 and 15), a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer ( 16), PNU-159,682 (17)  and duocarmycin (18). In each case, conjugations were performed on trastuzumab remodeled with 6-azidoGalNAc (trast-3) and monovalent BCN-linker-drugs (y = 1) were used to generate DAR2 ADCs (entry 1-5). Two branched BCN-linker constructs (y = 2) were also applied, one based on MMAE (5)  and one based on maytansinoid payload (19, see Figure 6), each of which was successfully conjugated to trast-3 to obtain DAR4 ADCs (entries 6 and 7).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a powerful class of anticancer therapeutic agents that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. ADCs have been used in many patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To date, twelve ADCs have received FDA approval, with numerous others in different clinical research stages [101,102]. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (payloads) that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linkers have a key role in ADC outcomes because their characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and noncleavable, and both have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Cleavable linkers have been used in many ADCs, such as hydrazone linkers in gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting CD33 for patients with AML, dipeptide (VC) MMAE linkers in brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) targeting CD30 for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and SMCC linkers in trastuzumab emtansine targeting HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancers [101,102].\n\nThe cytotoxic drugs used as payloads are highly potent agents used to kill cancer cells. The microtubule inhibitors auristatins and maytansinoids are the drugs most frequently used for ADC development, in addition to the DNA synthesis inhibitors calicheamicin, doxorubicin and duocarmycins [101,103].\n\nAs the most important component of ADCs, the antibody can specifically identify and bind to a well-characterized tumor antigen receptor and deliver the payload to the tumor cell in the process. Currently, Nectin4, CD79b, CD22, CD33, HER2, CD30, FOLR1, and TROP2 are the antigens most often targeted by ADCs. In addition, over 70 other antigens are in different stages of clinical development [101,[103][104][105][106].",

            "text": "An essential structural component of an AAC is the engineering of a linker responsible for the connection between cargo and payload, such as an antibiotic and antibody. On the one hand, the linker must be stable in blood circulation to keep the antibiotic attached to the antibody (Chau et al., 2019). Premature release of antibiotics in circulation can decrease AAC efficiency and increased AAC toxicity (Donaghy, 2016;Buecheler et al., 2018). On the other hand, it must retain the ability to release the payload once the antibody is internalized. Another property to be considered is the linker hydrophobicity (Su and Zhang, 2021). The connection of a hydrophobic linker and a hydrophobic payload might promote aggregation, which compromises the AAC stability. Different strategies have been widely applied to improve their physicochemical properties due to its usefulness. Currently, there are two major classes: cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers (Tsuchikama and An, 2018). \n\nMost ADCs in clinical trials or in preclinical studies are composed of cleavable linkers. These linkers include motifs that are sensitive to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the drug from the antibioticcarrier (Dan et al., 2018). This system allows researchers to estimate the potency of unconjugated payload based on known Hydrazone linker is acid-cleavable, which allows the conjugate to remain stable in the circulation at the neutral pH (Tsuchikama and An, 2018). Nevertheless, it releases free drug through hydrolysis in the acidic cellular compartment, in either the acidic endosomes (pH 5.0-6.0) or the lysosomes (pH about 4.8). So far, the ADCs engineered with these linkers have been associated with the non-specific release of the drug in clinical trials since hydrazone linker undergo slow hydrolysis under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 \u2022 C). Another important linker, which is used in the AAC under clinical evaluation, is the cathepsin B-responsive linker (Lehar et al., 2015).",

            "text": "In addition to the linker, the conjugation site can also have a significant influence on the stability of an ADC during circulation, and hence, its overall pharmacological activity. The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemospecificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation site-dependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played a role, though likely to a much lesser extent. Bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been used to assess how the stability of the antibody-drug linker is influenced by the site of the conjugation. In a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53].",

            "text": "Although three new ADCs have been recently granted approval for the treatment of solid cancers, a major limit to ADC clinical success is resistance to these drugs. Nonetheless, ADC modular structure and the biochemical improvements will allow soon the development of new agents capable of overcoming resistance. Indeed, ADCs engineering has recently introduced new payloads, linkers and the development of a novel generation of ADCs with an increased drugto-antibody ratio (DAR) and solid bystander effects [103]. The use of novel cleavable linkers in association with membrane-permeable payload can improve the efficacy of the bystander effect, enabling ADCs to be active against targetnegative cells, namely expanding ADC efficacy to cancer with low target expression or on heterogeneous tumours [36,104]. Another strategy that can be used is the increase of linker hydrophilicity, which can impair drug resistance as P-gp/MDR1 binds to hydrophobic compounds more efficiently than hydrophilic compounds [105]. Other studies have attempted to improve the stability of ADCs in plasma by altering the composition of linkers, focusing on replacing the most susceptible to degradation linker components with more stable substitutes [106].\n\nAdditional strategies have recently been investigated to expand the group of patients who might benefit from the newer generation of ADCs. Noticeably, new potential targets including proteins expressed by cancer stem cells (CSC), such as PTK7, ephrin-A4, 5T4 and in the TME, such as CD205, CD25, B7-H3, are under investigation with some of these that already reached clinical phases of drug development [107,108]. Bispecific and biparatopic antibodies are also under investigation in preclinical studies. While bispecific antibodies can recognize two different antigens on the same antigen, biparatopic antibodies bind two nonoverlapping epitopes of the same antigen. Additionally, a newer thread of research is focusing on smarter vehicles for payloads [109]. Probody drug conjugates are a novel group of ADC prodrugs that can be activated following proteolytic cleavage by TME proteases to minimise on-target/offtumour toxicity [110]",

Bl-B01D1 (Sichuan Baili Pharmaceutical/Systimmune-) is an example of tetravalent bsADc containing a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor targeting eGFR and HeR3 antigens with a cleavable linker (DAR8) which is currently in phase i and demonstrated encouraging efficacy as well as tolerability in heavily pre-treated metastatic or locally advanced solid tumours, especially in patients with eGFR mutant NSclc (Zhang, Ma et al. 2023). \n\nthe construction of a bispecific antibody introduces mutations into conserved domains of human immunoglobulin genes that enable the assembly of asymmetric antibodies. these digressions can lead to higher immunogenic potential and the development of immunogenicity and anti-drug antibodies that impact their pharmacokinetics (clearance) and therapeutic efficacy (Staton et al. 2019;cohen et al. 2021). Furthermore, bsADcs are also subject to the design constraints of ADcs described above. Site of conjugation, stability of the payloads, linker chemistry, and hydrophobicity profiles all impact the in vivo properties of these molecules. Beyond this, bsADcs must consider several different bispecific modalities including monovalent and bivalent bispecific formats that impact tumour avidity and residence time at antigen bearing cells.",

ADCs have been used in many patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To date, twelve ADCs have received FDA approval, with numerous others in different clinical research stages [101,102]. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (payloads) that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linkers have a key role in ADC outcomes because their characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and noncleavable, and both have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Cleavable linkers have been used in many ADCs, such as hydrazone linkers in gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting CD33 for patients with AML, dipeptide (VC) MMAE linkers in brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) targeting CD30 for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and SMCC linkers in trastuzumab emtansine targeting HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancers [101,102]. \n\nThe cytotoxic drugs used as payloads are highly potent agents used to kill cancer cells. The microtubule inhibitors auristatins and maytansinoids are the drugs most frequently used for ADC development, in addition to the DNA synthesis inhibitors calicheamicin, doxorubicin and duocarmycins [101,103]. \n\nAs the most important component of ADCs, the antibody can specifically identify and bind to a well-characterized tumor antigen receptor and deliver the payload to the tumor cell in the process. Currently, Nectin4, CD79b, CD22, CD33, HER2, CD30, FOLR1, and TROP2 are the antigens most often targeted by ADCs.",

This approach simultaneously reduces drug toxicity and increases efficacy, with a powerful combination of efficient killing and precise targeting. Antibody\u2012drug conjugates (ADCs) are the best-known type of drug conjugate, combining the specificity of antibodies with the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs to reduce adverse reactions by preferentially targeting the payload to the tumor. The structure of ADCs has also provided inspiration for the development of additional drug conjugates. In recent years, drug conjugates such as ADCs, peptide\u2012drug conjugates (PDCs) and radionuclide drug conjugates (RDCs) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The scope and application of drug conjugates have been expanding, including combination therapy and precise drug delivery, and a variety of new conjugation technology concepts have emerged. Additionally, new conjugation technology-based drugs have been developed in industry. In addition to chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, drug conjugate therapy has undergone continuous development and made significant progress in treating lung cancer in recent years, offering a promising strategy for the treatment of this disease. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the use of drug conjugates for lung cancer treatment, including structure-based drug design, mechanisms of action, clinical trials, and side effects.

In another example, Ha and coworkers combined the chemo-drug combretastatin A-4 (CA4) with a tumor-targeting biotin portion and a PS Zn (II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc), in which a ROS-sensitive aminoacrylate linker was introduced for the controlled release of CA4 during PDT [125]. Besides ROSresponsive linkers, Um and co-workers used caspase 3 cleavable peptide (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp, DEVD) as a linker for the conjugation of Ce6 (PS) and MMAE (anti-cancer drug) and developed the Ce6-DEVD-MMAE nanoparticles. Compared with traditional PDT using high-energy irradiation, the new therapeutic strategy used lower-energy irradiation to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. Along with MMAE-mediated anticancer activity, strong cytotoxic effects could be induced upon exposure to lower-energy irradiation. More importantly, Ce6-DEVD-MMAE nanoparticles did not display any toxicity in the absence of light illumination due to the drug conjugation strategy, which was different from free MMAE (1-10 nM) which had obvious cytotoxicity (Figure 5D,E) [126]. \n\nAdditionally, recombinant antibody fragments have also been conjugated with PSs to realize antibody-directed PDT, of which the structure is similar to ADCs. These antibody-PS conjugates present promising strengths in superior drug loading, more favorable pharmacokinetics, enhanced potency and target cell selectivity [123].

The most familiar connectives are the following two: cleavable linker and uncleanable linker. Cleavable Linker is sensitive to the intracellular environment, where it releases free effector molecules and antibodies through catabolism and dissociation in the cell. They are generally stable in the blood, but speedy lysate in low pH and protease-rich lysosomal environments and release effector molecules. In addition, if effector molecules can cross membranes, tumors can be eliminated through the potential bystander effect. An uncleanable linker is a novel developed linker with superior plasma stabilization than a cleavable linker. Owing to uncleanable linkers offer superior stability and safety than cleavable linkers, and these linkers depress off-target toxicity and offer a broader therapeutic scope. As is well known, the linker to realize the efficient release of cytotoxic drugs in tumor cells by precise release of toxic small molecules into cancer cells to kill tumor cells. At the same time, it will keep stable in the blood circulation and in tissues outside the target tissue to avoid the adverse reactions caused by the release of toxic small molecules. The coupling way directly determines the drug antibody ratio, the distribution of conjugation sites, and the stability of conjugation.",

            "text": "Strategies that allow the selective release of a payload in its native form from a larger construct have found utility in many areas of chemical and biological science, such as in prodrugs and chemical probes, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), [10][11][12][13][14][15][16] materials science [17][18][19][20][21] and solid supported chemical synthesis. [22]  major family of selective release linkers are the selfimmolative or 'traceless' linker systems that allow the fragmentation of a construct upon a specific trigger event, releasing the molecule(s) of interest (Scheme 1). [23,24] Ideally, this allows for an initial masking of certain properties of the molecule while included in the construct, after which these properties are restored upon a controlled release. These approaches also enable existing molecules of interest to be used in novel constructs, expediting research programs and allowing their exploitation. \n\nMany self-immolative linker systems utilise free amine, [25][26][27] hydroxy, [9,12,15,16] or thiol [14] groups on the payload as the linkage point due to their prevalence, ease of synthetic manipulation, and the multitude of different release methodologies described. [24] Indeed, these three key functional handles are found in all FDA-approved ADCs with cleavable linkers. [10] owever, evidently not all molecules possess amines, alcohols, and thiols, and whilst often these groups can be incorporated into the structure, this inherently affects the properties and function of the released molecule and so any changes must be carefully planned. The ability to release a molecule of interest in its native form using other functional groups, therefore, is highly attractive. \n\nAmides are a ubiquitous functional group yet methods for their use as self-immolative linker handles have been seldom reported. This concept article discusses methods developed to release amide-containing molecules, highlighting their synthesis, release mechanism, and utility.",

            "text": "2.1. Linker Design. Compatibility of polymerase-nucleotide conjugates with microelectrode arrays hinges foremost on the linker moiety, which contains differentiable chemical functionality allowing cleavage in the presence of the growing oligonucleotide. We therefore set out to identify electrochemically cleavable functionality which could be incorporated with minimal disruption to the other roles of the linker. \u221228 However, evaluation of model systems containing these functionalities by cyclic voltammetry indicated that electrochemical reduction was unlikely to proceed within the typical electrochemical window of aqueous buffers for either of these functionalities (Figure S1). With the existing enzyme-nucleotide conjugate incompatible with parallelization on microelectrode arrays, we elected to generate a novel conjugate by altering the linker. \n\nA literature review of linker structures with known biological compatibility produced several potentially electrochemically cleavable options (Table S1). Among the identified linkers, we initially considered those cleavable under acidic conditions, as the acid-catalyzed removal of dimethoxytrityl protecting groups for spatially controlled phosphoramidite synthesis has been previously implemented on microelectrode arrays. 5,18,29 e were concerned by the potential for acid-catalyzed depurination of the growing oligonucleotide under the strongly acidic conditions likely to be necessary for rapid linker cleavage, however, and thus did not pursue this path. 30,31 Also potentially attractive were linkers cleavable under basic conditions. Unfortunately, we found that the voltage necessary to affect basicity by reduction of water were incompatible with our microelectrode arrays (Figure S2a). \n\nHaving examined and ruled out an acid/base-catalyzed cleavage mechanism, we turned our attention to redox cleavable linkers and took inspiration from 1, a linker developed by van der Veken et al. for peptide conjugation in phosphoproteomics studies (Figure 2a). 32",

            "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) offer a means to specifically target cytotoxic compounds to tumors and are a promising modality for cancer therapy. Recent technological improvements addressing the limitations of the first generation of ADCs are due to a renewed interest in this class of molecules [1]. These improvements include new classes of potent cytotoxic drugs, improved linker stability, and the advancement of antibodies and conjugation methods [1,2]. These innovations in ADC technology provide a widened therapeutic index through improved potency, stability, and safety. Site-specific conjugation approaches are of particular interest since they enable homogeneous conjugates, which leads to molecules with greatly improved biophysical and pharmacokinetic profiles compared to heterogeneous conjugates produced by conventional random conjugation methods [3,4]. \n\nOne of the most promising technologies for producing homogenous, site-specific ADCs is the incorporation of non-natural amino acids (nnAAs) into the IgG [5,6]. These novel amino acids can then provide an orthogonal chemical functional group, such as an aldehyde or azide, to which a drug-linker can be attached via click chemistry [5]. Unlike enzymatic conjugation methods, which have sequence motif or conjugation site requirements, nnAAs offer improved flexibility since they are encoded at the genetic level and can be inserted at almost any location in the protein with minimal perturbation to the surrounding sequence [3,7]. This method allows for fine tuning of the ADC conjugation sites, enabling the selection of the molecule with the desired efficacy, stability, and safety profiles. \n\nCell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems are uniquely suited for the production of nnAAs containing IgGs since they can be engineered to support high-fidelity amber suppression at multiple sites in a single poly-peptide chain, while their open nature allows for the establishment of an oxidizing environment suitable for IgG production and assembly [8]. Synthesis of nnAAs containing IgGs in mammalian systems is well established; however, amber suppression efficiency is limited by competition with the release factor (RF) responsible for translation termination at the TAG amber stop codon [9,10].",

            "text": "Since the 1970s, there have been innumerable approaches to ADC synthesis and development, for both solid and hematological tumors. Multiple types of drug-conjugates were proposed, such as bispecific ADCs, bi-epitope ADCs, fab-fragment of the antibody (FabDCs), single-chain antibody fragment drug conjugates, nanobody drug conjugates, peptide drug conjugates, radioimmune conjugates, bispecific monoclonal antibodies (mAb), dual payloads, nanoparticles, and others [9]. \n\nModern ADCs typically consist of three main components: an antibody, a linker, and a payload (Figure 1). Most ADCs undergo similar mechanisms to release the payload. In general, after intravenous (IV) administration and tissue distribution, ADCs bind target antigens with the antibody moiety and undergo internalization/endocytosis. In the endosomes (if cleavable), the payload is released via protease (such as cathepsin B) cleavage of the linker or by the degradation of the ADC. The activated payload diffuses to cytosol and the nucleus, binds to microtubules or DNA, and triggers cell death (Figure 2). If lipophilic, the activated payload can diffuse into the microenvironment and kill neighbor cells (bystander effect) [10]. \n\nDepending on linker technology, different proportions of the payload may be systemically released, contributing to systemic toxicity, or acting as traditional chemotherapy. In some cases, the systemic payload release was so significant that concerns were raised if there was any ADC attributed activity at all [11]. Some of these concerns are also based on studies suggesting that less than 1% of the administered ADC reaches the target tumor site [12]. Radiolabeled antibody studies showed that only 0.01% of the injected antibody could be localized in a solid tumor mass 24 h after infusion, irrespective of tumor type or antibody target [13]. The immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody molecular mass is 146 kDa [14].",

            "text": "ADCs are a novel class for cancer treatments that aid the delivery of highly potent cytotoxic anticancer drugs to be released at the therapeutic target [78]. They are composed of three main components, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), linker, and the payload [78]. \n\nMonoclonal antibodies have been proven to play a central role in cancer therapy. They are produced either by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary) or murine hybridoma technology. The selection of the linker to anchor the payload to the mAb is of utmost importance. It is imperative for the linker to be stable in the blood stream and be able to undergo a programmed metabolism to release the payload at the therapeutic target [79,80]. A valine-citrulline (Val-Cit)-cleavable linker is an optimal choice for this purpose. In contrast to other tetrapeptidyl linkers like GFLF and ALAL, Val-Cit has not exhibited any aggregation problems during the conjugation process [79][80][81]. It is worth highlighting that other known linkers do not fulfil the aforementioned prerequisite for an ideal linker. For example, hydrazone-based linkers have demonstrated premature payload release, attributed to instability at different pH values, while disulfide-based linkers have exhibited susceptibility to exchanging with other thiols. Two maleimide-based non-cleavable linkers, namely (i) maleimidocaproyl and (ii) maleimidomethyl cyclohexane1-carboxylate, are commonly utilized. However, despite their widespread use, this linker is susceptible to a retro-Michael reaction, leading to the premature detachment of the drug linker from the ADC [82]. Furthermore, the succinimidyl thioether moiety undergoes irreversible hydrolysis, a reaction that frequently takes place in ADCs, often at rates that surpass their intended in vivo lifetime [83][84][85]. Various strategies are employed to address these issues.",

DM1 was coupled to the lysine residue of trastuzumab via a non-cleavable linker, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) [21]. Since the linker was non-cleavable, T-DM1 could turn to an active state only by digestion in the lysosome after internalization. T-DM1 was an effective drug for HER2-positive breast cancer; hence, it was approved by the FDA in 2013 [22]. Linker improvements in second-generation ADCs achieved better plasma stability and harmonized DAR distribution. The cytotoxicity and coupling of payloads in second-generation ADCs were also improved, and the increase of payloads' water solubility reduced the occurrence of antibody aggregation. \n\nIn addition, some of the second-generation ADCs utilized cleavable linkers, such as Adcetris and Polivy for lymphoma treatment [23,24]. These ADCs with cleavable linkers can cause a bystander effect in vivo, referring to the phenomenon that payloads can be released and kill surrounding cells. Despite the considerable safety advances of secondgeneration ADCs, the shadow therapeutic window due to off-target toxicity is still a challenge for ADCs [25].",

This, in turn, significantly influences therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should avoid inducing ADC aggregation, prevent premature payload release in the bloodstream, and facilitate the release of active drugs precisely at the desired target. Linkers are broadly classified into two main types based on cellular metabolism processes [10][11][12][13]: cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

            "text": "Targeted drug delivery strategies combine a targeting agent and a payload molecule through a cleavable linker. [1,2] [5] The success of an ADC depends on the careful selection of appropriate payloads, optimization of antibody characteristics, and the use of linkers that cleave only after target engagement. [6,7] 10] An appealing strategy is to engineer the linker domain to improve the overall physical properties of the ADC. \n\nExisting linkers often rely on the self-immolative paraamino benzyl (PAB) spacer unit, which was first introduced for biological applications by Katzenellenbogen in 1981. [11] ased on an efficient and general 1,6-elimination (Figure 1A), this approach has been widely used to create cleavable linkers that respond to various stimuli. [12] 20][21][22][23] A critical insight to emerge from these studies is that charged, but net neutral (i.e. zwitterionic) functional groups can effectively shield the hydrophobicity of the payload and improve in vivo targeting performance. We hypothesize that suitable chemistry could introduce otherwise hydrophobic payloads onto targeting mAbs without compromising the properties of the parent antibody. While several efforts have looked at pegylation strategies, [9,[24][25][26][27] no approaches that incorporate zwitterionic linker domains have been developed. \n\nHerein, we detail a cleavable zwitterionic linker strategy utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads. [28,29] [32] In this work, we fuse these two fundamental chemistries such that upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination unveils a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2elimination to release the payload (Figure 1B). \n\nA feature of the BAC strategy is that the cleavage site is independent from the conjugation chemistry.",

The resulting complex, which consists of an amino acid, a linker, and a cytotoxic agent, is regarded as an active medication. On the other hand, cleavable linkers are dissociated by cancer cell enzymes. The cytotoxic payload can then leave the targeted cell and destroy nearby cells through a process known as \"bystander killing\" [120]. \n\nAOCs, or antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, comprise two essential classes of macromolecules: monoclonal antibodies and oligonucleotides. With AOC, various applications, such as imaging, detection, and targeted therapeutics, have profited from the union of the diverse functional modes of oligonucleotides with the potent targeting properties of monoclonal antibodies. The fundamental obstacles to effective ON therapies are cell internalization and absorption. ADCs can be used to get around problems with Chemical motif-defined linkers include disulfides, hydrazones, peptides (cleavable), or thioethers (non-cleavable). Cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have proven safe in preclinical and clinical trials. The anti-microtubule agent monomethyl auristatin E, or MMAE, a synthetic antineoplastic agent, is delivered to human-specific CD30-positive malignant cells by the enzyme-sensitive cleavable linker in the drug compound brentuximab vedotin. By preventing the polymerization of tubulin, MMAE prevents cell division. MMAE cannot be utilized as a single-agent chemotherapeutic medication due to its severe toxicity. However, the stability of MMAE attached to an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is unaffected by extracellular fluid.

Here, we report that glutamic acid-glycine-citrulline (EGCit) linkers have the potential to solve this clinical issue without compromising the ability of traceless drug release and ADC therapeutic efficacy. We demonstrate that our EGCit ADC resists neutrophil protease-mediated degradation and spares differentiating human neutrophils. Notably, our anti-HER2 ADC show almost no sign of blood and liver toxicity in healthy mice at 80 mg kg-1. In contrast, at the same dose level, the FDA-approved anti-HER2 ADCs Kadcyla\u00ae and Enhertu\u00ae show increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase and morphological changes in liver tissues. Our EGCit conjugates also exert greater antitumor efficacy in multiple xenograft tumor models compared to Kadcyla\u00ae and Enhertu\u00ae. This linker technology could substantially broaden the therapeutic windows of ADCs and other drug delivery agents, providing clinical options with improved efficacy and safety.",

The precise design of these linker-camptothecins has been instrumental in achieving optimal safety and efficacy for specific therapeutic indications. Growing evidence suggests that a single linker-payload design cannot accommodate the diverse requirements of various therapeutic targets. For instance, while the linker-payload of Enhertu (GGFG-DXd) has shown exceptional efficacy in HER2-targeted therapies, its performance is less promising in TROP2- and HER3-targeted indications. This highlights the critical need for linker-camptothecin systems with greater diversity in drug release mechanisms, kinetics, and payload potency to address varying therapeutic needs. To address the limitations of existing linker-camptothecin designs, including issues with stability, release efficiency, and specificity, we have developed a comprehensive library of linker-camptothecins with enhanced molecular diversity.

This molecular diversity facilitates optimized release profiles and payload activities, tailored to specific therapeutic scenarios.

They possess the potential to not only address disease intricacy but also exploit new therapeutic mechanisms and assess undruggable targets for conventional monospecific biologics. This review focuses on the recent advances in molecular design and applications of major classes of multispecific biotherapeutics drugs, which include immune cells engagers, antibody-drug conjugates, multispecific tetherbodies, biologic matchmakers, and small-scaffold multispecific modalities.

Peptides as tumor-targeting carriers in peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) offer a number of benefits. Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) is a highly lipophilic PDC that takes a novel approach by utilizing increased aminopeptidase activity to selectively increase the release and concentration of cytotoxic alkylating agents inside tumor cells. The only other PDC approved currently for clinical use is 177Lu-dotatate, a targeted form of radiotherapy combining a somatostatin analog with a radionuclide. It is approved as a treatment for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Results with other PDCs combining synthetic analogs of natural peptide ligands with cytotoxic agents have been mixed. The field of drug conjugates as drug delivery systems for the treatment of cancer continues to advance with the application of new technologies.

The immunogenicity of biotherapeutics is, therefore, an important issue. There is evidence that protein aggregation can result in enhanced immunogenicity; however, the precise immunological and biochemical mechanisms responsible are poorly defined. In the context of biotherapeutic drug development and safety assessment, understanding the mechanisms underlying aggregate immunogenicity is of considerable interest. This review provides an overview of the phenomenon of protein aggregation, the production of unwanted aggregates during bioprocessing, and how the immune response to aggregated protein differs from that provoked by non-aggregated protein. Of particular interest is the nature of the interaction of aggregates with the immune system and how subsequent ADA responses are induced. Pathways considered here include \u2018classical\u2019 activation of the immune system involving antigen presenting cells and, alternatively, the breakdown of B-cell tolerance. Additionally, methods available to screen for aggregation and immunogenicity will be described. With an increased understanding of aggregation-enhanced immune responses, it may be possible to develop improved manufacturing and screening processes to avoid, or at least reduce, the problems associated with ADA.",

These descriptors were used to identify three nontoxic surrogate payloads that encompass the range of hydrophobicity defined by the ADC toxin training set. The uniform drug to antibody ratio (DAR) ADCs were prepared for each surrogate payload by conjugation to the interchain cysteine residues of a model IgG1 subtype mAb. Linkage of these surrogate payloads to a common mAb with a matched DAR value allowed for preliminary analytical interrogation of the influence of payload hydrophobicity on global structure, self-association, and aggregation properties. The results of differential scanning fluorimetry and dynamic light scattering experiments clearly revealed a direct correlation between the destabilization of the native mAb structure and the increasing payload hydrophobicity. Also, self-association/aggregation propensity examined by self-interaction biolayer interferometry or size exclusion HPLC was consistent with increased conversion of the monomeric mAb to higher order aggregated species, with the degree of conversion directly proportional to the payload hydrophobicity. In summary, these findings prove that the payload-dependent structure destabilization and enhanced propensity to self-associate/aggregate driven by the increasing payload hydrophobicity contribute to reduced ADC stability and more complex behavior when assessing exposure and safety/efficacy relationships."

In the early 1980s, the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolate linker chemistry was developed by Carl et al. for use in prodrug design (Carl et al., 1981). Since then, the PABC linker type has been extensively utilized in ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADC. Upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes after ADC internalization into the target cells, the PABC spacer in the vc-PAB-MMAE linker/payload goes through a cascade of disassembly reactions and facilitates the release of untethered MMAE intracellularly [197]. The vc-PABC linker exhibits superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profile compared to the earlier cleavable linker generations, such as the pH-sensitive hydrazone linker used in calicheamicin-based ADCs or disulfide reducible linker used in DM1-based ADCs (Polakis, 2016)...Recently, Pillow et al. have developed sophisticated self-immolative spacer chemistry that enabled direct conjugation of a cytotoxic payload to engineered cysteine residues (Pillow et al., 2016). This spacer facilitates a stable disulfide bridge, leading to enhanced plasma PK while allowing a rapid traceless release of free payloads intracellularly. This technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to the conventional peptide-PABC linker technology (Pillow et al., 2017). In this study, both the conventional peptide-ADC and the self-immolative disulfide-ADC displayed similar in vivo potency.",

                "snippets": "The development of ADCs has advanced substantially in the past decade, driven by improvements in payloads, linkers, and coupling techniques (Markham, 2020)(Su et al., 2021). Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms (Ducry, 2013). Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156].",

The best method to maximize safety and efficacy is to deliver a proven therapeutic agent with a targeting ligand that exhibits little affinity for healthy cells but high affinity for pathologic cells. The probability of regulatory approval can conceivably be further enhanced by exploiting the same targeting ligand, conjugated to an imaging agent, to select patients whose diseased tissues display sufficient targeted receptors for therapeutic efficacy. The focus of this Review is to summarize criteria that must be met during design of ligand-targeted drugs (LTDs) to achieve the required therapeutic potency with minimal toxicity. Because most LTDs are composed of a targeting ligand (e.g., organic molecule, aptamer, protein scaffold, or antibody), spacer, cleavable linker, and therapeutic warhead, criteria for successful design of each component will be described. Moreover, because obstacles to successful drug design can differ among human pathologies, limitations to drug delivery imposed by the unique characteristics of different diseases will be considered. With the explosion of genomic and transcriptomic data providing an ever-expanding selection of disease-specific targets, and with tools for high-throughput chemistry offering an escalating diversity of warheads, opportunities for innovating safe and effective LTDs has never been greater."

Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms (Ducry, 2013). Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156]."

The hydrophilic nature of linker plays a pivotal role in diminishing nonspecific uptake or off-target toxicity of payload. SMCC linkers incorporate a cyclo-nucleic acid ring that reduces the antibody conjugate's hydrolysis rate at high pH levels, thus bolstering stability while preserving antibody specificity. On the other hand, MD linkers substitute the cyclo-nucleic acid ring of SMCC linkers with 1,3-dioxolein, enhancing linker hydrophilicity and stability due to the presence of two oxygen atoms within the 1,3-dioxolein ring (Figure 4)...proved Hodgkin's lymphoma drug brentuximab vedotin using an CD30 antibody with a peptide cleavable linker and MMAE (Moskowitz et al., 2015). Furthermore, various enzyme-based linkers, such as \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b2-galactosidase linkers, have been developed (Bargh et al., 2020)(Jackson et al., 2022)(Bargh et al., 2021)(Rivas et al., 2019) (Figure 4).

These two components are joined by a covalent linker, whose nature is critical to the efficacy and safety of the ADC. Enzyme-cleavable dipeptidic linkers have emerged as a particularly effective ADC linker type due to their ability to selectively release the payload in the lysosomes of target cells. However, these linkers have a number of drawbacks, including instability in rodent plasma and their inherently high hydrophobicity. Here we show that arylsulfate-containing ADC linkers are cleaved by lysosomal sulfatase enzymes to tracelessly release their payload, while circumventing the instability problems associated with dipeptide-linkers. When incorporated with trastuzumab and the highly potent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, the arylsulfate-containing ADC 2 and ADC 3 were more cytotoxic than the non-cleavable ADC 4 against HER2-positive cells, while maintaining selectivity over HER2-negative cells. We propose that the stability, solubility and synthetic tractability of our arylsulfate linkers make them an attractive new motif for cleavable ADC linkers, with clear benefits over the widely used dipeptidic linkers.",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

Methods Fluorescent or radiolabeled liposomes composed of sphingomyelin/cholesterol and containing phosphatidic acid, known to bind amyloid-\u03b2, were further functionalized with the anti-transferrin receptor antibody RI7217. Two different techniques were used to attach RI7217 to the liposomes surface: biotin/streptavidin linkage or thiol\u2013maleimide covalent ligation. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and immunoblotting were employed to assess the nanoparticles\u2019 binding performances. Confocal microscopy and radiochemical techniques were used for uptake and permeability studies on an in vitro BBB model made of human brain capillary endothelial cells hCMEC/D3. Results Immunoblotting experiments showed that RI7217-functionalized liposomes bind to transferrin receptor independently of the procedure employed to ligate their surface with the antibody, while SPR experiments showed a slightly higher affinity for covalently functionalized nanoliposomes. The functionalization with RI7217 did not affect the liposomes\u2019 affinity for amyloid-\u03b2. The functionalization of liposomes with RI7217, independently of the ligation procedure, gave higher values of uptake and permeability across the barrier model in comparison to the nondecorated ones, without cell monolayer alterations. Of note, the best performing particles were those covalently coupled with the antibody. The ratios of the two radiolabeled lipids (3H-sphingomyelin and 14C-phosphatidic acid) present in the liposome bilayer were found to be similar in the apical and in the basolateral compartments of the barrier model, suggesting that liposomes were transported intact across the cell monolayer. Confocal experiments showed no co-localization of RI7217-liposomes with early/late endosomes or early lysosomes. Conclusion Our results suggest that RI7217 promotes the in vitro barrier crossing of liposomes containing phosphatidic acid, targeting the Alzheimer\u2019s disease amyloid-\u03b2 peptide. Moreover, for the first time, we prove herein the superior efficiency of covalent coupling of RI7217 versus biotin/streptavidin ligation to facilitate liposomes in overcoming the BBB in vitro."

This action reduces the therapeutic index by causing off-target toxicities that can be dose-limiting. For example, a common side-effect of ADCs made using peptide-cleavable linkers is myelosuppression, including neutropenia. Only a few reports describe methods for optimizing peptide linkers to maintain efficient and potent tumor payload delivery while enhancing circulating stability. Herein, we address these critical limitations through the development of a tandem-cleavage linker strategy, where two sequential enzymatic cleavage events mediate payload release. We prepared dipeptides that are protected from degradation in the circulation by a sterically-encumbering glucuronide moiety. Upon ADC internalization and lysosomal degradation, the monosaccharide is removed and the exposed dipeptide is degraded, liberating the attached payload inside the target cell. We used CD79b-targeted monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugates as our model system, and compared the stability, efficacy, and tolerability of ADCs made with tandem-cleavage linkers to ADCs made using standard technology with the vedotin linker. The results\u2014where rat studies showed dramatically improved tolerability in the hematopoietic compartment\u2014highlight the role that linker stability plays in efficacy and tolerability, and offer a means of improving an ADC\u2019s therapeutic index for improved patient outcomes."

This small engineered protein was successfully cross-linked only to the Fc region of the antibody without any nonspecific reactivity. SPR analysis indicated that antibodies can be site-selectively biotinylated through the present photoactivable protein. Furthermore, the system enabled light-induced covalent immobilization of antibodies directly on various solid surfaces, such as those of glass slides, gold chips, and small particles.

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

Targeted drug delivery, especially drug conjugate, has been recognized as a technology that can bring forth a new generation of therapeutics with improved efficacy and reduced side effects for cancer treatment. The linker in a drug conjugate is of essential importance because it impacts the circulation time of the conjugate and the release of the drug for full activity at the target site. Recently, the light-triggered linker has attracted a lot of attention due to its spatiotemporal controllability and attractive prospects of improving the overall pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. In this paper, the latest developments of UV- and IR-triggered linkers and their application and potential in drug conjugate development are reviewed. Some of the most-well-researched photoresponsive structural moieties, such as UV-triggered coumarin, ortho-nitrobenzyl group (ONB), thioacetal ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde (TNB), photocaged C40-oxidized abasic site (PC4AP), and IR-triggered cyanine and BODIPY, are included for discussion. These photoremovable linkers show better physical and chemical stabilities and can undergo rapid cleavage upon irradiation. Very importantly, the drug conjugates containing these linkers exhibit reduced off-target toxicity and overall better pharmacokinetic properties.

Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints.

ADCs have made considerable progress in 10 years. While in 2009 only gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u00ae) was used clinically, in 2020, 9 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ADCs are available, and more than 80 others are in active clinical studies. This review will focus on FDA-approved and late-stage ADCs, their limitations including their toxicity and associated resistance mechanisms, as well as new emerging strategies to address these issues and attempt to widen their therapeutic window. Finally, we will discuss their combination with conventional chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors, and their design for applications beyond oncology, to make ADCs the magic bullet that Paul Ehrlich dreamed of.",

It combines both the advantages of highly specific targeting ability and highly potent killing effect to achieve accurate and efficient elimination of cancer cells, which has become one of the hotspots for the research and development of anticancer drugs. Since the first ADC, Mylotarg \u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), was approved in 2000 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there have been 14 ADCs received market approval so far worldwide. Moreover, over 100 ADC candidates have been investigated in clinical stages at present. This kind of new anti-cancer drugs, known as \u201cbiological missiles\u201d, is leading a new era of targeted cancer therapy. Herein, we conducted a review of the history and general mechanism of action of ADCs, and then briefly discussed the molecular aspects of key components of ADCs and the mechanisms by which these key factors influence the activities of ADCs. Moreover, we also reviewed the approved ADCs and other promising candidates in phase-3 clinical trials and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives for the development of next generations, which provide insights for the research and development of novel cancer therapeutics using ADCs.",

Unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drug-based therapies, that are mainly associated with modest specificity and therapeutic benefit, the three key components that form an ADC (a monoclonal antibody bound to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker moiety) achieve remarkable improvement in terms of targeted killing of cancer cells and, while sparing healthy tissues, a reduction in systemic side effects caused by off-tumor toxicity. Based on their beneficial mechanism of action, 15 ADCs have been approved to date by the market approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and/or other international governmental agencies for use in clinical oncology, and hundreds are undergoing evaluation in the preclinical and clinical phases. Here, our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the key features revolving around ADC therapeutic strategy including their structural and targeting properties, mechanism of action, the role of the tumor microenvironment and review the approved ADCs in clinical oncology, providing discussion regarding their toxicity profile, clinical manifestations and use in novel combination therapies. Finally, we briefly review ADCs in other pathological contexts and provide key information regarding ADC manufacturing and analytical characterization."

This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads.

[6,7] 10] An appealing strategy is to engineer the linker domain to improve the overall physical properties of the ADC.\n\nExisting linkers often rely on the self-immolative paraamino benzyl (PAB) spacer unit, which was first introduced for biological applications by Katzenellenbogen in 1981. [11] ased on an efficient and general 1,6-elimination (Figure 1A), this approach has been widely used to create cleavable linkers that respond to various stimuli. [12] 20][21][22][23] A critical insight to emerge from these studies is that charged, but net neutral (i.e. zwitterionic) functional groups can effectively shield the hydrophobicity of the payload and improve in vivo targeting performance.\n\nHerein, we detail a cleavable zwitterionic linker strategy utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads. [28,29] [32] In this work, we fuse these two fundamental chemistries such that upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination unveils a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2elimination to release the payload (Figure 1B).",

At the core of ADC design are linkers, which serve as the chemical bridges connecting the antibody to the payload. Cleavable linkers are specifically engineered to remain stable in circulation but undergo selective cleavage upon reaching the target tissue, thereby releasing the active drug at the desired site.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of cleavable linkers is to maintain the ADC's integrity during systemic circulation while enabling controlled drug release within or near tumor cells. This selective release mechanism aims to minimize off-target toxicity while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Cleavable linkers typically respond to specific conditions or triggers found predominantly in the tumor microenvironment or within cancer cells, such as altered pH, presence of certain enzymes, reducing conditions, or external stimuli.\n\nThe evolution of linker technology has been critical in addressing early challenges faced by first-generation ADCs, including premature drug release, limited plasma stability, and poor pharmacokinetic profiles. As understanding of tumor biology and chemical design principles has advanced, increasingly sophisticated linker systems have emerged that can navigate biological barriers and respond with greater specificity to tumor-associated conditions. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

These linkers demonstrate enhanced systemic stability due to the unsuitable pH conditions and serum protease inhibitors present in circulation, while enabling rapid enzymatic release of the payload once internalized by target cells <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA common component used in these peptide-based linker systems is para-aminobenzyl carbamate (PABC), which functions as a self-immolative spacer to facilitate the release of an unmodified payload following peptide bond cleavage <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This self-cleavage capacity is particularly important for maintaining drug potency after release.\n\npH-sensitive linkers, particularly hydrazone-containing structures, exploit the acidic environment of late endosomes and lysosomes (pH 4.5-6.0) to trigger payload release <Paper corpusId=\"271549527\" paperTitle=\"(Perez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256771727\" paperTitle=\"(Holz et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The cleavable ADC linkers can be categorized into three types: protease-sensitive linkers utilizing protease cleavable peptide sequences like cathepsin B sensitive valine-citrulline (VC) dipeptide, pH-sensitive linkers attached to acid-labile groups such as hydrazone, and glutathione-sensitive linkers containing disulfide bonds. Whereas, non-cleavable linkers, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) groups, exhibit enhanced plasma stability, and potentially improving the therapeutic index. [44]"

Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect (Fu et al., 2022)(Dumontet et al., 2023)(Tarantino et al., 2023)(Drago et al., 2021)(Beck et al., 2017)(Matsumura et al., 1986)(Matsumura, 2014)(Joubert et al., 2020)(Riccardi et al., 2023)(Jin et al., 2021). Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45]."

Linkers must be able to keep the cytotoxic payload stable in plasma, but then must also facilitate rapid and efficient release of the active drug in tumor cells. Both cleavable and noncleavable linkers have been successfully employed in approved ADCs ( Table 1). Payloads that require release of the unmodified free drug upon internalization in the tumor cell to maintain drug potency require a cleavable linker. Cleavable linker technologies most widely used are reducible disulfides, acid labile-hydrazones, and protease cleavable dipeptides (Bargh et al., 2019). Upon internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis, ADCs enter the endosomal to lysosomal pathway, where they are exposed to changing cellular conditions. The acidic environment of the late endosome promotes drug release from pH-sensitive hydrazone linkers, while disulfide linkages are cleaved by reduction due to the high concentration of glutathione present in tumor cells [10]."

Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior (Lyon et al., 2015). Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency (Lu et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes."

Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex",

Among the advantages of using a linker are preventing premature drug release, improving the liberation of the active drug at the target, and facilitating stability in the production process. The most important aspect of the linker is its physicochemical properties, which allows defining two main different kinds of linker: \n\nCleavable linker: It is characteristic of breaking one of its chemical bonds that binds the two molecular entities. This kind of linker has been successful in elaborating ADCs due to its stability in the synthesis process and the blood circulation of the conjugate for a long time. It allows the releasing of the drug under some conditions at the surrounding of the target cell or tissue-like overexpression of enzyme or acidic environment (Lu et al., 2016)Ramos Tomillero, 2016;(Kostova et al., 2021)."

In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs."

Notably, linker design plays a pivotal role in governing ADC stability in systemic circulation and payload delivery efficiency in tumors, thereby influencing pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and toxicity profiles (Su et al., 2021)(Lin et al., 2019). Key linker parameters, including coupling chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, profoundly impact ADC performance (Bargh et al., 2019). The ideal linker should maintain stability in circulation while releasing cytotoxic payloads within tumors (Srinivasarao et al., 2017). However, existing linkers often release payloads unpredictably, leading to off-target toxicity. Thus, in ADC design, precise adjustment of these linker parameters is imperative to strike a balance between stability and payload release efficiency, ensuring the desired therapeutic effect. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in optimizing ADC structures and diversifying their mechanisms (Ducry, 2013). Novel cleavable linkers, especially bioorthogonal ones, hold promise for overcoming intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs [156]."

Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies."

These novel cleavable linkers have shown increased selectivity for targeting tumors. Among them, cathepsin, glutathione, and acid-cleavable linkers have been extensively researched and incorporated into approved ADCs. Notably, phosphatase-responsive and bioorthogonal cleavable linkers have the potential to overcome intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs. Early data on these new linkers are promising and are expected to significantly advance the development of ADC drugs in the future."

One example is hydrazone linkers, which form via the reaction between a hydrazide and a carbonyl group under acidic conditions. They exhibit stability at neutral pH but undergo hydrolysis in acidic environments, facilitating linker cleavage. This mechanism has been utilized in various drug delivery systems, including liposomes and polymer conjugates [78]. Another commonly used pH-sensitive linker is the acetal linker, which remains stable at neutral pH but undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to release the payload under acidic conditions."

Once they reach the target site, such as a tumor, they can be cleaved through various mechanisms. For instance, linkers can be pH-sensitive, cleaving in the acidic environment of tumors or inflamed tissue. Alternatively, they can be enzyme-sensitive, breaking down in the presence of certain enzymes overexpressed in disease states [70,71].\n\nSelf-Immolative linker undergoes a cascade of chemical reactions triggered by a stimulus (like an enzyme or pH change), resulting in the complete breakdown of the linker and release of the drug [72].

Herein, we developed a prodrug\u2013antibody conjugate (ProADC) strategy by conjugating a bioorthogonal-activatable prodrug with an antibody that allowed on-target release and on-demand activation of cytotoxic drugs at a tumor site. The bioorthogonal-caged prodrug exhibited an enhanced permeability into and on-demand activation within cancer cells, while the pH-sensitive ADC linker allowed on-target release of the anticancer agent. Together, the ProADCs showed enhanced tumor penetration and alleviated side effects for use as an on-target and on-demand chemotherapy agents."

These advances include disulfide bridge technologies, specialized peptide sequences, thiol-responsive systems, and zwitterionic linkers that improve ADC stability while maintaining effective intracellular drug delivery. (8 sources)",
                "text": "\nSelf-immolative linkers play a crucial role in ADC technology by undergoing a cascade of chemical reactions upon initial triggering, resulting in complete linker breakdown and release of unmodified therapeutic agents <Paper corpusId=\"273979041\" paperTitle=\"(Parashar et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"2862021\" paperTitle=\"(Dosio et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. The para-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolative spacer, first developed in the early 1980s for prodrug design, has become a cornerstone of ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Following enzymatic cleavage in the lysosomal compartment, the PABC spacer in structures like vc-PAB-MMAE undergoes a 1,6-elimination reaction that facilitates the release of free, untethered payload intracellularly <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This system has demonstrated superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profiles compared to earlier cleavable linker generations such as pH-sensitive hydrazone linkers or reducible disulfide linkers <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent refinements in self-immolative chemistry include the development of specialized peptide sequences that enhance cleavage efficiency. For example, replacing the traditional Val-Ala-PABC linker with Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-PABC (GPLG-PABC) in small molecule-drug conjugates has demonstrated a four-fold improvement in anti-tumor potency across various cancer cell lines <Paper corpusId=\"259682773\" paperTitle=\"(Zambra et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This illustrates how even subtle modifications to peptide composition can significantly impact therapeutic outcomes.\n\nA major breakthrough in self-immolative linker technology came with Pillow et al.'s development of sophisticated spacer chemistry enabling direct conjugation of cytotoxic payloads to engineered cysteine residues <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15129484\" paperTitle=\"(Pillow et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach facilitates stable disulfide bridges that enhance plasma pharmacokinetics while allowing rapid traceless release of free payloads inside target cells. Notably, this technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to conventional peptide-PABC linker systems while maintaining similar in vivo potency <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe development of thiol-responsive linker systems represents another advancement in self-immolative technology. Walther et al. recently described a versatile and tunable system using thiovinylketones that relies on conjugate addition-elimination mechanisms for traceless therapeutic release <Paper corpusId=\"270450900\" paperTitle=\"(Walther et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach has demonstrated effectiveness in creating thiol-cleavable antibiotic prodrugs and antibody-drug conjugates <Paper corpusId=\"270450900\" paperTitle=\"(Walther et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, innovative cleavable zwitterionic linker strategies utilizing tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1-ammonium carbamates (BACs) have emerged <Paper corpusId=\"274858190\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This design combines two fundamental chemistries: upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination reveals a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2-elimination to release the payload <Paper corpusId=\"274858190\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, these zwitterionic functional groups effectively shield payload hydrophobicity while maintaining neutral net charge, improving in vivo targeting performance <Paper corpusId=\"274858190\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese advancements in self-immolative linker chemistry collectively demonstrate how precise engineering of the cleavage mechanism can enhance ADC stability, improve pharmacokinetics, reduce off-target effects, and ultimately increase therapeutic efficacy. The continued refinement of these technologies addresses key challenges in ADC development related to balancing systemic stability with efficient intracellular drug release.",

Alternatively, they can be enzyme-sensitive, breaking down in the presence of certain enzymes overexpressed in disease states [70,71].\n\nSelf-Immolative linker undergoes a cascade of chemical reactions triggered by a stimulus (like an enzyme or pH change), resulting in the complete breakdown of the linker and release of the drug [72].

In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs.

                            "Immunotoxins and antibody-drug conjugates are protein-based drugs combining a target-specific binding domain with a cytotoxic domain. Such compounds are potentially therapeutic against diseases including cancer, and several clinical trials have shown encouraging results. Although the targeted elimination of malignant cells is an elegant concept, there are numerous practical challenges that limit conjugates\u2019 therapeutic use, including inefficient cellular uptake, low cytotoxicity, and off-target effects. During the preparation of immunoconjugates by chemical synthesis, the choice of the hinge component joining the two building blocks is of paramount importance: the conjugate must remain stable in vivo but must afford efficient release of the toxic moiety when the target is reached. Vast efforts have been made, and the present article reviews strategies employed in developing immunoconjugates, focusing on the evolution of chemical linkers."

                            "The advancement of self-immolative linker chemistry has also improved the stability and tolerability of ADCs utilizing cleavable linkers. In the early 1980s, the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolate linker chemistry was developed by Carl et al. for use in prodrug design (Carl et al., 1981). Since then, the PABC linker type has been extensively utilized in ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADC. Upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes after ADC internalization into the target cells, the PABC spacer in the vc-PAB-MMAE linker/payload goes through a cascade of disassembly reactions and facilitates the release of untethered MMAE intracellularly [197]. The vc-PABC linker exhibits superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profile compared to the earlier cleavable linker generations, such as the pH-sensitive hydrazone linker used in calicheamicin-based ADCs or disulfide reducible linker used in DM1-based ADCs (Polakis, 2016)",
                            "Recently, Pillow et al. have developed sophisticated self-immolative spacer chemistry that enabled direct conjugation of a cytotoxic payload to engineered cysteine residues (Pillow et al., 2016). This spacer facilitates a stable disulfide bridge, leading to enhanced plasma PK while allowing a rapid traceless release of free payloads intracellularly. This technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to the conventional peptide-PABC linker technology (Pillow et al., 2017). In this study, both the conventional peptide-ADC and the self-immolative disulfide-ADC displayed similar in vivo potency."

In both strategies, a cytotoxic payload is connected to the tumor homing moiety through a linker that releases the drug inside or in proximity of the tumor cell, and that represents a key component for the final therapeutic effect of the conjugate. Here, we show that the replacement of the Val-Ala-p-aminobenzyloxycarbamate linker with the Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-p-aminobenzyloxycarbamate (GPLG-PABC) sequence as enzymatically cleavable linker in the SMDC bearing the cyclo[DKP-isoDGR] \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin ligand as tumor homing moiety and the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) as cytotoxic payload led to a 4-fold more potent anti-tumoral effect of the final conjugate on different cancer cell lines."

                            "Targeted drug delivery strategies combine a targeting agent and a payload molecule through a cleavable linker. [1,2] [5] The success of an ADC depends on the careful selection of appropriate payloads, optimization of antibody characteristics, and the use of linkers that cleave only after target engagement. [6,7] 10] An appealing strategy is to engineer the linker domain to improve the overall physical properties of the ADC.\n\nExisting linkers often rely on the self-immolative paraamino benzyl (PAB) spacer unit, which was first introduced for biological applications by Katzenellenbogen in 1981. [11] ased on an efficient and general 1,6-elimination (Figure 1A), this approach has been widely used to create cleavable linkers that respond to various stimuli. [12] 20][21][22][23] A critical insight to emerge from these studies is that charged, but net neutral (i.e. zwitterionic) functional groups can effectively shield the hydrophobicity of the payload and improve in vivo targeting performance.\n\nHerein, we detail a cleavable zwitterionic linker strategy utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads. [28,29] [32] In this work, we fuse these two fundamental chemistries such that upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination unveils a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2elimination to release the payload (Figure 1B)."

This approach enables the traceless release of therapeutic agents upon exposure to thiol-rich environments such as those found inside cancer cells.

By incorporating hydrophilic components such as glutamic acid, this approach addresses limitations of traditional Val-Cit platforms while improving ADC stability and performance. Exolinker ADCs have demonstrated reduced premature payload release, increased drug-to-antibody ratios, and enhanced stability in the presence of various enzymes including carboxylesterases and human neutrophil elastase <Paper corpusId=\"273373628\" paperTitle=\"(Watanabe et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese traceless linker innovations collectively address key challenges in ADC development by improving circulation stability while ensuring efficient and complete payload release at target sites.

In the early 1980s, the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolate linker chemistry was developed by Carl et al. for use in prodrug design (Carl et al., 1981). Since then, the PABC linker type has been extensively utilized in ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADC. Upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes after ADC internalization into the target cells, the PABC spacer in the vc-PAB-MMAE linker/payload goes through a cascade of disassembly reactions and facilitates the release of untethered MMAE intracellularly [197]. The vc-PABC linker exhibits superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profile compared to the earlier cleavable linker generations, such as the pH-sensitive hydrazone linker used in calicheamicin-based ADCs or disulfide reducible linker used in DM1-based ADCs (Polakis, 2016)",

This spacer facilitates a stable disulfide bridge, leading to enhanced plasma PK while allowing a rapid traceless release of free payloads intracellularly. This technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to the conventional peptide-PABC linker technology (Pillow et al., 2017). In this study, both the conventional peptide-ADC and the self-immolative disulfide-ADC displayed similar in vivo potency."

This design, which incorporates hydrophilic glutamic acid, addresses the limitations of the Val-Cit platform and improves the ADC in vivo profiles. In vitro and in vivo evaluations showed that exolinker ADCs reduced premature payload release, increased drug-to-antibody ratios, and avoided significant aggregation, even with hydrophobic payloads. Furthermore, the payload remained stably attached to the ADC even in the presence of enzymes like carboxylesterases and human neutrophil elastase, indicating the potential for a favorable safety profile."

These innovative linker designs incorporate charged groups, PEG chains, sulfonate moieties, and specialized zwitterionic structures to enhance ADC pharmacokinetics while maintaining efficient payload delivery. (8 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe development of hydrophilic and zwitterionic linkers has emerged as a critical innovation in addressing key limitations of early ADC designs, particularly those related to payload hydrophobicity. Highly hydrophobic payloads can destabilize the native antibody structure and increase self-association and aggregation propensity, which directly impacts ADC stability, safety, and efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"44081710\" paperTitle=\"(Buecheler et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This recognition has driven significant research into linker chemistries that can balance payload hydrophobicity while maintaining stability in circulation.\n\nSeveral hydrophilic linker technologies have been developed to improve ADC stability and pharmacokinetics. These include sulfonate-containing linkers, polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, polysarcosine (PSAR), and even DNA-based linkers, all of which have demonstrated significant improvements in ADC stability and pharmacokinetic profiles <Paper corpusId=\"255967333\" paperTitle=\"(Conilh et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The incorporation of these hydrophilic elements has led to less toxic and more active ADCs by reducing nonspecific uptake and improving circulation stability <Paper corpusId=\"255967333\" paperTitle=\"(Conilh et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11154466\" paperTitle=\"(Ratanji et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent advances in non-cleavable linker technology include SMCC (Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) linkers and MD (Molecular Dynamics) linkers. SMCC linkers incorporate a cyclo-nucleic acid ring that reduces hydrolysis rates at high pH, enhancing stability while preserving antibody specificity. MD linkers further improve on this design by substituting the cyclo-nucleic acid ring with 1,3-dioxolein, which contains two oxygen atoms that enhance linker hydrophilicity and stability <Paper corpusId=\"265004291\" paperTitle=\"(Song et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nEnzyme-responsive hydrophilic linkers represent another area of innovation. \u03b2-glucuronidase and \u03b2-galactosidase responsive linkers have been developed that maintain stability in circulation but undergo enzymatic cleavage in lysosomes <Paper corpusId=\"265004291\" paperTitle=\"(Song et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, arylsulfate-containing ADC linkers have been shown to be cleaved by lysosomal sulfatase enzymes, resulting in traceless payload release while avoiding stability issues associated with dipeptide linkers <Paper corpusId=\"212949379\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These linkers demonstrate superior stability, solubility, and synthetic tractability compared to widely used dipeptidic linkers.\n\nThe incorporation of PEG spacers has also proven beneficial in enzyme-responsive linker designs. Research has shown that conjugates bearing a PEG4 spacer can effectively inhibit the proliferation of target cells at low nanomolar concentrations when used with \u03b2-glucuronidase-responsive linkers <Paper corpusId=\"131778513\" paperTitle=\"(Rivas et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, 3-O-sulfo-\u03b2-galactose linkers, which are sequentially cleaved by two lysosomal enzymes (arylsulfatase A and \u03b2-galactosidase), have demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity and selectivity when used in HER2-targeting ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"232159000\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPerhaps most innovative are zwitterionic linker strategies that utilize charged but net-neutral functional groups to effectively shield payload hydrophobicity. A recent advancement in this area involves cleavable zwitterionic linkers utilizing tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1-ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design combines two fundamental chemistries: upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination reveals a nitrogen lone pair that subsequently undergoes spontaneous 1,2-elimination to release the payload <Paper corpusId=\"274858190\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach represents a significant improvement in balancing the hydrophobicity of payloads while maintaining efficient release mechanisms.\n\nThe evolution of hydrophilic and zwitterionic linker technologies has significantly advanced ADC development by addressing key challenges related to stability, aggregation, and off-target toxicity. These linker designs effectively balance the hydrophobicity of cytotoxic payloads while maintaining efficient release mechanisms, ultimately improving the therapeutic window of antibody-drug conjugates.",

                            "In silico screening of toxin payloads typically employed in ADCs revealed a wide range of hydrophobicities and sizes as measured by log P and topological polar surface area (tPSA) values. These descriptors were used to identify three nontoxic surrogate payloads that encompass the range of hydrophobicity defined by the ADC toxin training set. The uniform drug to antibody ratio (DAR) ADCs were prepared for each surrogate payload by conjugation to the interchain cysteine residues of a model IgG1 subtype mAb. Linkage of these surrogate payloads to a common mAb with a matched DAR value allowed for preliminary analytical interrogation of the influence of payload hydrophobicity on global structure, self-association, and aggregation properties. The results of differential scanning fluorimetry and dynamic light scattering experiments clearly revealed a direct correlation between the destabilization of the native mAb structure and the increasing payload hydrophobicity. Also, self-association/aggregation propensity examined by self-interaction biolayer interferometry or size exclusion HPLC was consistent with increased conversion of the monomeric mAb to higher order aggregated species, with the degree of conversion directly proportional to the payload hydrophobicity. In summary, these findings prove that the payload-dependent structure destabilization and enhanced propensity to self-associate/aggregate driven by the increasing payload hydrophobicity contribute to reduced ADC stability and more complex behavior when assessing exposure and safety/efficacy relationships."

                            "The linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex",

                            "Abstract The elicitation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against biotherapeutics can have detrimental effects on drug safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. The immunogenicity of biotherapeutics is, therefore, an important issue. There is evidence that protein aggregation can result in enhanced immunogenicity; however, the precise immunological and biochemical mechanisms responsible are poorly defined. In the context of biotherapeutic drug development and safety assessment, understanding the mechanisms underlying aggregate immunogenicity is of considerable interest. This review provides an overview of the phenomenon of protein aggregation, the production of unwanted aggregates during bioprocessing, and how the immune response to aggregated protein differs from that provoked by non-aggregated protein. Of particular interest is the nature of the interaction of aggregates with the immune system and how subsequent ADA responses are induced. Pathways considered here include \u2018classical\u2019 activation of the immune system involving antigen presenting cells and, alternatively, the breakdown of B-cell tolerance. Additionally, methods available to screen for aggregation and immunogenicity will be described. With an increased understanding of aggregation-enhanced immune responses, it may be possible to develop improved manufacturing and screening processes to avoid, or at least reduce, the problems associated with ADA."

SMCC linkers incorporate a cyclo-nucleic acid ring that reduces the antibody conjugate's hydrolysis rate at high pH levels, thus bolstering stability while preserving antibody specificity. On the other hand, MD linkers substitute the cyclo-nucleic acid ring of SMCC linkers with 1,3-dioxolein, enhancing linker hydrophilicity and stability due to the presence of two oxygen atoms within the 1,3-dioxolein ring (Figure 4)",

These two components are joined by a covalent linker, whose nature is critical to the efficacy and safety of the ADC. Enzyme-cleavable dipeptidic linkers have emerged as a particularly effective ADC linker type due to their ability to selectively release the payload in the lysosomes of target cells. However, these linkers have a number of drawbacks, including instability in rodent plasma and their inherently high hydrophobicity. Here we show that arylsulfate-containing ADC linkers are cleaved by lysosomal sulfatase enzymes to tracelessly release their payload, while circumventing the instability problems associated with dipeptide-linkers. When incorporated with trastuzumab and the highly potent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, the arylsulfate-containing ADC 2 and ADC 3 were more cytotoxic than the non-cleavable ADC 4 against HER2-positive cells, while maintaining selectivity over HER2-negative cells. We propose that the stability, solubility and synthetic tractability of our arylsulfate linkers make them an attractive new motif for cleavable ADC linkers, with clear benefits over the widely used dipeptidic linkers."

                            "Targeted drug delivery strategies combine a targeting agent and a payload molecule through a cleavable linker. [1,2] [5] The success of an ADC depends on the careful selection of appropriate payloads, optimization of antibody characteristics, and the use of linkers that cleave only after target engagement. [6,7] 10] An appealing strategy is to engineer the linker domain to improve the overall physical properties of the ADC.\n\nExisting linkers often rely on the self-immolative paraamino benzyl (PAB) spacer unit, which was first introduced for biological applications by Katzenellenbogen in 1981. [11] ased on an efficient and general 1,6-elimination (Figure 1A), this approach has been widely used to create cleavable linkers that respond to various stimuli. [12] 20][21][22][23] A critical insight to emerge from these studies is that charged, but net neutral (i.e. zwitterionic) functional groups can effectively shield the hydrophobicity of the payload and improve in vivo targeting performance.\n\nHerein, we detail a cleavable zwitterionic linker strategy utilizing the tandem 1,6-1,2-elimination of benzyl \u03b1ammonium carbamates (BACs). This design was inspired by prior examples that applied the individual reaction components. The 1,6-elimination of quaternary amines has been applied to prepare ADCs with tertiary-and heteroarylamine payloads. [28,29] [32] In this work, we fuse these two fundamental chemistries such that upon trigger cleavage, 1,6-elimination unveils a nitrogen lone pair that undergoes spontaneous 1,2elimination to release the payload (Figure 1B)."

Among these advancements, tandem linkers and exolinkers stand out for their ability to address persistent challenges in ADC development, particularly premature payload release.\n\nTandem cleavable linkers represent a novel approach that requires sequential enzymatic cleavage events to release the cytotoxic payload. These sophisticated designs incorporate a \u03b2-glucuronide moiety that provides protection against extracellular enzymatic degradation during circulation <Paper corpusId=\"269587315\" paperTitle=\"(Takakura et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategic modification addresses a significant limitation of traditional peptide linkers, which are often vulnerable to cleavage by extracellular enzymes such as elastase, resulting in systemic payload release and off-target toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"269587315\" paperTitle=\"(Takakura et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232191243\" paperTitle=\"(Chuprakov et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. By requiring two sequential enzymatic cleavage events, tandem linkers effectively reduce premature payload release, thereby minimizing off-target toxicity while maintaining efficient drug delivery to tumor cells <Paper corpusId=\"269587315\" paperTitle=\"(Takakura et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother significant advancement is the development of exolinkers, which reposition the cleavable peptide linker at the exo position of the p-aminobenzylcarbamate moiety. This innovative design incorporates hydrophilic components such as glutamic acid to address limitations of conventional Val-Cit platforms <Paper corpusId=\"273373628\" paperTitle=\"(Watanabe et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Exolinker ADCs have demonstrated reduced premature payload release, increased drug-to-antibody ratios, and improved stability even with hydrophobic payloads. Notably, these constructs maintain stability in the presence of problematic enzymes including carboxylesterases and human neutrophil elastase, suggesting potential for enhanced safety profiles <Paper corpusId=\"273373628\" paperTitle=\"(Watanabe et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSimilarly, specialized peptide sequences such as glutamic acid-glycine-citrulline (EGCit) linkers have been developed to resist neutrophil protease-mediated degradation while preserving the capacity for traceless drug release. These linkers have demonstrated protection of differentiating human neutrophils without compromising ADC therapeutic efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"250337069\" paperTitle=\"(Ha et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe development of these specialized linker technologies addresses a critical challenge in ADC therapy: balancing stability in circulation with efficient payload release at target sites. As noted by Balamkundu et al., despite significant advances in linker-payload design leading to increased regulatory approvals, dose-limiting toxicity remains a concern in clinical trials, partly attributable to systemic payload release and suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The introduction of more stable linker systems, particularly those with specific peptide/peptidomimetic sequences, can significantly reduce premature cleavage at non-tumor sites, thereby enhancing ADC safety profiles <Paper corpusId=\"265324669\" paperTitle=\"(Balamkundu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese specialized linker designs represent important steps toward addressing persistent challenges in ADC development. By strategically controlling payload release through multiple cleavage steps or optimized linker positioning, tandem linkers and exolinkers contribute to improved stability, reduced off-target toxicity, and enhanced therapeutic indices for ADC therapies.",

                            "Although peptide motifs represent the majority of cleavable linkers used in clinical-stage antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the sequences are often sensitive to cleavage by extracellular enzymes, such as elastase, leading to systemic release of the cytotoxic payload. This action reduces the therapeutic index by causing off-target toxicities that can be dose-limiting. For example, a common side-effect of ADCs made using peptide-cleavable linkers is myelosuppression, including neutropenia. Only a few reports describe methods for optimizing peptide linkers to maintain efficient and potent tumor payload delivery while enhancing circulating stability. Herein, we address these critical limitations through the development of a tandem-cleavage linker strategy, where two sequential enzymatic cleavage events mediate payload release. We prepared dipeptides that are protected from degradation in the circulation by a sterically-encumbering glucuronide moiety. Upon ADC internalization and lysosomal degradation, the monosaccharide is removed and the exposed dipeptide is degraded, liberating the attached payload inside the target cell. We used CD79b-targeted monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugates as our model system, and compared the stability, efficacy, and tolerability of ADCs made with tandem-cleavage linkers to ADCs made using standard technology with the vedotin linker. The results\u2014where rat studies showed dramatically improved tolerability in the hematopoietic compartment\u2014highlight the role that linker stability plays in efficacy and tolerability, and offer a means of improving an ADC\u2019s therapeutic index for improved patient outcomes."

This design, which incorporates hydrophilic glutamic acid, addresses the limitations of the Val-Cit platform and improves the ADC in vivo profiles. In vitro and in vivo evaluations showed that exolinker ADCs reduced premature payload release, increased drug-to-antibody ratios, and avoided significant aggregation, even with hydrophobic payloads. Furthermore, the payload remained stably attached to the ADC even in the presence of enzymes like carboxylesterases and human neutrophil elastase, indicating the potential for a favorable safety profile."

                            "The immense research effort put into ADC linker-payload design during the past decade has contributed to a sharp increase in regulatory approvals. However, ADC development still faces dose-limiting toxicity issues during clinical trials, which could be partly attributed to the systemic release of the payload and poor PK properties. The development of more stable linker systems in mouse and rat plasma would accelerate the preclinical evaluation of the ADC drug candidates. In particular, the identification of new peptide/peptidomimetic sequences will allow highly specific cleavage, which can greatly reduce premature cleavage of the linker at non-tumor sites, hence increasing the safety profiles of the ADCs. Obviously, the linker systems reviewed herein apply only to typical ADCs which rely on binding to an internalizing antigen and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the payload via lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless, recent years have also seen growing interest in developing an atypical class of ADCs targeting poorly- or non-internalizing antigens on cancer cells or components of surrounding tumor stroma. For these ADCs, the linkers are cleaved extracellularly within the tumor microenvironment to release the payload, which can then diffuse into nearby cancer cells for selective killing."

Linker design directly impacts conjugate stability, modulates cytotoxic agent release kinetics, and shapes overall pharmacokinetic profiles <Paper corpusId=\"251880235\" paperTitle=\"(Chis et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232774369\" paperTitle=\"(Zhong et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"238745220\" paperTitle=\"(Lindberg et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This multifaceted influence extends to both efficacy and safety outcomes, making linker selection a pivotal decision in ADC development.\n\nThe choice between different linker types entails various performance trade-offs. Cleavable linkers containing disulfide bonds, which are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, may offer advantages for treating specific cancer types including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, where increased tumor glutathione levels have been documented <Paper corpusId=\"276971806\" paperTitle=\"(Buyukgolcigezli et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235213516\" paperTitle=\"(Kostova et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Such mechanism-targeted approaches highlight how linker design can be tailored to exploit specific tumor biochemistry.\n\nProtease-cleavable linkers represent another category that balances plasma stability with targeted drug release. These linkers remain intact in circulation but undergo rapid cleavage by lysosomal enzymes upon cellular internalization, leveraging the high protease activity within these compartments <Paper corpusId=\"277415246\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This selective release mechanism is essential for controlling the toxicity of the highly potent drugs typically used in ADC construction.\n\nThe interplay between linker parameters - including conjugation chemistry, linker length, and steric hindrance - significantly affects ADC pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity profiles. Achieving the optimal balance between ADC stability in circulation and efficient payload release at the target site remains a central challenge in linker design <Paper corpusId=\"277415246\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235599751\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This balance is particularly critical for site-specific antibody-drug conjugates, where precise control over drug release kinetics can dramatically influence therapeutic outcomes.\n\nImportantly, the ideal linker chemistry ultimately depends on experimental determination of the optimal combination specific to each ADC. The selection must consider the properties of the target antigen, the characteristics of the payload, and the desired pharmacokinetic profile <Paper corpusId=\"277415246\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"14674766\" paperTitle=\"(Jackson et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This integrated approach to linker design, considering the entire ADC system rather than the linker in isolation, has proven successful in developing effective therapeutics with improved safety profiles.\n\nThe development of novel dosing strategies, such as dose fractionation approaches, can further optimize the performance of ADCs with different linker designs. These strategies provide valuable guidance for establishing optimal dosing regimens in pre-clinical models and potentially in clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"235599751\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies.

These biologic drugs are structurally more complex than small molecules, and yet share a similar principle for rational drug discovery and development: That is to start with a pre-defined target and follow with the functional modulation with a therapeutic agent. Despite these tremendous successes, this \"one target one drug\" paradigm has been challenged by complex disease mechanisms that involve multiple pathways and demand new therapeutic routes. A rapidly evolving wave of multispecific biotherapeutics is coming into focus. These new therapeutic drugs are able to engage two or more protein targets via distinct binding interfaces with or without the chemical conjugation to large or small molecules. They possess the potential to not only address disease intricacy but also exploit new therapeutic mechanisms and assess undruggable targets for conventional monospecific biologics. This review focuses on the recent advances in molecular design and applications of major classes of multispecific biotherapeutics drugs, which include immune cells engagers, antibody-drug conjugates, multispecific tetherbodies, biologic matchmakers, and small-scaffold multispecific modalities. Challenges posed by the multispecific biotherapeutics drugs and their future outlooks are also discussed."

Currently, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are the most common drug conjugates used clinically as cancer treatments. While providing both efficacy and favorable tolerability, ADCs have limitations due to their size and complexity. Peptides as tumor-targeting carriers in peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) offer a number of benefits. Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) is a highly lipophilic PDC that takes a novel approach by utilizing increased aminopeptidase activity to selectively increase the release and concentration of cytotoxic alkylating agents inside tumor cells. The only other PDC approved currently for clinical use is 177Lu-dotatate, a targeted form of radiotherapy combining a somatostatin analog with a radionuclide. It is approved as a treatment for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Results with other PDCs combining synthetic analogs of natural peptide ligands with cytotoxic agents have been mixed. The field of drug conjugates as drug delivery systems for the treatment of cancer continues to advance with the application of new technologies. Melflufen provides a paradigm for rational PDC design, with a targeted mechanism of action and the potential for deepening responses to treatment, maintaining remissions, and eradicating therapy-resistant stem cells."

Besides a number of approved drugs already on the market, there is a formidable follow-up of ADC candidates in clinical development. While selection of the appropriate antibody (A) and drug payload (D) is dictated by the pharmacology of the targeted disease, one has a broader choice of the conjugating linker (C). In the present paper, we review the chemistry of ADCs with a particular emphasis on the medicinal chemistry perspective, focusing on the chemical methods that enable the efficient assembly of the ADC from its three components and the controlled release of the drug payload."

They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence recognized and cleaved by these proteases. The primary goal of all linkers in ADCs is to ensure the specific release of the active drug within target cells, which is essential for controlling the toxicity of the highly potent drugs used to construct ADCs. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity changes for the above-mentioned linkers. Moreover, the ideal linker chemistry choice ultimately depends on experimentally determining the optimal combination of the suitable linker, the ideal target antigen, and the desired payload (Jackson et al., 2014)(Su et al., 2021)."

In particular, linker design plays a critical role in modulating ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency in the tumors, which thus affects ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads. We also propose to conduct dose fractionation studies to gain guidance for optimal dosing regimens of ADCs in pre-clinical models."

The challenge with each therapy is finding the balance between maximizing the anti-tumor efficacy while minimizing the dose limiting toxicities. Antibodies, unlike small molecule chemotherapeutics, selectively bind to cell surface tumor antigens and can be used to deliver radionucleotides or small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs directly to the tumor. Advances in antibody engineering, linker chemistry and the identification of potent cytotoxic drugs led to the recent approval of two antibody drug conjugates to treat breast cancer and lymphoma patients. We will discuss how the observations from the clinical development of antibody drug conjugates can guide the preclinical development of the next generation of antibody drug conjugates."
