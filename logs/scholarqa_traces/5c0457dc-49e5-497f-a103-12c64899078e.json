Tripathi\n## Abstract\nAn ideal vaccine provides long lasting protection against a pathogen by eliciting a well-rounded immune response which engages both innate and adaptive immunity. However, we have a limited understanding of how components of innate immunity, antibody and cell-mediated adaptive immunity interact and function together at a systems level. With advances in high-throughput \u2018Omics\u2019 methodologies it has become possible to capture global changes in the host, at a cellular and molecular level, that are induced by vaccination and infection. Analysis of these datasets has shown the promise of discovering mechanisms behind vaccine mediated protection, immunological memory, adverse effects as well as development of more efficient antigens and adjuvants. In this review, we will discuss how systems vaccinology takes advantage of new technology platforms and big data analysis, to enable the rational development of better vaccines.\n## Antigen Discovery and Development\nTraditionally, mapping of immunodominant B cell epitopes required identification of the whole protein first, followed by the assessment of its fragments for reactivity with antibodies. This approach to antigen discovery and epitope mapping is time consuming, labor intensive and expensive. Advances in Omics approaches, such as protein microarrays to map the reactivity of antibodies and T cells to antigens, availability of various databases related to host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, tools for structural analyses and computational capabilities for theoretical predictions have tremendously helped in antigen discovery [5][6][7]. In particular, the in silico analytical and predictive methods have greatly facilitated all aspects of biological research including vaccinology. The approach of reverse vaccinology has become an integral part of rational vaccine design. This involves computational mining and analysis of large datasets related to immune responses to pathogens, host-pathogen interactions and host and pathogens genomes to predict promising antigen candidates.

Rappuoli, M. Bottomley, U. D\u2019Oro, O. Finco, E. De Gregorio\n## Abstract\nRappuoli et al. illustrate how new breakthroughs in the field of human immunology can be combined with insights from structural and computational biology for the rational design of novel broadly protective immunogens, potentiating the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases that still present an important unmet medical need.\n## body\nTraditionally, vaccines have been developed empirically by isolating, inactivating, and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them) that cause disease (Table 1; Rappuoli, 2014).Two decades ago, genome sequencing revolutionized this process, allowing for the discovery of novel vaccine antigens starting directly from genomic information.The process was named \"reverse vaccinology\" to underline that vaccine design was possible starting from sequence information without the need to grow pathogens (Rappuoli, 2000).Indeed, a vaccine against meningococcus B, the first deriving from reverse vaccinology, has recently been licensed (Serruto et al., 2012;O'Ryan et al., 2014).Today, a new wave of technologies in the fields of human immunology and structural biology provide the molecular information that allows for the discovery and design of vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human CMV (HCMV) that have been impossible thus far and to propose universal vaccines to tackle influenza and HIV infections.Here, we provide our perspective (summarized in Table 1) of how several new advances, some of which have been partially discussed elsewhere (Burton, 2002;Dormitzer et al., 2012;Haynes et al., 2012), can be synergized to become the engine driving what might be considered a new era in vaccinology, an era in which we perform \"reverse vaccinology 2.0.\"\n\nSeveral technological breakthroughs over the past decade have potentiated vaccine design.First, the greatly enhanced ability to clone human B cells and then to produce the corresponding recombinant mAbs or antigen-binding fragments (Fab's) has provided access to an enormously rich set of reagents that allows for the proper evaluation of the protective human immune response to any given immunogen upon immunization or infection.A fundamental step for the success of this approach has been the growing capacity to select the most favorable donors for the isolation of the most potent antibodies (Abs) through extensive examination of serum-functional Ab responses.",

A well-known example of this application is the production of the hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) in Escherichia coli, which has led to the first recombinant protein-based vaccines reaching the market using alum as adjuvant (Engerix-B\u00ae from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Recombivax HB\u00ae from Merck & Co., Inc.). Similarly, antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV), expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and Trichoplusia ni, are commercialised as Gardasil\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Cervarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), with alum and AS04\u00ae (a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)) as adjuvants, respectively. Other pathogens for which recombinant protein antigens have been identified and studied include hepatitis C and E and rotavirus (Ohtake and Arakawa, 2013). \n\nThe concept of \"reverse vaccinology\", focussed on the scan of the whole genome of the pathogen for identification of antigenic protein candidates, represented an important advance towards the development of new vaccines. This strategy has led to the development, for example, of a new meningococcal vaccine, commercialised in Europe under the brand name of Bexsero\u00ae (by Novartis Vaccines). Vaccines against pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Leishmania infantum, among others, have also been investigated using this approach (Donati and Rappuoli, 2013).",

Alonso, M. de la Fuente\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Recombinant proteins\nRecombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of several proteins with antigenic activity, using expression vectors such as bacteria or yeast. A well-known example of this application is the production of the hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) in Escherichia coli, which has led to the first recombinant protein-based vaccines reaching the market using alum as adjuvant (Engerix-B\u00ae from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Recombivax HB\u00ae from Merck & Co., Inc.). Similarly, antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV), expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae and Trichoplusia ni, are commercialised as Gardasil\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Cervarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), with alum and AS04\u00ae (a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)) as adjuvants, respectively. Other pathogens for which recombinant protein antigens have been identified and studied include hepatitis C and E and rotavirus (Ohtake and Arakawa, 2013). \n\nThe concept of \"reverse vaccinology\", focussed on the scan of the whole genome of the pathogen for identification of antigenic protein candidates, represented an important advance towards the development of new vaccines. This strategy has led to the development, for example, of a new meningococcal vaccine, commercialised in Europe under the brand name of Bexsero\u00ae (by Novartis Vaccines). Vaccines against pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Leishmania infantum, among others, have also been investigated using this approach (Donati and Rappuoli, 2013).",

Early vaccines were developed empirically however, rational design of vaccines can allow us to optimise their efficacy, by tailoring the immune response. Establishing the immune correlates of protection greatly informs the rational design of vaccines. This facilitates the selection of the best vaccine antigens and the most appropriate vaccine adjuvant to generate optimal memory immune T cell and B cell responses. This review outlines the range of vaccine types that are currently authorised and those under development. We outline the optimal immunological correlates of protection that can be targeted. Finally we review approaches to rational antigen selection and rational vaccine adjuvant design. Harnessing current knowledge on protective immune responses in combination with critical vaccine components is imperative to the prevention of future life-threatening diseases.",

Induction of robust antibody responses by vaccines requires inclusion of relevant antigenic epitopes for B cells as well as T cell peptide epitopes to elicit appropriate T helper (Th) cell activation and assistance to B cells. Hence, selection of the optimal antigen is imperative in vaccine design. \n\nA successful strategy in the selection of the antigenic determinants as \"subunit\" vaccines is the isolation and inactivation of essential components of the pathogenic organism [69]. Chemically inactivated toxins isolated from bacteria have been exploited for diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This approach has also been pursued for subunit vaccines based on purified polysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, such as those developed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Salmonella typhi Vi. Saccharide-based vaccines have also been developed in multivalent forms to provide protection against numerous serotypes and serogroups [70]. \n\nCurrent strategies utilize reverse vaccinology approaches to select promising glyco-or protein-derived antigens based on structural studies of the target epitopes of potent antibodies [71,72]. Rational, structure-guided vaccine design can also involve the development of structurally simpler immunogens that present well-defined minimal epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, serving as epitope mimics for elicitation of more focused immune responses [73]. When refined recombinant or synthetic subunit vaccines are designed, the structural features of the antigen may strongly impact the desired antibody-response. \n\nStructural antigen vaccinology is a structural biology approach to design immunogenic antigens. It rationally aims to generate an effective antibody-inducing vaccine antigen, combining experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular biology, electron microscopy and mass spectrometry, with computational methods including molecular modeling, virtual screening and epitope prediction [74]. The identification of an antigen candidate is typically based on its cellular location.",

Another example is the licensed 4-component vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) composed of three recombinant proteins and a bacterial membrane vesicle selected using a reverse vaccinology approach (Section 2.2) [13]. Structure-based design was subsequently used to generate a vaccine made of chimeric antigens, by retaining epitopes from two antigens (fHbp and PorA), thus potentiating its power to elicit functional humoral immune responses against MenB [83]. These two examples illustrate that structural vacci-nology can generate novel vaccine antigen candidates with improved characteristics for antibody-based strategies. \n\nThe potential improvement in the identification of antigenic determinants expressed on cancer cells enabled the design of therapeutic subunit vaccine to treat cancer [84][85][86]. Although the use of cancer vaccines awaits meaningful clinical benefits several tumorassociated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are currently largely validated and have been used to design promising molecular vaccines. Conjugation of these TACAs to proteins or the development of altered-self, i.e., more immunogenic, TACA analogues are examples of current strategies to make TACA-based vaccines able to break immune tolerance and elicit cancer antigen-specific antibodies [87].",

McClean\n## Abstract\nVaccines are the most effective medical intervention due to their continual success in preventing infections and improving mortality worldwide. Early vaccines were developed empirically however, rational design of vaccines can allow us to optimise their efficacy, by tailoring the immune response. Establishing the immune correlates of protection greatly informs the rational design of vaccines. This facilitates the selection of the best vaccine antigens and the most appropriate vaccine adjuvant to generate optimal memory immune T cell and B cell responses. This review outlines the range of vaccine types that are currently authorised and those under development. We outline the optimal immunological correlates of protection that can be targeted. Finally we review approaches to rational antigen selection and rational vaccine adjuvant design. Harnessing current knowledge on protective immune responses in combination with critical vaccine components is imperative to the prevention of future life-threatening diseases.\n## Rational Antigens for Antibody Immunity\nShould immunological data indicate that a disease can be prevented by an antibody response, it is important to select an appropriate antibody-inducing antigen. Induction of robust antibody responses by vaccines requires inclusion of relevant antigenic epitopes for B cells as well as T cell peptide epitopes to elicit appropriate T helper (Th) cell activation and assistance to B cells. Hence, selection of the optimal antigen is imperative in vaccine design. \n\nA successful strategy in the selection of the antigenic determinants as \"subunit\" vaccines is the isolation and inactivation of essential components of the pathogenic organism [69]. Chemically inactivated toxins isolated from bacteria have been exploited for diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This approach has also been pursued for subunit vaccines based on purified polysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, such as those developed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Salmonella typhi Vi. Saccharide-based vaccines have also been developed in multivalent forms to provide protection against numerous serotypes and serogroups [70]. \n\nCurrent strategies utilize reverse vaccinology approaches to select promising glyco-or protein-derived antigens based on structural studies of the target epitopes of potent antibodies [71,72]. Rational, structure-guided vaccine design can also involve the development of structurally simpler immunogens that present well-defined minimal epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, serving as epitope mimics for elicitation of more focused immune responses [73]. When refined recombinant or synthetic subunit vaccines are designed, the structural features of the antigen may strongly impact the desired antibody-response. \n\nStructural antigen vaccinology is a structural biology approach to design immunogenic antigens. It rationally aims to generate an effective antibody-inducing vaccine antigen, combining experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular biology, electron microscopy and mass spectrometry, with computational methods including molecular modeling, virtual screening and epitope prediction [74]. The identification of an antigen candidate is typically based on its cellular location.\n...\nStructural vaccinology was fundamental to generate stabilized pre-F trimers that preserved key epitopes in the proper conformation to elicit the most neutralizing activity in human sera [81,82]. Another example is the licensed 4-component vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) composed of three recombinant proteins and a bacterial membrane vesicle selected using a reverse vaccinology approach (Section 2.2) [13]. Structure-based design was subsequently used to generate a vaccine made of chimeric antigens, by retaining epitopes from two antigens (fHbp and PorA), thus potentiating its power to elicit functional humoral immune responses against MenB [83]. These two examples illustrate that structural vacci-nology can generate novel vaccine antigen candidates with improved characteristics for antibody-based strategies. \n\nThe potential improvement in the identification of antigenic determinants expressed on cancer cells enabled the design of therapeutic subunit vaccine to treat cancer [84][85][86]. Although the use of cancer vaccines awaits meaningful clinical benefits several tumorassociated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are currently largely validated and have been used to design promising molecular vaccines. Conjugation of these TACAs to proteins or the development of altered-self, i.e., more immunogenic, TACA analogues are examples of current strategies to make TACA-based vaccines able to break immune tolerance and elicit cancer antigen-specific antibodies [87].",

The recombinant protein vaccines as the third-generation vaccines can induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular immune responses in the host (Fig. 1). In this type of vaccines, genes encoding protective antigens are recombinantly expressed (Baxter 2007) (Scott and Cheryl 2004). \n\nIn 1987, Hilleman M et al. developed Recombivax as the first recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B through cloning and recombinant expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hilleman 1987). Until now, numerous recombinant vaccines have been approved against viral pathogens such Human papilloma virus (Slade et al. 2009), Influenza (Girard et al. 2013), and bacterial pathogens including Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Jacobs et al. 1990) and Meningococcal (Cooper et al. 2011). \n\nRecently, a recombinant vaccine called shingrix has been developed against shingles disease caused by the varicella zoster virus with a high level protection (up to 90%) against this disease (Raedler 2018). One of the main challenges in the development of recombinant vaccines is the selection of the suitable target antigens. At present, reverse vaccinology is one of the promising approaches to identify repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, with surface exposure, and conserved among multiple strains (Rappuoli et al. 2016) (Zeng et al. 2017).",

Rahbarnia, S. Farajnia, B. Naghili, V. Ahmadzadeh, K. Veisi, Roghayyeh Baghban, Sayna Toraby\n## Abstract\nEscalating antibiotic resistance is now a serious menace to global public health. It may be led to the emergence of \u201cpostantibiotic age\u201d in which most of infections are untreatable. At present, there is an essential need to explore novel therapeutic strategies as a strong and sustainable pipeline to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. This review focuses on recent advances in this area including therapeutic antibodies, antimicrobial peptides, vaccines, gene therapy, genome editing, and phage therapy for tackling drug-resistant infections.\n## Recombinant protein vaccines\nThe production of recombinant proteins is one of the new approaches to create safe vaccines especially against nonculturable or difficult-to-culture viruses (Hudu et al. 2016) (Eisenstein 2011). The recombinant protein vaccines as the third-generation vaccines can induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular immune responses in the host (Fig. 1). In this type of vaccines, genes encoding protective antigens are recombinantly expressed (Baxter 2007) (Scott and Cheryl 2004). \n\nIn 1987, Hilleman M et al. developed Recombivax as the first recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B through cloning and recombinant expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hilleman 1987). Until now, numerous recombinant vaccines have been approved against viral pathogens such Human papilloma virus (Slade et al. 2009), Influenza (Girard et al. 2013), and bacterial pathogens including Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Jacobs et al. 1990) and Meningococcal (Cooper et al. 2011). \n\nRecently, a recombinant vaccine called shingrix has been developed against shingles disease caused by the varicella zoster virus with a high level protection (up to 90%) against this disease (Raedler 2018). One of the main challenges in the development of recombinant vaccines is the selection of the suitable target antigens. At present, reverse vaccinology is one of the promising approaches to identify repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, with surface exposure, and conserved among multiple strains (Rappuoli et al. 2016) (Zeng et al. 2017).",

Preclinical optimization and standardization of antigen dose is highly crucial for the clinical development of vaccines. In this present study, we have optimized the dose of HBsAg, Dengue and JEV recombinant antigens, through estimation of antibody titer by ELISA method (IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a) and Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of CD4+ and CD8+ surface markers in vivo in BALB/c mice and determined the minimum detectable antigen dose for immunization as well as antibody reactivity.

Introduction Conventional vaccines are developed by the attenuation or inactivation of pathogens. The antigenic part in the pathogens is responsible for inducing host immune response against pathogens and developing sufficient immunity against the pathogenic antigen is the superior goal for vaccine development. The success of vaccines primarily depends on the ability of antigens producing antibodymediated immunity whereas, managing cell-mediated immunity is important against intracellular organisms [1]. The choice of antigens is determined by their immunological efficacy and safety with or without the use of adjuvants [2]. Whereas the vaccine antigen intricacy may vary based on the state like the whole pathogen either inactivated, attenuated and split/subunit. Due to safety reasons, vaccines based on whole pathogens are being replaced by subunit and recombinant antigens and in this context, protein antigens and their epitopes are produced by the recombinant DNA technologies which make use of DNA sequence coding for the antigenic protein of the pathogen [3]. In view of the fact that antigens obtained abundantly not necessarily be the good vaccine candidates [4]. In order to improve vaccine efficacy, rational preclinical development of recombinant antigens and improved protocols for predicting the immunogenicity of antigens is an important endeavour. The efficacy of majority of the vaccine candidates prepared from purified recombinant antigens and peptides depends on the antigens alone, the success of subunit vaccines also depends on the adjuvants added to vaccine formulations to boost the immune response to the antigen [5,6]. Undoubtedly, investigation of the effect of dose of antigens on murine models before vaccine development is an important goal. Immunization protocols in mice models will integrate the biological complexities of the immune system and gives a maximum prediction of the efficacy as well as adverse effects [7]. In the present study, we have explored three recombinant antigens (HBsAg, JEV and DENV) for dose optimization required for screening the novel vaccine adjuvants or delivery systems.

One approach that mines pathogenic bacterial genomes for antigen discovery is known as \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV). RV has emerged as an effective strategy that uses bioinformatics techniques with the aim to identify highly protective and immunogenic peptides encoded by immunologically exposed pathogenicity factors by screening the entire genomes of microbial pathogens (Movahedi and Hampson, 2008;Seib et al., 2012;Donati and Rappuoli, 2013; Figure 2). RV based antigen discovery pipeline involves genome sequence analysis for the identification of antigenic proteins (surface exposed or secreted) expressed by the pathogen, their cloning and expression followed by synthetically producing each FIGURE 2 | Reverse Vaccinology approach: A schematic representation of vaccine development by RV is illustrated in the presented flowchart. RV starts with the computational analysis of the complete genome sequence of the targeted pathogenic organism. Computational predictions are based on algorithms trained on biological data obtained from experimentally carried out studies. The potential vaccine candidates include surface associated and secretory proteins (SASPs) and virulence factors. These are further evaluated to identify protein candidates with antigenic epitopes for B-cells and T-cells. These proteins are then amplified by PCR and expressed in suitable vectors. The recombinant proteins produced are purified and used for immunogenicity testing in animal models (mice). Based on immune sera screening (FACs, Serum Bactericidal Activity), the recombinant proteins capable of inducing sera bactericidal antibodies are selected. The top candidates enter the pre-clinical stage of vaccine development. After the molecular epidemiological studies, the best candidates are used for clinical trials in adults, adolescents and infants and finally they enter the vaccine formulation process. \n\nprotein. The best selected candidates could be tested in the clinical trials for validating their immunogenicity after in vitro immunogenicity examination in cells and animal models. The identified antigens may be targeted for vaccine discovery. To date, RV has been targeted to devise universal and effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens for which the discovery of vaccines was previously impossible.",

Thakur, G. Kumar, Y. Akhter\n## Abstract\nMycobacterial infections are one of the deadliest infectious diseases still posing a major health burden worldwide. The battle against these pathogens needs to focus on novel approaches and key interventions. In recent times, availability of genome scale data has revolutionized the fields of computational biology and immunoproteomics. Here, we summarize the cutting-edge \u2018omics\u2019 technologies and innovative system scale strategies exploited to mine the available data. These may be targeted using high-throughput technologies to expedite the identification of novel antigenic candidates for the rational next generation vaccines and serodiagnostic development against mycobacterial pathogens for which traditional methods have been failing.\n## Reverse Vaccinology (RV)\nToday, with the advent of genomic technology, the genomebased antigen selection is possible and allows the discovery of antigen and vaccine design. One approach that mines pathogenic bacterial genomes for antigen discovery is known as \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV). RV has emerged as an effective strategy that uses bioinformatics techniques with the aim to identify highly protective and immunogenic peptides encoded by immunologically exposed pathogenicity factors by screening the entire genomes of microbial pathogens (Movahedi and Hampson, 2008;Seib et al., 2012;Donati and Rappuoli, 2013; Figure 2). RV based antigen discovery pipeline involves genome sequence analysis for the identification of antigenic proteins (surface exposed or secreted) expressed by the pathogen, their cloning and expression followed by synthetically producing each FIGURE 2 | Reverse Vaccinology approach: A schematic representation of vaccine development by RV is illustrated in the presented flowchart. RV starts with the computational analysis of the complete genome sequence of the targeted pathogenic organism. Computational predictions are based on algorithms trained on biological data obtained from experimentally carried out studies. The potential vaccine candidates include surface associated and secretory proteins (SASPs) and virulence factors. These are further evaluated to identify protein candidates with antigenic epitopes for B-cells and T-cells. These proteins are then amplified by PCR and expressed in suitable vectors. The recombinant proteins produced are purified and used for immunogenicity testing in animal models (mice). Based on immune sera screening (FACs, Serum Bactericidal Activity), the recombinant proteins capable of inducing sera bactericidal antibodies are selected. The top candidates enter the pre-clinical stage of vaccine development. After the molecular epidemiological studies, the best candidates are used for clinical trials in adults, adolescents and infants and finally they enter the vaccine formulation process. \n\nprotein. The best selected candidates could be tested in the clinical trials for validating their immunogenicity after in vitro immunogenicity examination in cells and animal models. The identified antigens may be targeted for vaccine discovery. To date, RV has been targeted to devise universal and effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens for which the discovery of vaccines was previously impossible.",

Reverse vaccinology [16][17][18][19] has the potential to analyse genomes for potential antigens, initially scanning \"open reading frames\" (ORFs), then selecting proteins because they are open to surveillance by the host immune system. This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology was originally established and has been established by studying Neisseria meningitidis, which is responsible for meningococcal meningitis and sepsis. Vaccines are currently available for all serotypes, except that serogroup B. N. meningitidis ORFs were found initially [20,21]; 570 proteins were then identified, 350 expressed in vitro and 85 found to be surface exposed. Seven proteins elicited immunity over many strains. The culmination of this work was a \"universal\" vaccine for serogroup B based on five antigens [22]. This protovaccine, when used with Alum as adjuvant, induced murine bactericidal antibodies versus 78 % of 85 meningococcal strains drawn from the world population of N. meningitidis. Strain coverage increases to over 90 % when used with CpG or MF59 as adjuvant. \n\nAnother key illustration is Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic gramnegative bacterium found in the chronic adult inflammatory gum disease periodontitis. Initially, 370 ORFS were identified [23]; of these, 120 protein sequences were open to immune surveillance and 40 were positive for several sera. Two antigens were found to be protective in mice. \n\nYet another fascinating instance is provided by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a prime cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis [24,25].",

Flower, M. Davies, I. Doytchinova\n## Abstract\nThe identification of immunogenic whole-protein antigens is fundamental to the successful discovery of candidate subunit vaccines and their rapid, effective, and efficient transformation into clinically useful, commercially successful vaccine formulations. In the wider context of the experimental discovery of vaccine antigens, with particular reference to reverse vaccinology, this chapter adumbrates the principal computational approaches currently deployed in the hunt for novel antigens: genome-level prediction of antigens, antigen identification through the use of protein sequence alignment-based approaches, antigen detection through the use of subcellular location prediction, and the use of alignment-independent approaches to antigen discovery. Reference is also made to the recent emergence of various expert systems for protein antigen identification.\n## Reverse Vaccinology and the Experimental Identification of Antigens\nThus, a considerable number of potential, putative, and possible vaccine candidate antigens could be missed by conventional experimental approaches. Reverse vaccinology [16][17][18][19] has the potential to analyse genomes for potential antigens, initially scanning \"open reading frames\" (ORFs), then selecting proteins because they are open to surveillance by the host immune system. This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology was originally established and has been established by studying Neisseria meningitidis, which is responsible for meningococcal meningitis and sepsis. Vaccines are currently available for all serotypes, except that serogroup B. N. meningitidis ORFs were found initially [20,21]; 570 proteins were then identified, 350 expressed in vitro and 85 found to be surface exposed. Seven proteins elicited immunity over many strains. The culmination of this work was a \"universal\" vaccine for serogroup B based on five antigens [22]. This protovaccine, when used with Alum as adjuvant, induced murine bactericidal antibodies versus 78 % of 85 meningococcal strains drawn from the world population of N. meningitidis. Strain coverage increases to over 90 % when used with CpG or MF59 as adjuvant. \n\nAnother key illustration is Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic gramnegative bacterium found in the chronic adult inflammatory gum disease periodontitis. Initially, 370 ORFS were identified [23]; of these, 120 protein sequences were open to immune surveillance and 40 were positive for several sera. Two antigens were found to be protective in mice. \n\nYet another fascinating instance is provided by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a prime cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis [24,25].",

It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) [194][195][196][197]. Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity [197][198][199][200][201][202].

            "abstract": "Group A rotavirus (RVA) is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children globally, despite the availability of live\u2010attenuated vaccines. Challenges such as limited efficacy in low\u2010income regions, safety concerns for immunocompromised individuals, and cold\u2010chain dependency necessitate alternative vaccine strategies. Subunit vaccines, which use specific viral proteins to elicit immunity, provide a safer and more adaptable approach. This review highlights biotechnological advancements in producing subunit vaccines, focusing on recombinant expression systems like bacterial, yeast, insect, mammalian, and plant\u2010based platforms for scalable and cost\u2010effective production of viral proteins. Key innovations include molecular engineering, adjuvant development, and delivery system improvements to enhance vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Subunit vaccines and virus\u2010like particles expressed in various systems have demonstrated promising preclinical and clinical results, with some candidates nearing commercial readiness. Reverse vaccinology, combined with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, is driving the development of innovative multiepitope vaccines and antivirals. Strategies such as passive immunization, single\u2010chain antibodies, immunobiotics, and novel antivirals are also explored as alternative management options. The review also underscores advanced genome editing and reverse genetics approaches to improve vaccine design and antiviral therapies. These biotechnological interventions offer hope for equitable and effective control of rotavirus diarrhea, particularly in resource\u2010limited settings, and represent significant progress toward addressing current vaccine limitations.",

Apostolopoulos\n## Abstract\nSeveral modes of vaccine delivery have been developed in the last 25 years, which induce strong immune responses in pre-clinical models and in human clinical trials. Some modes of delivery include, adjuvants (aluminum hydroxide, Ribi formulation, QS21), liposomes, nanoparticles, virus like particles, immunostimulatory complexes (ISCOMs), dendrimers, viral vectors, DNA delivery via gene gun, electroporation or Biojector 2000, cell penetrating peptides, dendritic cell receptor targeting, toll-like receptors, chemokine receptors and bacterial toxins. There is an enormous amount of information and vaccine delivery methods available for guiding vaccine and immunotherapeutics development against diseases.\n## Technologies Used in the Generation of New Improved Vaccines\nThe application of genetic and recombinant DNA approaches to vaccination has led to new possibilities of safer and more efficient vaccines. Recombinant DNA technology can be applied to antigen identification and isolation, and by being able to clone and express all the antigens of an organism individually, overcomes two major hurdles associated with traditional vaccines. First, before the recombinant DNA era, it was difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of particular antigens in a pure enough form to allow the appropriate testing. Recombinant DNA technology overcame this problem, and second, recombinant DNA technology has made the study of pathogenic organisms safer because single genes and their translation products are examined rather than the whole organism [1][2][3].\n\nSynthetic peptide chemistry has greatly contributed to vaccinology, where peptides (2-100 amino acids) could be synthesized and used as immunogens, in addition to synthesizing T and B cell epitopes and used as vaccines. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X-ray crystallography approaches in understanding protein structures has contributed enormously into the generation of improved vaccines. Numerous peptide based vaccines have been shown effective in pre-clinical and in human clinical trials [4][5][6][7]. The advent of these technologies stimulated the production of new vaccines and the identification of precise epitopes on antigens has made synthetic peptide vaccines a real possibility. Such vaccines are designed to be safer and more efficient. Unfortunately, there are still many obstacles for their clinical use; the limited immunogenicity of many of these candidates has hindered their development as potential vaccines. Strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines are therefore required.\n...\nThe application of genetic and recombinant DNA approaches to vaccination has led to new possibilities of safer and more efficient vaccines.

A similar quantum jump in technology allowed the development of subunit vaccines against influenza, Hib and S. pneumoniae, as well as the production of antigens by recombinant DNA techniques (e.g., genetically inactivated PT). Despite the fact that these techniques enable the production of almost any foreseeable antigen, the identification of suitable targets still remained as a main bottleneck for vaccine development [120]. \n\nThe advent of genomics and its exploitation in the vaccinology field have rendered possible the implementation of a systematic and holistic approach for the screening, identification and prioritisation of candidate antigens. This new approach, called \"reverse vaccinology\" [121], does not require cultivation of the original pathogen, thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms. It is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico, which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems. The resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological and/or functional studies to select the most promising candidates (e.g., able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies, capacity to confer protective immunity). Flanking studies are usually carried out, such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains, or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections [122]. \n\nThe time-consuming process in which highly expressed components of an in vitro cultivable organism are identified (one at a time) and separated (different components between them) is one of the disadvantages that reverse vaccinology has solved. The conventional method usually requires 15-20 years to arrive to a clinical trial, whereas reverse vaccinology reduces the process to approximately 5 years. Reverse vaccinology also allows the identification of hundreds of potential candidates in a few days, in comparison with the small number of antigens that conventional approaches have provided after decades of research. Moreover, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility to select potential candidates independent of their expression levels or purification easiness.",

A similar quantum jump in technology allowed the development of subunit vaccines against influenza, Hib and S. pneumoniae, as well as the production of antigens by recombinant DNA techniques (e.g., genetically inactivated PT). Despite the fact that these techniques enable the production of almost any foreseeable antigen, the identification of suitable targets still remained as a main bottleneck for vaccine development [120]. \n\nThe advent of genomics and its exploitation in the vaccinology field have rendered possible the implementation of a systematic and holistic approach for the screening, identification and prioritisation of candidate antigens. This new approach, called \"reverse vaccinology\" [121], does not require cultivation of the original pathogen, thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms. It is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico, which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems. The resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological and/or functional studies to select the most promising candidates (e.g., able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies, capacity to confer protective immunity). Flanking studies are usually carried out, such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains, or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections [122]. \n\nThe time-consuming process in which highly expressed components of an in vitro cultivable organism are identified (one at a time) and separated (different components between them) is one of the disadvantages that reverse vaccinology has solved. The conventional method usually requires 15-20 years to arrive to a clinical trial, whereas reverse vaccinology reduces the process to approximately 5 years. Reverse vaccinology also allows the identification of hundreds of potential candidates in a few days, in comparison with the small number of antigens that conventional approaches have provided after decades of research. Moreover, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility to select potential candidates independent of their expression levels or purification easiness.",

Finally, rational antigen design is being explored for activation of dendritic cells (93) such as targeting C-type lectin receptors to activate antigen presentation in the context of the pathogens (e.g., Ebola and HIV) (94).",

High-throughput antibody isolation approaches have contributed to a better understanding of the B cell responses elicited following infection and/or vaccination. Structure-based approaches have illuminated species-specific and cross-protective epitopes of therapeutic value.

Others, like the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccines are made from whole inactivated viral particles (3,4), a strategy that has been recapitulated for experimental vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (5)(6)(7). In recent decades, the advent of a novel suite of technologies has enabled a more rational and targeted approach to the rapid discovery and development of immunogens for emerging pathogens (8,9). In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (10,11). These new technologies were first pioneered through research of viral pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, for which effective vaccines traditionally have been difficult to develop (11)(12)(13). The biology and methodologies elucidated by working on these other viruses have paid dividends for the development of countermeasures to other infectious diseases, particularly flaviviruses, which threaten the health of people throughout the world.",

Dussupt, K. Modjarrad, S. Krebs\n## Abstract\nThe unprecedented 2015\u20132016 Zika outbreak in the Americas sparked global concern and drove the rapid deployment of vaccine and therapeutic countermeasures against this re-emerging pathogen. Alongside vaccine development, a number of potent neutralizing antibodies against Zika and related flaviviruses have been identified in recent years. High-throughput antibody isolation approaches have contributed to a better understanding of the B cell responses elicited following infection and/or vaccination. Structure-based approaches have illuminated species-specific and cross-protective epitopes of therapeutic value. This review will highlight previously described monoclonal antibodies with the best therapeutic potential against ZIKV and related flaviviruses, and discuss their implications for the rational design of better vaccine strategies.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe first generation of flavivirus vaccines, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine, were developed empirically by serially passaging pathogenic virus in animal tissues until attenuated virus variants emerged that were suitable to be used as a safe, live and effective vaccine (1,2). Others, like the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccines are made from whole inactivated viral particles (3,4), a strategy that has been recapitulated for experimental vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (5)(6)(7). In recent decades, the advent of a novel suite of technologies has enabled a more rational and targeted approach to the rapid discovery and development of immunogens for emerging pathogens (8,9). In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (10,11). These new technologies were first pioneered through research of viral pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, for which effective vaccines traditionally have been difficult to develop (11)(12)(13). The biology and methodologies elucidated by working on these other viruses have paid dividends for the development of countermeasures to other infectious diseases, particularly flaviviruses, which threaten the health of people throughout the world.",

As an example, a reverse vaccinology process was recently applied, based on the notion that protective antigens could be identified by determining the antibody repertoire from infected or vaccinated individuals. 89,90 Fig. 3 demonstrates the identification of novel and the most effective epitopes using NGS and high-throughput robotic crystallization platforms to enable more precise prediction of epitope targets for efficient antibody generation. Webbased epitope databases, vaccine design resources, and protein structure comparison resources can help to improve our understanding of immune responses and the escape and evolution of pathogens. 91 As an example, there have been massive antibody engineering efforts to improve the breadth and potency of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. 92 Given the importance of neutralizing antibodies for vaccine protection, the dissection of antibody variable regions using reverse vaccinology tools is a rational approach to design vaccines and will ultimately lead to more effective vaccines for EIDs.",

            "text": "This is a modern method of developing vaccines. It involves the recombinant expression of proteins and viral vectors. This technology provides the possibility of developing vaccines against difficult-to-culture or non-culturable viruses and eliminates safety risks by using bioprocesses that are more controlled with defined process components and a shorter process of production, which is very important in terms of responding to a pandemic [70,71]. A typical example of a recombinant vaccine is Recombivax, a hepatitis B recombinant DNA vaccine, which was the first to be licensed. In this vaccine, recombinant hepatitis surface antigen is expressed in a yeast cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [25], in contrast to the original vaccine that was made by purifying HBV particles from infected blood [72]. Over the past decade, several new vaccines have been developed using recombinant technology. One common approach is reverse vaccinology, in which genome analysis is performed to identify a repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, surface exposed and conserved across multiple strains. \n\nThe most immunogenic epitopes are sequenced and evaluated for appropriateness for a vaccine formulation and then patented by a pharmaceutical company for commercialization. Recombinant vaccine technology will be key to future vaccine development considering the current outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral infections that are life-threatening and teratogenic, such as the Lassa virus, Ebola virus, and Zika virus. This is because the upstream process in recombinant vaccine technology is fast compared to cell culture and in egg production and does not require the handling of live virus and the accompanying expensive Biosafety containment equipment.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is a methodology that uses bioinformatics tools for the identification of structures from bacteria, virus, parasites, cancer cells, or allergens that could induce an immune response capable of protecting against a specific disease [7]. \n\nThis approach possesses many advantages over traditional vaccinology: it reduces time and cost in vaccine development; refines the number of proteins to be studied, facilitating the selection process; can identify antigens present in small amounts or expressed only at certain stages, which would hinder or prevent their purification; and allows for the study of noncultivable or risky microorganisms [3] An important requirement for utilizing this methodology is the availability of genomic information of the pathogen under study and, in some instances, even the human or animal cell genome must be known (i.e., DNA vaccines and therapeutic vaccines). Once the genome sequence is obtained, it is possible to identify all likely proteins that could be expressed. For this purpose, several software systems and programs identify all open reading frames (ORFs) that constitute the sequences expressing the majority of proteins [8][9][10]. \n\nThe next step in reverse vaccinology is to determine several antigenic and physicochemical properties that have been associated with good antigens. These characteristics must be analyzed for each protein in the proteome under study, employing different bioinformatics approaches to select the protein(s) with the best properties for testing through in vitro and in vivo assays, in order to demonstrate its safety and immunogenicity. With the best vaccine candidates, different types of vaccines can be designed and developed, for example: subunit, recombinant, and nucleic acid vaccines [11]. \n\nThe first application of reverse vaccinology was to study Neisseria meningitidis to obtain a new subunit vaccine based on the genome study of this microorganism by means of bioinformatics tools [12]. Thereafter, this technology has been used to study pathogenic agents including eukaryotic organisms and those involved in diseases transmitted by vectors [13], to design and obtain not only vaccines for humans but also for animals [5]. The majority of new vaccines against infectious diseases that have been developed with this technology are currently found in preclinical or clinical trial.",

            "text": "Vaccines have proven to be the most effective prophylactic strategy for infectious diseases 235 . However, traditional vaccine development approaches 236 , which rely on three categories of vaccines (live-attenuated, inactivated and dissociated pathogens), have failed for viruses such as HIV, RSV, influenza, hepatitis C virus, HCMV or EBOV.\n\nFor most vaccines, the antibody response is crucial and, thus, the identification of antibodies that can potently neutralize a pathogen is a key factor for accelerating vaccine development. Reverse vaccinology 2.0, also known as antibody-based vaccinology, aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by engineering novel vaccines based on the structural characterization of antigens in complex with their cognate antibodies, with the antigen-specific antibody response acting as a correlate of protection 237 (Fig. 5).\n\nAntigens are generally identified by proteomic analysis of crude homogenates of infected cells and, then, chosen based on immunogenicity and their ability to stimulate an immune response. However, this approach is time-consuming, and structural integrity or immunogenicity is not guaranteed upon expression of a newly identified protein. Experimentally driven isolation of neutralizing mAbs and identification of their target is still the best approach to identify vaccine candidates. One of the main advantages of antibody-driven vaccinology is isolation of potent neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs will be useful for passive immunization of immuno compromised patients, and/or as therapeutic agents during the acute phase of infection. An additional advantage of the antibody-driven approach is that mAbs can be instrumental in identifying the optimal vaccine antigen for which mAb binding can block virus transmission.\n\nThis identification step can be done by immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. In addition, once identified, both the antigen and the mAb can be used for structural vaccinology. The latter approach aims at elucidating the atomic structures of the viral antigens with a neutralizing Fab (Fig. 5). Structural vaccinology is a valuable source of information to engineer antigens for stabilization purposes. The combination of antibody-driven and structure-based antigen design strategies is particularly efficient in developing rapid responses to emerging infectious disease threats.\n\nFacilitated by the improvements in high-throughput B cell technologies",

            "text": "Vaccines have been the single most significant advancement in public health, preventing morbidity and mortality in millions of people annually. Vaccine development has traditionally focused on whole organism vaccines, either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. While successful for many different infectious diseases whole organisms are expensive to produce, require culture of the infectious agent, and have the potential to cause vaccine associated disease in hosts. With advancing technology and a desire to develop safe, cost effective vaccine candidates, the field began to focus on the development of recombinantly expressed antigens known as subunit vaccines. While more tolerable, subunit vaccines tend to be less immunogenic. Attempts have been made to increase immunogenicity with the addition of adjuvants, either immunostimulatory molecules or an antigen delivery system that increases immune responses to vaccines. An area of extreme interest has been the application of nanotechnology to vaccine development, which allows for antigens to be expressed on a particulate delivery system. One of the most exciting examples of nanovaccines are rationally designed protein nanoparticles. These nanoparticles use some of the basic tenants of structural biology, biophysical chemistry, and vaccinology to develop protective, safe, and easily manufactured vaccines. Rationally developed nanoparticle vaccines are one of the most promising candidates for the future of vaccine development.\n\n\u00d3 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "text": "This achievement of 4CMenB shows that the section of antigen process can be applied to all bacteria pathogens that shows antimicrobial resistance. The only condition for reverse vaccinology is the availability of the organism's whole genome sequence. In regards to the onset of reverse vaccinology, the genome sequences of anenormous number of isolates may be analyzed for homology. The whole genome sequence is necessary for the forecast of surface proteins and epitopes; which is the significant element of reverse vaccinology for the development of an effective vaccine. This implies that reverse vaccinology is beneficial for the development of epitope vaccines to combat pathogen resistance. 27 Maryam and co-workers carried out an insilico study on novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with its recent outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019 using a reverse vaccinology approach to design an up to standard candidate vaccine against COVID-19, by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology. The result shows that the candidate vaccine can stimulate both the cellular and anitibody-mediated immunity, considering the fact that B-cell and T-cell epitopes have been chosen in the final model. 28 \n\n(b) Structural vaccinology: Since it is possible to carry out isolation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and being able to figure out the structure of antigen-antibody complexes, reveal a new promising area in which information of structure can be used in enhanced antigen engineering. 29 McLellan and co-workers 30 reported that this technology in its early stage has given birth to vast changed antigen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by making stable the RSV's F protein in perfusion conformation. This task was not possible when ordinary technology was being used. In the improvement of HIV outlook, similar process is being used and also to produce general vaccines for influenza. Human mAbs have been crucial step to reveal novel protective antigens e.g. CMV pentameric complex, 31 and the RSVF protein perfusion conformation. 30 Despite the target of most antigen application design is viral pathogens, the technology is also applicable to bacteria, giving room for novel bacteria antigens to be identified with enhanced security within strains of bacteria.",

Recombinant protein subunit vaccines avoid potential issues with purified macromolecule subunit vaccines, including co-purification of undesired contaminants or reversal of toxoids to toxigenic forms and interference between multivalent formulation components [141][142][143]. Thus, recombinant DNA technology has been proposed for expressing orthohantavirus proteins for hantavirus subunit vaccine development [144,145]. Recombinant DOBV nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) in mice induced a strong NP-specific IgG response and mixed Th1/Th2cell involvement [146]. DOBV rNPs conjugated with recombinant rP40 (the Klebsiella pneumoniae outer membrane protein A) showed higher NP-specific antibody responses. Immunogenicity of PUUV rNP-rP40 was characterized [147]. Recombinant PUUV proteins were expressed in E. coli 200. The truncated construct, P40-Puu118, gave high antibody titers after two doses and 100% protection after three doses, suggesting potential as a subunit vaccine against PUUV [148]. \n\nRecent years have witnessed significant advancements in both immune protection technology and bioinformatics, particularly high-throughput sequencing technology, accelerating the development of multi-epitope subunit vaccines through the reverse-vaccinology approach. In 2022, Ismail screened 340 epitopes from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR), identifying 10 epitopes for potential inclusion in a potent multiantigenic epitope subunit vaccine. These epitopes were linked through specific GPGPG linkers to create a computationally designed vaccine [149]. This vaccine was then computationally combined with three different adjuvants to stimulate immune responses. A major limitation of that study is the lack of experimental validation.",

This was successfully used in developing a vaccine against meningococcus B, which, till then, was difficult to be achieved using conventional vaccine technologies (Rappuolia et al., 2021); Structural vaccinology (structurebased antigen design) which can also be considered as a variant of reverse vaccinology uses information on the structure of antigenic epitopes and protein conformation in the design of vaccines. Some examples include the design of a single meningococcal antigen containing the epitopes of three antigenic variants of the same molecule, and a host of others (reviewed by Rappuolia et al., 2021). The stages involved in traditional vaccine discovery and development are shown in Figure 1.\n\nStructural vaccinology is novel and innovative and particularly potentially very useful in antiviral vaccine development to combat very challenging viruses that traditional approaches have failed or may fail to produce effective vaccines. Essentially, the process involves four stages: determining the atomic structure of the antigen or antigenantibody complex; remodeling the antigen or the epitope by reverse molecular engineering; incorporating the re-engineered antigen or epitope into one of the vaccine platforms; and testing the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine in vivo (Anasir and Poh 2019).\n\nIn summarizing, three broad platforms can be used for the design of vaccines: the whole organism (virus or bacterium), the parts of the organism (subunits and recombinants), and the genetic material (DNA or RNA). These are illustrated in Figure 2.",

Then, Scientific progress has driven vaccine development from live attenuated and inactivated vaccines to purified recombinant one. The recent advances in bioinformatics, proteomics, immunoinformatics, structural biology and others have led to vaccinomics and reverse vaccinology as novel approaches for a generation of new vaccines [3].

The recombinant subunit vaccine tends to have good safety and stability. However, because exogenous proteins usually show MHC class II responses and generally do not produce strong T cell responses, adjuvant stimulation and multiple vaccinations are required to enhance immunogenicity, and this may not be suitable for respiratory mucosal immunization. The currently licensed human recombinant subunit protein vaccines include influenza vaccine (FluBlok), herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix), meningococcal serogroup B (Trumenba, Bexsero) vaccine, and COVID-19 vaccine (ZF2001, Nuvaxovid) ( Table 1).\n\nIn recent years, with the advances in theories and technologies in reverse vaccinology, structural biology, genomics, and proteomics, recombinant subunit vaccine immunogens have gradually moved towards a new stage of rational design. The process of reverse vaccinology is developing vaccines using a bottom-up approach from the genome to the vaccine. The MenB vaccine (Bexsero), approved in 2013, is a classic case of reverse vaccinology (Pizza et al., 2000). It is based on whole-genome prediction and screening of critical protective or virulent antigens of pathogenic microorganisms followed by the development of new vaccines; such examples include three antigens: Neisseria heparin binding antigen (NHBA), factor H binding protein (fHbp), and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA). Shingrix, a recombinant subunit adjuvant vaccine developed by Glax-oSmithKline, is composed of the glycoprotein gE recombinant protein of varicella-zoster virus supplemented with a new adjuvant, AS01 B . Overall vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster was 97.2% in older adults (\u226550 years of age) (Lal et al., 2015). The success of Shingrix emphasizes the vital role of",

Furthermore, long-lasting humoral responses against different pathogens can be analysed for diagnostics, understanding pathogenic mechanisms and for the development of vaccines against bacteria, protozoa and viruses (Zhou et al. 2015;Kempsell et al. 2015;Felgner et al. 2009;Vigil et al. 2011;Crompton et al. 2010;Duke-Cohan et al. 2009;Fernandez et al. 2011). Despite several advantages, some of the limitations with protein microarray are (1) non-recognition of misfolded or multimeric proteins (2) requirement of additional procedures for identification of PTMs or non-protein antigens (3) requirement of expensive fluorescent microarray scanner and sophisticated statistical methods (4) requirement of expensive robotics for printing arrays. Antibody microarray was found to be the most versatile multiplexed immunoassay technology that was used for the exploratory detection and study of protein abundance, function pathways, and potential vaccine /drug targets. Applications of antibody microarray in basic biology and clinical studies have been recently detailed out providing insights into the current trends and future of protein analysis (Chen et al. 2018).\n\nApart from application of omics-based tools and reverse vaccinology, development of nucleic acid based vaccines have gained attention in last three decades. It combines the positive aspects of live-attenuated vaccines, viral vectors and subunit vaccines. Nucleic acid based vaccines include viral vectors, plasmid DNA (pDNA) and RNA. These vaccines have their own advantages such as (1) induction of both B and T-cell responses; (2) specificity; (3) high stability; (4) economical; (5) no anti-vector immunity. Published research reports show faster progress in nucleic acid based vaccine development against viruses in comparison to bacterial pathogens.

The principle of vaccine design lies in mimicking specific antigenic components of pathogens to induce an immune response in the host against the pathogen, thus providing protection upon future exposure to the same pathogen. In the design process, selecting appropriate vaccine antigens and adjuvants is crucial as it helps optimize the formation and persistence of immune memory [86]. The application of nanotechnology in vaccine design demonstrates significant advantages, particularly in enhancing immune responses through the presentation of multivalent antigens [87]. Furthermore, the utilization of immunoinformatics tools has further enhanced the efficiency and precision of vaccine design, enabling the development of multi-epitope vaccines [88]. Reverse vaccinology approaches utilize genomic information to predict all antigens of a pathogen, enabling the identification of potential vaccine candidates through computer-based analysis, without the need for culturing the pathogen, thus facilitating vaccine development [89]. Research on the novel tuberculosis vaccine MP3RT demonstrates high concordance between immunoinformatics predictions and animal experimental results, validating the potential application of this technology in reverse vaccinology [90]. Structure-based vaccine design involves the identification and redesign of antigenic epitopes by determining the three-dimensional structure of antigens or antigen-antibody complexes, aiming to enhance vaccine stability and immunogenicity [91,92]. However, vaccine design also needs to consider individual variations to ensure the efficacy and safety of vaccines across diverse populations [93].",

Please note that some exceptions may contradict this generalized comparisons and the first trials in the 1980s focused on the recombinant structural proteins of specific pathogens (Lasky et al. 1986;Hollingdale et al. 1987;van Wyke Coelingh et al. 1987). The knowledge of the biology of the pathogen, the main proteins involved in pathogenesis and highly conserved ones, and the immune mechanisms that should be elicited for protection and identification of protective antigens has enabled a rational design of the recombinant protein vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines are subunit vaccines that use only a small part of the pathogen and target immune response focused against few protective antigens. Thus, the composition of this type of vaccine can be well-defined and controlled. Since a single protein cannot replicate, the risk of having side effects is negligible (Nascimento and Leite 2012). That is the main advantage of using a single protein as a vaccine. However, there is a dark side to this concept. If applied alone, an antigen cannot provide an intrinsic \"danger signal\", and the vaccine will not elicit an adequate and longterm immunity (Bomford 1998;Beverley 2002). To elicit a vigorous immune response, a recombinant protein vaccine requires adjuvants, and often multiple doses are needed as well (Hansson et al. 2000). So, making an efficient recombinant protein vaccine can be a challenge (Table 1). Nowadays, there are various expression systems, each with its advantages and flaws, allowing the production of large-scale quantities of recombinant proteins. Which of the systems will be used depends on the desirable properties of the recombinant proteins as antigens: post-translational modifications, native",

            "text": "\u221222 There are mainly two approaches to vaccine development\ufffd the traditional and reverse vaccinology approaches. A traditional or conventional approach to vaccine development is strictly driven by Pasteur's rules of vaccine development which involves isolation, inactivation, and injection of the subject pathogen that causes the disease to a host. 23 This approach requires the culture of pathogens in order to achieve its isolation and subsequent vaccine development steps. However, not all pathogens can be cultured. For example, the causative agent of hepatitis B was found to be nonculturable, eventually necessitating inactivation and isolation of viral antigen present in the plasma of chronically infected patients. 24 Vaccine development is in itself a complex, expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming process including both the preclinical and clinical phases. Fortunately, with the recent advent of computational methods and immunoinformatics, a reverse vaccinology approach can be utilized for in-silico screening, validation, and evaluation of potential vaccine candidates, reducing the time required for overall vaccine development. 25,26 This approach eliminates the need to propagate and isolate the pathogens while facilitating identification of a large array of potential vaccine candidates that can be assembled as multivalent or multiepitope peptide-based or subunit vaccines. 27 Subunit vaccines constitute antigenic fragments of the pathogen in the form of a purified protein, recombinant protein, polysaccharide, or peptide that are capable of eliciting an immune response. Subunit vaccines encompass easy production and are relatively more safe than whole virus vaccines. However, they may exhibit low immunogenicity which can be overcome by the use of adjuvants and fusion with immunostimulatory molecules. 28 everal types of vaccines and their advantages and disadvantages have been summarized in Table 2. 29 A reverse vaccinology approach has been used to map antigenic epitopes of rotavirus and in-silico subunit vaccine design in the past few years. This review will briefly discuss a general overview of in-silico vaccine development with the main focus on the advances made in in-silico rotavirus vaccine design by the immunoinformatics approach.",

Selection of antigen mimetics recognized by well-characterized bn-mAb such as VRC01 could lead to the identification of protein variants able to induce antibodies of the same specificity as an original antibody with a well detectable neutralization activity. Thus, within the field of reverse vaccinology, this approach represents a viable route for the development of improved vaccination strategies preventing infections such as HIV-1.",

            "text": "In comparison with conventional approaches which require a laborious process of attenuation or inactivation of pathogens, or selection of individual components important for induction of immune response, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility of using genomic information derived from in silico analyses for direct design and production of protective antigen using recombinant technology. This approach can signifi cantly reduce the time necessary for the identifi cation of antigens for development of candidate vaccine and enables systematic identifi cation of all potential antigens even from pathogens which are diffi cult or currently impossible to culture. Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach. Nevertheless, once the protective antigen is identifi ed it enables scientists to systemically classify such antigens, and develop efficient preparations virtually against any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined. \n\nSubunit vaccines offer superior safety profi les and can be manufactured with minimal risk of contamination [ 4 , 5 ]. When coupled with appropriate adjuvants, they can also focus the immune response on protective or highly conserved antigenic determinants that may not elicit a potent response during natural infection or after vaccination with an inactivated or attenuated pathogen [ 6 , 7 ]. \n\nA common observation from the process of elicitation of the adaptive immune response is that the antigen by itself is not a stimulating agent. In other words, administration of absolutely pure recombinant protein antigens and synthetic peptide antigens generally does not induce specifi c immune response. Therefore there is a need for potent co-stimulation by coadministration of appropriate adjuvants, biocompatible carrier systems and application devices for vaccines consisting of highly purifi ed antigens. These particulate systems are supposed to mediate effi cient delivery to antigen-presenting cells and may induce infl ammation through activation of innate immunity [ 8 -10 ].",

            "text": "Classical vaccine development approaches concentrate on the administration of antigens, which are ideally very immunogenic, in order to induce a specific and hopefully long-lasting immune response and therefore protection against the pathogen. With many vaccines, however, the duration of protection is often limited to only a few years at most. Additionally, in order to prolong protection, adjuvants are needed for the enhancement of the immune response. Furthermore, vaccines need to be boosted over the years in order to maintain protection. Classical vaccines are often developed against 'easy pathogens' based on the use of the structural proteins of those pathogens, which are known for high immunogenicity. However, the challenges of modern vaccine development lie more with pathogens that hide from the immune system, or which change and mutate constantly, such as HIV, Malaria, and Ebola, etc. [204]. In order to gather more potential immunomodulatory protein candidates, a novel process-reverse vaccinology-was developed 20 years ago. Whole virus and bacteria genomes are scanned, and immunological epitopes are predicted. Furthermore, conserved epitopes in core proteins are predicted to develop vaccines against many related strains of pathogens [205,206]. One example for reverse vaccinology is the development of a vaccine candidate against Ebola. With epitope prediction tools, proteins containing epitopes which present to human leukocyte antigen molecules and induce IFN\u03b3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found [207]. In the last decade, a new discipline came into focus: systems vaccinology. It combines reverse vaccinology, which studies the role of immunogens, with additional factors like adjuvants and antigen delivery. With certain data-sets gained from systems-based studies, mainly by -omics techniques, it is possible to develop better vaccines based on improved insight into the immune response induced by the vaccine candidate, and to detect correlates of protection [204].",

            "text": "In its simplest form, a vaccine is made from killed pathogen injected directly into a person, spurring the production of antibodies against the exposed antigens on the pathogen's surface. Unfortunately, a microbe's surfaceexposed antigens are often ineffective in eliciting protective immunity. In a refinement of this technique, vaccinologists have purified protein subunits of their targets and injected these subunits into laboratory animals or even human volunteers to try to identify the best antigens. In the 1980s, the application of genetic engineering also allowed the first recombinant subunit vaccines to be produced, circumventing the problem of contamination by blood components or products. Results have been mixed. For many pathogens, the most antigenic proteins may be expressed at very low levels, complicating identification and purification, or the purification procedure may destroy the antigen's structure. \n\nIn another traditional technique, first pioneered by Albert Sabin in the 1950s, a pathogen is repeatedly passed through different tissue culture and animal hosts until its virulence is bred out. Though Sabin's polio vaccine is the cornerstone of the World Health Organization's (WHO; Geneva) campaign to eradicate that disease, attenuated vaccines for other diseases have been difficult to develop and deliver. One common problem is that live vaccines can sometimes mutate back to virulent forms, causing the very disease they were supposed to prevent. \n\nThe advent of whole genome sequencing, however, has led some vaccine researchers to pursue 'reverse vaccinology.' Instead of starting with the whole organism, this approach begins with the genome sequence of a pathogen. Researchers then compare the sequence with the sequences of known antigens and toxins to identify likely vaccine antigens, then use recombinant expression systems to express candidate genes. A series of screens and animal tests identifies the most immunogenic products, which can then form the basis of an experimental vaccine. \n\nChiron Vaccines (Oxford, UK), which coined the term 'reverse vaccinology,' has already demonstrated the method's potential. The company has a conjugated subunit vaccine that targets type C meningococcal disease, which is caused by Neisseria meningitidis.",

This approach works remarkably well in rodent models of disease and may be a very promising approach to control VL where this is fueled by a zoonotic cycle.\n\nFor human use, subunit vaccines based on selected parasite antigens, however, would offer a more defined and more stable alternative (20). But, major obstacles to their successful development exist and these are on the one hand the identification of the most effective antigens and on the other hand their formulation. Formulation relates to selecting adjuvants and/or delivery systems such as recombinant viruses (2,21,22) or bacteria (23,24) and exploitation or engineering of immune-modulating agents and properties to induce protective antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Although our understanding of what makes a protective response in humans remains sketchy (8,9,25), there is no reason to object to the idea that this can be achieved through vaccine formulation if selected Leishmania-antigens were fit for purpose.\n\nIn the post-genomic era, the approach to antigen selection and vaccine development has been revolutionized. The term reverse vaccinology has been coined by Rappuoli and colleagues (26) at the turn of the millennium to designate the process. The idea is simple and is about exploiting genomic and other -omics data sets to filter out relevant gene products in silico. Selection proceeds through an algorithm that is developed \"backwards\" starting from a known or anticipated mode of action of the vaccine. This has been impressively successful for the development of novel anti-Meningococcal Serotype B vaccines because (a) the mode of action was known and allowed to develop a straight forward in vitro screening assay based on lysis-mediating antibodies and (b) this assay was scalable and had high throughput capacity (26,27). The Reverse Vaccinology approach has also been adapted to identify potential vaccine protein antigens against leishmaniasis and the combined search terms \"reverse vaccinology\" and \"leishmania\" retrieve five publications from PubMed as of March 10th 2014 (24,(28)(29)(30)(31)(32).

            "text": "Vaccination is used as a powerful strategy for prevention and even eradication of infectious diseases. Vaccination is promising in eradicating many diseases worldwide, viz., small pox and polio, successfully and, thus, could be used to restrain AMR bacteria especially having wide impact on human and animal health. The application of vaccines as a valid alternative therapeutic to antibiotics has attracted much attention due to the fact that resistance is not observed against vaccines, because of its characteristic features and mechanism of action (80). Recombinant vaccines generally possess multiple immunogenic epitopes, thereby requiring multiple mutations for allowing resistance development and single mutation vaccines are not acceptable clinically. Vaccines developed though recombinant methods restrict bacterial replication, prevent selection of variants, and overcome selection pressure in environment (Figure 5). Vaccines are biotic preparations that develop acquired immunity against a selective organism/target (Figure 4) (81)(82)(83). In general, vaccines falls under three categories, viz., killed/inactivated vaccines (antigens with adjuvants); live/attenuated vaccines (live vaccines), and recombinant vaccines (subunit antigens or genetically engineered organisms). In veterinary practice, multivalent/ multicomponent vaccine approach has been mostly explored. Veterinary vaccines are ideal candidate for animal health and welfare and for food production as they help in preventing the infection; reducing consumption of antimicrobial drugs; enhancing food productivity; and mitigating the impacts of antibiotic resistance. Vaccination too lessens the transmission of zoonotic and foodborne infections to humans (49,84). \n\nKeeping in mind the utility of vaccines over antibiotics, R&D is being undertaken to produce advanced vaccines through recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant veterinary vaccines are classified into three groups, i.e., DNA or RNA vaccines, subunit recombinant vaccines, and vectored vaccines. Recombinant vaccine development involves cloning of DNA fragment into a vector. Recombinant DNA or RNA vaccines results in expression of pathogen specific proteins, while, in subunit vaccines a recombinant protein is generated in laboratory and injected into the host.",

            "text": "Conventional vaccines are developed by the attenuation or inactivation of pathogens. The antigenic part in the pathogens is responsible for inducing host immune response against pathogens and developing sufficient immunity against the pathogenic antigen is the superior goal for vaccine development. The success of vaccines primarily depends on the ability of antigens producing antibodymediated immunity whereas, managing cell-mediated immunity is important against intracellular organisms [1]. The choice of antigens is determined by their immunological efficacy and safety with or without the use of adjuvants [2]. Whereas the vaccine antigen intricacy may vary based on the state like the whole pathogen either inactivated, attenuated and split/subunit. Due to safety reasons, vaccines based on whole pathogens are being replaced by subunit and recombinant antigens and in this context, protein antigens and their epitopes are produced by the recombinant DNA technologies which make use of DNA sequence coding for the antigenic protein of the pathogen [3]. In view of the fact that antigens obtained abundantly not necessarily be the good vaccine candidates [4]. In order to improve vaccine efficacy, rational preclinical development of recombinant antigens and improved protocols for predicting the immunogenicity of antigens is an important endeavour. The efficacy of majority of the vaccine candidates prepared from purified recombinant antigens and peptides depends on the antigens alone, the success of subunit vaccines also depends on the adjuvants added to vaccine formulations to boost the immune response to the antigen [5,6]. Undoubtedly, investigation of the effect of dose of antigens on murine models before vaccine development is an important goal. Immunization protocols in mice models will integrate the biological complexities of the immune system and gives a maximum prediction of the efficacy as well as adverse effects [7]. In the present study, we have explored three recombinant antigens (HBsAg, JEV and DENV) for dose optimization required for screening the novel vaccine adjuvants or delivery systems.",

Reverse vaccinology, combined with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, is driving the development of innovative multiepitope vaccines and antivirals. Strategies such as passive immunization, single\u2010chain antibodies, immunobiotics, and novel antivirals are also explored as alternative management options. The review also underscores advanced genome editing and reverse genetics approaches to improve vaccine design and antiviral therapies.

            "text": "Since the advance in recombinant DNA technology several approaches have been used or proposed to produce new vaccines, but in actuality few have been authorized for use in the United States or elsewhere in the world. The following technologies have been used to develop commercial products: deletion mutants, vectored vaccines expressing antigens to different pathogens, subunit vaccines including virus-like particles (VLP), and DNA vaccines. The basic science on which these vaccines are based is briefly discussed in this section. More detailed information can be found in several review papers and the actual use in production animals is discussed in the four sections on vaccination in production animals. Many of the biotechnology-based vaccines can be used in DIVA strategies, and specific tests to differentiate between vaccine responses and pathogen infection are an integral part of the development of these vaccines. Tests include ELISAs as well as PCR-based assays. The former confirms the absence of antibodies against the deleted gene products after vaccination, although these antibodies are present after infection with the field strains of the pathogen. In the case of AIV, recombinant vaccines produce antibodies to the neuraminidase protein that is different from the field virus. PCR-based assays can also be used as in the case with the gE deletion mutant of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). In this test, a gE DNA fragment is amplified and analyzed by restriction enzymes (Schynts et al., 1999). With the advance in new sequencing techniques, singlenucleotide polymorphism analysis could also be used in this example. \n\nThe possibility of deleting specific genes without significantly altering their immunogenicity was the basis for the first recombinant vaccine licensed in the United States. Deletion of two genes, Tk and glycoprotein III, in suid herpesvirus 1 (aka pseudorabies virus) led to the development of a marker vaccine that was successfully used to eradicate Aujeszky's disease in the commercial swine population in the United States in 2005 (USDA, 2008; Kit, 1990;CAST, 2008). Since then, several deletion and insertion techniques have been developedmostly for herpesviruses and poxviruses but also for RNA viruses.",

A subunit approach is currently in use for multivalent pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccines. In another strategy to develop broad coverage, cross-protective vaccines can use highly conserved protein antigens produced through recombinant technology [140][141][142]. Proper antigens can be selected using bioinformatics analysis of whole-genome sequences and reverse vaccinology [143]. Examples of highly conserved Salmonella protein antigens include flagellin and porins (i.e., OmpC, F, and D). Both recombinant and purified protein vaccine candidates have been tested against conserved protein epitopes [2]. Subunit vaccines can induce both T-cell responses and antibody production; a balanced Th1-Th2 approach is vital to proper clearance of Salmonella. One of the downsides of subunit vaccines developed through recombinant technology is that it is difficult to maintain and preserve the proper conformation of proteins, especially when there are several membrane-spanning domains. This can result in the induction of a poor antibody response. One approach is to purify proteins from whole Salmonella cells rather than relying on recombinant proteins [142].",

            "text": ";Van Regenmortel, 2016). These pitfalls underscore the importance of acquiring new structural and functional insights into humoral immune responses against pathogens. Furthermore, incorporation of multiple structural techniques especially nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is favorable to study the structure and molecular dynamics of antigen-antibody complexes (Moraes et al., 2016). As structural vaccinology is still developing, its application is primarily limited to the design of recombinant protein vaccine, peptide vaccine, and VLPs. These vaccine platforms are associated with low immunogenicity. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate structural vaccinology with other complementary key technologies. For instance, DS-Cav1 protein vaccine could be integrated with the single-round replication recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector to potentially enhance its immunogenicity if required (Johnson et al., 2013). Lastly, a structural vaccinology approach should be extended to improve T-cell responses and not just focus on the B-cell responses to produce better viral vaccines in the future.",

One approach that mines pathogenic bacterial genomes for antigen discovery is known as \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV). RV has emerged as an effective strategy that uses bioinformatics techniques with the aim to identify highly protective and immunogenic peptides encoded by immunologically exposed pathogenicity factors by screening the entire genomes of microbial pathogens (Movahedi and Hampson, 2008;Seib et al., 2012;Donati and Rappuoli, 2013; Figure 2). RV based antigen discovery pipeline involves genome sequence analysis for the identification of antigenic proteins (surface exposed or secreted) expressed by the pathogen, their cloning and expression followed by synthetically producing each FIGURE 2 | Reverse Vaccinology approach: A schematic representation of vaccine development by RV is illustrated in the presented flowchart. RV starts with the computational analysis of the complete genome sequence of the targeted pathogenic organism. Computational predictions are based on algorithms trained on biological data obtained from experimentally carried out studies. The potential vaccine candidates include surface associated and secretory proteins (SASPs) and virulence factors. These are further evaluated to identify protein candidates with antigenic epitopes for B-cells and T-cells. These proteins are then amplified by PCR and expressed in suitable vectors. The recombinant proteins produced are purified and used for immunogenicity testing in animal models (mice). Based on immune sera screening (FACs, Serum Bactericidal Activity), the recombinant proteins capable of inducing sera bactericidal antibodies are selected. The top candidates enter the pre-clinical stage of vaccine development. After the molecular epidemiological studies, the best candidates are used for clinical trials in adults, adolescents and infants and finally they enter the vaccine formulation process. \n\nprotein. The best selected candidates could be tested in the clinical trials for validating their immunogenicity after in vitro immunogenicity examination in cells and animal models. The identified antigens may be targeted for vaccine discovery. To date, RV has been targeted to devise universal and effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens for which the discovery of vaccines was previously impossible.",

The bioinformatics analysis of genomic data can now readily be used to predict surface proteins, which can then be screened to identify new vaccine antigens [22]. This genome-based approach to vaccine development, coined ''reverse vaccinology'' [23], places an emphasis on identifying and validating the immunoreactivity and protective efficacy of bacterial antigens for use as recombinant vaccines against pathogens of animals and humans using rational deductive methodologies. \n\nSubunit vaccines can be based on recombinant proteins, peptides or polysaccharides that have been shown to contain protective epitopes [1]. An example of a commercially available recombinant subunit vaccine is the Hib vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b. It contains a polysaccharide antigen conjugated to a carrier protein such as tetanus toxoid [24]. Conjugation to protein carriers enables induction of a T cell mediated immune response, even in children under two years of age [25,26]. A second generation acellular Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae subunit vaccine has been developed to include the five recombinant proteins, ApxII, TbpB, CsyL, OmlA(1) and OmlA(2) (PleuroStar APP). The vaccine confers some degree of crossprotection against all A. pleuropneumonia serotypes in pigs [18,27]. \n\nWe have used a range of bioinformatics analyses of the annotated P. multocida Pm70 genome [28] sequence and previously published experimental data to select genes encoding proteins likely to have vaccine potential [20]. Protective antigens are likely to be surface exposed or secreted by the bacteria and therefore accessible to the host immune system. On this basis we chose 71 proteins that were identified as predicted OM-associated or secreted proteins [20] to test for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy.",

            "text": "In the 20th century, pertussis vaccines progressed from crude bacterial preparations to the highly purified antigens used for acellular vaccines. A similar quantum jump in technology allowed the development of subunit vaccines against influenza, Hib and S. pneumoniae, as well as the production of antigens by recombinant DNA techniques (e.g., genetically inactivated PT). Despite the fact that these techniques enable the production of almost any foreseeable antigen, the identification of suitable targets still remained as a main bottleneck for vaccine development [120]. \n\nThe advent of genomics and its exploitation in the vaccinology field have rendered possible the implementation of a systematic and holistic approach for the screening, identification and prioritisation of candidate antigens. This new approach, called \"reverse vaccinology\" [121], does not require cultivation of the original pathogen, thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms. It is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico, which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems. The resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological and/or functional studies to select the most promising candidates (e.g., able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies, capacity to confer protective immunity). Flanking studies are usually carried out, such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains, or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections [122]. \n\nThe time-consuming process in which highly expressed components of an in vitro cultivable organism are identified (one at a time) and separated (different components between them) is one of the disadvantages that reverse vaccinology has solved. The conventional method usually requires 15-20 years to arrive to a clinical trial, whereas reverse vaccinology reduces the process to approximately 5 years. Reverse vaccinology also allows the identification of hundreds of potential candidates in a few days, in comparison with the small number of antigens that conventional approaches have provided after decades of research. Moreover, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility to select potential candidates independent of their expression levels or purification easiness.",

There are many examples using these approaches to develop vaccines but this chapter will focus on the possible genome based approaches to confer vaccine developed immunity against two examples of endo-and ecto-parasites such as malaria and ticks, respectively. tools. The functional potential of these in silico approaches has found its pattern in reverse vaccinology. Reverse vaccinology presents a revolution in both immunology and biotechnology and shows how a biological problem like designing a vaccine could be solved by applying integrating tools. However, reverse vaccinology presents a huge advance compared to the conventional vaccine production protocols. It takes advantage of the growing number of genome sequences available for many organisms. The approach uses computer analysis of the genomic sequence to predict suitable candidate vaccine molecules. Unfortunately, the approach does not provide certain evidence that the selected antigens are either immunogenic or protective. On the contrary, the approach permits the identification of novel protein antigens besides the antigens discovered by the traditional protocols.",

            "text": "Recombinant DNA technology has made important contributions to both human and animal health, especially in the field of vaccinology. This vaccine strategy involves the injection of plasmid DNA encoding an antigen into host cells, where it can undergo translation, activating the CD4+ and CD8+ cells for an enhanced antigen-specific antibody and CTL response. Like the recombinant-vector vaccine, this vaccine technology is advantaged compared to the inactivated-virus and subunit systems, because it allows for the de novo synthesis of the immunogen, over a period of time, within the host cell following the injection of the DNA plasmid. This allows for the antigen presentation in its most native conformation [161,162] and the appropriate expression of both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules [163,164] similar to that in natural virus infection but devoid of risk of reversal to virulence, as with a live virus [165]. The DNA technology facilitates rapid updating by site-directed mutagenesis, which is particularly relevant for influenza vaccines. Messenger RNA-based vaccines work on the same principle and, as this technology has advanced for human applications, including their recent use to combat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it may soon come into veterinary applications. \n\nThe application of DNA technology to EI vaccines has been ongoing experimentally for some time, and it is gradually gaining acceptance as a possible basis for new generation vaccines in horses. In a study by Ault and colleagues, the ability of a recombinant DNA vaccine expressing HA antigen(s) from EIV H3N8 strains, either in a monovalent or multivalent composition, was assessed for its ability to induce protective immune responses against homologous EIV challenge in vaccinated ponies.",

The data from clinical research with poxvirus recombinant vaccines so far demonstrate induction of humoral and cellular HIV antigen-specific immune responses in humans. In many preclinical experiments, varying degree of protection against homologous immunodeficiency virus infection has been found, predominantly depending on the challenge virus/animal model used for evaluation. However, HIV has an extraordinary genetic diversity and the \"Holy Grail\" AIDS vaccine would have to cross-protect against different HIV clades. A major scientific challenge is now to find appropriate antigens or epitopes that elicit a cross-protective immune response. For some time, induction of cellular immunity was the primary focus of HIV vaccine development but the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies is also believed to be indispensable [56]. Concurrently, data from two studies in the macaque model showed that booster vaccinations with oligomeric or native Env proteins enhance Env-binding and virusneutralizing antibody responses primed by recombinant MVA vaccines, and suggest that such antibodies are indeed likely to play a role in vaccineinduced protection [57,58]. Hepatitis C is another global health problem caused by a chronic virus infection that still lacks a preventive vaccine, and substantial efforts are currently dedicated to preclinical research in animal model systems [59]. The immunogenicity of the first poxvirus vector vaccines based on recombinant Canarypox virus and recombinant MVA have been tested in HLA-transgenic mouse models [60,61]. \n\nThe threatening episode of suddenly emerging coronavirus infections in humans causing severe acute respiratory syndromes impressively demonstrated the suitability of recombinant poxvirus vaccines to quickly evaluate candidate vaccines against a previously unknown pathogen [62,63]. Thus, in view of the current struggle to tune-up well established but rather too simple vaccine technologies for preparation against the global threat of an influenza pandemic, it is tempting to look into the possible usefulness of poxvirus vectors for development of more potent third generation influenza virus-specific vaccines.",

            "text": "Modern oral vaccination technologies in aquaculture utilize recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) technology-based recombinant DNA vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, and peptide vaccines. The discovery of the immunogenic component or protein from the pathogen of interest, as well as the validation of its pathogenicity in vivo and in vitro, is the step in the production of a recombinant protein vaccine (Kurath 2008). Purified glycoproteins from IHNV and VHSV, for example, have been utilized as subunit vaccines in fish and proved to be immune-protective, and so recombinant vaccines are frequently employed in aquaculture (Zhao et al. 2019;Malick et al. 2020). Once the microbial immunogenic proteins or subunits have been determined, the gene(s) responsible for their production can be inserted into a vector and overexpressed in expression systems and utilized as recombinant protein vaccinations. Peptide vaccines are made up of synthetic peptides that, when administered to the host, can trigger a protective immune response. By developing methodologies that are easily adaptable to a variety of farmed species, the synthetic peptides promise to aid future oral vaccine formulation.\n\nFurthermore, peptide-based vaccinations are safer than traditional techniques, and the fish have less adverse effects. Because the modified (synthetic, recombinant, and/or highly purified) antigenic components of the vaccine lack immunogenicity by themselves, and may require multiple booster immunizations to ensure long-term protective immunity, many subunit vaccines rely on effective adjuvants to elicit the appropriate immunity (Bergmann-Leitner and Leitner 2014). To create a novel multi-epitope subunit oral vaccination against infections, reverse vaccinology was also used. The European Medical Agency and other authorities approved a four-component, protein-based subunit vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B based on this method (Ma et al. 2019). Vaccines for infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) proteins, and virus-like particles (VLPs) formulated with E. coli expression system are among the other recombina",

            "text": "This workshop highlighted emerging antigen and antibody technologies which together form an integrated pipeline to accelerate discovery of novel antigens and the subsequent development of enteric vaccines and immunoprophylactics. The first speaker, Joe Campo, described the use of high-density antigen arrays consisting of proteins, polysaccharides, and even cell lysates to profile multi-isotype antibodies from serum and other sample types, such as breast milk, lymphocyte supernatants, and fecal extracts [16,17]. The high-density arrays were able to identify antibody reactivity profiles associated with age, natural infection, vaccination, adjuvants and, in some cases, the elicitation of on-target and off-target responses [18]. One important takeaway was that antigen-specific IgA and IgG responses vary within and among populations so much that a single type of response (e.g., anti-protein or anti-LPS) may be insufficient to distinguish between protected and susceptible disease status, underscoring the need for broader immune profiling and account for different cohort make-up when defining correlates of protection and anticipated impact of vaccines on disease incidence. \n\nAs a complementary approach to antigen discovery, Omar Rossi (GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health) described advances in reverse vaccinology. In its original iteration, Reverse Vaccinology (RV) involved computational mining of a pathogen's genome for putative vaccine antigens based on the propensity of a given open reading frame to encode for surface-exposed, secreted, and/or virulence factors. Dr. Rossi described a new era of reverse vaccinology (RV2.0) driven by highthroughput screening of human monoclonal antibodies (huMAbs) from vaccinated or convalescent individuals or controlled human infection model (CHIM) subjects for reactivity with a desired target antigen or with in vitro functional activity (e.g., bactericidal). When coupled with high-resolution epitope mapping methodologies and in vitro functional assays, he explained how the characterization of large panels of huMAbs can uncover conformational and broadly cross-reactive epitopes that may serve as basis of vaccine antigens.",

            "text": "Although this approach has been successful in many cases, it is time-consuming and fails when the pathogen cannot be cultured in vitro or when the sequence of the candidate antigen is variable. Currently used bioinformatic algorithms allow us to retrieve gene sequences from public databases, predict antigens and their physicochemical properties, three-dimensional structure, and allergenicity, regardless of their abundance and immunogenicity, furthermore, there is no need to culture the pathogen in vitro [14]. This facilitates vaccine development using non-conventional antigens or linear B or T cell epitopes predicted in silico. Since the process of vaccine discovery starts in silico by using the genomic information deposited in databases rather than the pathogen itself, many vaccines impossible to develop will become a reality. This novel process has been named \"reverse vaccinology\", and is based on the increasing availability of public genome sequence databases (Figure 1). Its use has led to the development and application of technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics, and structural genomics. Antigen candidates identified from a pathogen genome or proteome, can then be expressed as a recombinant protein and tested in an appropriate in vitro or in vivo model to predict and assess immunogenicity and protection. \n\nIn the omic era, vaccines have had a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology is taking advantage of new technologies to develop vaccines that have not succeeded, since most of the existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which depended on the empirical detection of few candidates at a time, depending on the known characteristics of the pathogen [15]. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. Genomics has catalyzed a shift from a traditional vaccinology approach to a sequence-based \"reverse vaccinology\" development, using high-throughput in silico screening of public whole-genome databases in combination with bioinformatics algorithms, resulting in a great tool to identify protein-coding genes with most of the attributes of a good vaccine candidate (Figure 1) [15].",

            "text": "novel vaccine candidate antigens.\n\nPreclinical vaccine development methods are enriched by detailed analysis of the human immune response to etiological agents of infectious diseases. For example, with the development of high-throughput technologies, deep sequencing of the gene segments encoding the variable regions of antibody heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chains in a given B cell repertoire is providing valuable information useful in understanding adaptive immunity to infections, autoimmunity, and malignancies (24,25). Identifying the targets of antibodies of interest by cloning and in vitro expression of VH and VL chains of B-cell antibodies is a powerful approach, which can be utilized to inform on the functional immunogenicity of both known and novel antigens. The use of this approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (26), in the cloning of neutralizing human recombinant monoclonal antibodies [human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs)] from patients convalescing from viral infectious diseases is well documented; the first studies in the use of reverse vaccinology 2.0 focused on the isolation and functional characterization of antibodies targeting the dengue, HIV, and influenza viruses (27)(28)(29). The power of the approach lies in the expression of paired VH and VL regions from individual plasmablasts or memory B cells; the output being the expression of hmAbs mimicking natural VH + VL combinations induced in the host.\n\nBecause of the transience of peak plasmablast circulation [reviewed in Ref. (30)] and the higher incidence of IMD among infants and toddlers (placing a limitation on blood sample volume), we aimed to assess whether reverse vaccinology 2.0 could be employed in the discovery of novel meningococcal antigens of vaccine potential. In this brief research report, we will outline findings relating to the following aims: (i) whether cross-reactive antimeningococcal hmAbs targeting surface proteins could be cloned from patient samples; and (ii) if these hmAbs possessed bactericidal activity against a wide panel of strains, specifically those not covered by the protein-based meningococcal vaccines.

            "text": "Future vaccines will be minimalistic in approach by focusing on key parts of the pathogen, such as regions containing epitopes that cover antigenic diversity and, thus, will target immunologically similar subgroups of the human population and multiple pathogen variants. This is evident from the trend observed in evolution of vaccine strategies, which has seen a shift from whole organisms to recombinant proteins, and further towards the ultimate in minimalist vaccinology, the peptide/epitope/multiepitope based vaccines. The minimalist approach is also expected to cover the safety concerns that are associated with the traditional vaccine approach of using whole organism (Sette and Fikes, 2003;Dertzbaugh, 1998). Vectored vaccines, suitable for 'combination immunization' that are produced by recombinant DNA technology and contain multivalent minimal antigens to protect against multiple infections, are considered to be the future of vaccinology (Kutzler and Weiner, 2008). The future will bring increased integration of vaccine research with advances in immunology, molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, informatics, and high-throughput instrumentation, collective defined as the emerging field of \"vaccinomics\", which is hailed to be responsible for the next 'golden age' in vaccinology (Poland et al., 2008). Awareness of the novel technological possibilities in vaccine research is also expected to grow. Future vaccinology will be based on detailed understanding of immune function, optimal stimulation of immune responses (using adjuvants) and precise mapping and rational selection of immune targets (Brusic et al., 2005). To achieve this, vaccine development will routinely be conducted through large-scale functional studies supported by genomics, proteomics, and informatics techniques prior to clinical trials. This will provide an increased range of immune targets for vaccine design. The author expects the emergence of new generation of vaccines to be personalised to both the genetic make-up of the human population and of the disease agents. In summary, vaccinology will experience rapid progress and will eventually deliver benefits to patients from improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.",

In particular, the presentation of vaccine candidates in form of oligomeric NPs or VLPs, mainly pushed by the development of insect-based protein production platforms, has allowed to overcome the moderate immunogenicity of plain subunit vaccines. The multiple and regular antigen presentation at the nanoscale boosts the immune response and increases protection, as well as proper antigen folding promoted by a native-like glycosylation pattern. Oligomerization is achieved not only in insectcell platforms but also in other production systems. The convenient formulation of the vaccine candidates is largely favored by the extension of the catalog of production platform explored for recombinant vaccine production, which include transgenic plants and animals. Despite the enormous success just observed by the application of mRNA technologies in vaccination against COVID-19, recombinant vaccine formulations still have plenty of room for engineering and improvement, and they show potential to overcome some of the limitations posed by genetic vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccine development began in the 18th century with the use of whole microorganisms to generate protective immune responses in humans. However, live attenuated and inactivated whole viral and bacterial vaccines still belong to some of the most successful human vaccines in use today, e.g. oral polio, measles (standalone and in measles/mumps/rubella combination), influenza, typhoid, cholera, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, although there have been recurring problems associated with product contamination, genetic instability, and residual virulence. Although some early vaccines were based upon protein subunits or toxins that could be extracted from bacterial cells (e.g. diphtheria, tetanus, flu, anthrax, and rabies), it was the emergence of the tools of molecular biology that signaled a new era in vaccine development. The stimulation of protective antibody responses is still key to the success of almost all of the preventive vaccines in use today. Rather than using whole microorganisms as vaccines, identifying and producing individual molecular targets of protective antibodies, such as surface proteins or polysaccharide capsules, became an important focus of vaccine research. The challenging problem of identifying suitable surface antigens on bacterial pathogens, able to confer protection, has been approached more recently by applying large-scale genomic and proteomic technologies. Putative surface proteins on bacteria can be identified by bioinformatics, produced as recombinant proteins, and tested immunologically in a high-throughput fashion for their ability to elicit protective immune responses, an empirical approach that has been termed 'reverse vaccinology' [62][63][64][65]. The success of this approach in identifying protective antigens has now been demonstrated, even in some cases where conventional approaches to vaccine development had failed [66-68]. However, the use of recombinant proteins as vaccines continues to rely on the co-administration of suitable adjuvants to provide a sufficient boost to the immune system, and this remains problematic because of adjuvant toxicity [69]. \n\nOver the past few years, advances in structural biology have led to a dramatic increase in structural knowledge about how antibodies recognize vaccine antigens.",

            "text": "Vaccination is a cornerstone of public health for preventing illness and death due to common infectious diseases. Despite ongoing improvements in global vaccination coverage, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 19.4 million infants still did not receive routine immunizations in 2018 with ~60% of them residing in developing countries. 1 One key approach to enhance access and improve global vaccination rates is to lower vaccine manufacturing costs, while at the same time, expanding production capacity to maintain a consistent supply. 2 Concomitantly, there is a promising trend towards developing new vaccine candidates using recombinant subunit protein antigens designed by reversed vaccinology, 3 which not only offers advantages of improved safety and efficacy, but also enhanced manufacturing scalability and lower costs compared to the traditional approaches (i.e., live, attenuated or inactivated versions of viral or bacterial pathogens). 4 he major cost categories associated with manufacturing such recombinant protein antigens include production facilities and their maintenance, labor, equipment and quality control. 2 Here, we sought to develop a framework to rapidly and cost-efficiently address challenges in developing low-cost formulations of recombinant protein vaccine candidates including using (1) adjuvants to augment immune responses resulting in antigen sparing (i.e., more doses per mg of antigen), 5e7 and (2) preservatives to develop multi-dose presentations (i.e., more doses per vial of vaccine). \n\nOur goal was to design a vaccine formulation developability assessment work-flow to rapidly screen different recombinant protein antigens and formulation conditions using minimal material to identify optimally stable, low-cost vaccine dosage forms targeted for use in low and middle income countries (LMICs). As a proof-ofconcept, we focused on non-replicating rotavirus (NRRV) recombinant protein antigens. The preformulation characterization and formulation development of three different E. coli expressed recombinant NRRV protein antigens (P [8], P [6] and P [4]; see nomenclature below) has been recently described.",

In addition to this, viral vectored vaccines (against Ebola virus), bacterial vectored vaccines, and antigen-presenting cells are more recent approaches. Employing nanotechnology, gene-based assays, next-generation sequencing technologies, and genetic engineering in the process of vaccine development is expected to enhance the revolutionary potential of novel vaccine types [7]. Other emerging, but more precisely relevant, technologies include the integration of multi-omics datasets, single-cell genomics, and epigenomic profiling of immunity, which have created new insights into the cellular and molecular responses that underly both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is also imperative to bring systems vaccinology into the loop in order to achieve our goals. System vaccinology uses metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mass cytometry, coupled with computational approaches, to prepare a global sketch of the complex mechanisms that occur during the development of immune responses against vaccination [8]. Two more important terms, vaccinomics and reverse vaccinology, are used for better outcomes. The former is used to study genomics and data at the system level to find the basis of variations at the individual level in the production of the immune response. The latter term explores genetic sequences to find immunogenic antigens [5,9].",

            "text": "For instance, Goodpasture's invention of methods to propagate viruses in chicken eggs, led to mass production of vaccines including for typhus [5,6]. More recently, use of recombinant DNA technology led to the subunit vaccine for hepatitis B [7]. The ability to engineer synthetic RNA aided the current development of mRNA vaccine approaches [8]. mRNA vaccines encode an antigen of interest for translation in the body where an immune response is generated against it. The first mRNA vaccines approved in history, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been recently approved for SARS-CoV-2. \n\nReverse vaccinology is an application that aids the development of new vaccines, initiated with pathogen genomic sequencing [9,10]. It was first applied successfully to meningococcus B to predict alternative antigens to develop a vaccine [11,12]. After 4 decades of unsuccessful attempts with conventional vaccine design, reverse vaccinology facilitated successful vaccine development through overcoming the challenge of molecular mimicry between the meningococci capsular polysaccharide and human protein [13]. Reverse vaccinology can be used to select an antigen for a novel vaccine which can generate an immune response through epitope selection and screening vaccine candidates in silico, speeding up the process of vaccine design and reducing its cost. An antigen is a molecule capable of producing an immune response, while an epitope is a site on an antigen which is recognised by the immune system. There are two types of epitopes, B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes. B cell epitopes are recognised by antibodies, whereas T cell epitopes are recognised by T cell receptors. The full SARS-CoV-2 genome was released in January 2020 allowing reverse vaccinology approaches to be applied in the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus was spreading around the world. \n\nModern vaccine design aims to maximise efficacy while minimising potential serious adverse effects, such as inducing an allergic reaction or toxic effects causing damage to the organism. To this end, newer approaches have shifted away from early liveattenuated and inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines, towards purified antigens (subunits), as these come with improved safety profile [14].",

This combined prescreening strategy has the great advantage of reducing a large number of protein antigens undergoing animal testing in a genome-based vaccine identification method such as reverse vaccinology (RV) 17 .\n\nThe availability of genome sequences for most of the pathogens has led to the development of a new vaccine design method known as reverse vaccinology. Using this approach, researchers look at the entire genome of the pathogen to identify a novel protective antigen, instead of studying known virulent factors of the pathogen as a vaccine target. Various in silico tools such as Vaxign, NERVE and Rankpep have been employed for reverse vaccinology to identify a potential vaccine target for a number of pathogens 18,19 .",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a genome-based approach for vaccine development that differs to the traditional methods of vaccine design, which utilizes killed or attenuated pathogens such as the measles vaccine [14]. Indeed, the term \"reverse\" refers to the identification of specific genes among the whole pathogen genome to be selected and expressed as recombinant proteins for the implementation of the vaccine. Anyway, among all the proteins, only specific epitopes can be recognized by the host immune system [15,16] and their identification is one the main problems and limitations in vaccine development. In this sense, RV integrates immunological information to rationally select the most attractive antigens for further studies [17]. In this way, it is possible to select proteins that efficiently stimulate the immune response: an essential prerequisite for the development of effective vaccines [18]. \n\nTraditional approaches have limitations that are bypassed by RV. For example, the number of identified antigens, usually limited with biochemical methods, is overcome by RV while taking into account every putative antigen during the preliminary analysis. Another example is the antigen variability among strains and species that RV is able to reduce by selecting the most conserved genome sequences [17]. Finally, costs and speed of vaccine production need to be considered during the design, since they are important limitations for vaccine development and distribution, for example, in the case of an emergency, as evidenced by the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\nNotably, RV is a time-saving approach; it avoids the necessity to grow the pathogens for the analysis in exchange of an often faster production of recombinant proteins. Finally, modern high-throughput computational analysis tools allow the development of powerful vaccines with different antigens against one pathogen, but also broad-spectrum vaccines that exploit the same antigen against different pathogens [18][19][20]. \n\nNevertheless, reverse vaccinology, as well as structural vaccinology, have some limitations. Among these, RV cannot identify carbohydrate-based antigens, which are common protective antigens of pathogens. Another important drawback of RV is that it depends on the genomes of the analyzed organisms and on the software (and equations) utilized.",

The availability of genomic data, the advancements in bioinformatics, technology and computing resources and increased understanding of immune responses and immunogenetics are moving developments away from \"one size fits all\" product prescriptions to one where possibilities of orientation towards individual, community and population specificity can exist in new vaccine design [12]. This is deemed to be of increasing necessity in hyper-variable viruses like coronavirus, influenza, and the like, where traditional vaccines are failing to cope with the changes [12,13]. Rational design of vaccines and the science of \"reverse vaccinology\", as a yet nascent culture, are pointers towards the future of vaccine development. \n\nPeptide vaccines belong to one of these new categories. The idea is to scan the viral genome for the protein antigens that can elicit an immune response and then synthesize them into a peptide vaccine. A more focused approach is to precisely locate the epitope regions within these antigens and utilize them to elicit the immune response [14]. The recent advancements in the technological and bioinformatics fields enable computer-based approaches for this purpose. Peptide vaccines have been in use against animals for some time. The first reported success was with the virulent canine parovirus [15], stimulating development of other peptide vaccines against diseases, such as malaria [16] and classical swine fever virus [17] in animals, and vaccines for humans are in various stages of trials [18]. Recombinant DNA technology and naked DNA have been used to induce immune response against virus infections; synthetic peptide vaccines have been the other approach in peptide vaccinology [19].",

            "text": "The first generation of flavivirus vaccines, such as the yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine, were developed empirically by serially passaging pathogenic virus in animal tissues until attenuated virus variants emerged that were suitable to be used as a safe, live and effective vaccine (1,2). Others, like the licensed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccines are made from whole inactivated viral particles (3,4), a strategy that has been recapitulated for experimental vaccines for other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (5)(6)(7). In recent decades, the advent of a novel suite of technologies has enabled a more rational and targeted approach to the rapid discovery and development of immunogens for emerging pathogens (8,9). In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (10,11). These new technologies were first pioneered through research of viral pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, for which effective vaccines traditionally have been difficult to develop (11)(12)(13). The biology and methodologies elucidated by working on these other viruses have paid dividends for the development of countermeasures to other infectious diseases, particularly flaviviruses, which threaten the health of people throughout the world.",

The vaccine produced in the conventional broad based method does not function properly. Only the vaccine, based on the specific part of the antigen alone will function properly, for which reverse vaccinology, a new method for identification of vaccine candidate, has been proposed. Hence, in the present work, reverse vaccinology has been applied to develop a potential vaccine candidate from the whole antigen. In this technique, instead of whole antigen, a part of the antigen known as T cell epitope, which is recognized by both B cell and T cell mediated immunity, was predicted.",

            "text": "The concept of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in the field of bacterial vaccines by Rappuoli (2001) about 10 years ago. RV does not attempt to develop vaccine candidates by the usual approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and determining which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatics analyses of entire bacterial genomes. In silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the surface-exposed proteins that the pathogen is able to express and these proteins are then produced by high-throughput technologies and tested for their immunoreactivity with patient sera as well as for their ability to induce protective antibodies (Rappuoli and Bagnoli, 2011). This strategy was called \"reverse\" vaccinology because the investigators operate in a so-called reverse manner, i.e., starting from the genome rather than from the organism, to discover which proteins are potential vaccine immunogens. This genome-based strategy has the advantage that hundreds of bacterial proteins are identified as candidate immunogens even if the bacteria cannot be cultivated. \n\nIn virology, RV has a different meaning altogether and refers to the strategy of generating a vaccine from the known crystallographic structure of nMabs bound to viral epitopes. The term \"reverse\" is used metaphorically in the sense that the investigator is trying to generate a vaccine starting from neutralizing antibodies instead of trying to generate such antibodies by immunization (Burton, 2002;Walker and Burton, 2010). It is not clear, however, which vaccine discovery process is being reversed since the bnMab is simply used as a template to reconstruct its epitope outside the context of the natural antigen, using structure-based design technology. The assumption is then made that the reconstructed antigen designed to fit the bnMab will possess the immunogenic capacity of inducing a polyclonal antibody response with the same neutralizing capacity as the Mab. \n\nSince the RV approaches used for developing bacterial and viral vaccines are completely different it would be preferable to call them genome-based and structure-based RV, respectively (Van Regenmortel, 2011b).",

Recombinant vector vaccines use an attenuated bacterium or virus to either multiply and express the antigen within the host or introduce DNA in the host cells (85). Further advancement in genetic engineering and bioinformatics permits the identification and synthesis of epitopes possessing ability to trigger the immune response, resulting in the development of recombinant vaccines. Such recombinant vaccines provide targeted immunity and eliminate the use of attenuated infectious agents, ensure safety, and early onset of immunity (85). These vaccines comprise of minimum of one modified antigen having ability to induce an immune response against targeted pathogens upon co-administration with adjuvants or plasmids (86). \n\nThe first DNA vaccine for veterinary application was licensed in 2005, against the Equine West Nile Virus (87,88). Subunit vaccines, namely Gavac and Tick GUARD, developed by Heber Biotec and Fort Dodge too have been approved for commercial use in cattle against Ripcephalus (Boophilus) microplus. In India, Shakya et al. (89) characterized recombinant Subolesin, having 44 and 37.2% vaccine efficacy against female ticks in crossbred cattle male calves after first and second challenges, respectively. The subolesin ortholog of Hyalomma anatolicum and R. (B) microplus was reported to be highly conserved across different Indian strains, having over 50% of sequence homology at the amino acid level. HIDATIL EG95, a subunit vaccine, is available for protecting sheep and goats against Echinococcus granulosus (85). Leish-Tec is one of the commercially available recombinant vaccines against protozoans (90).

Since then, more sophisticated ideas have revolutionized the field, such as the reverse vaccinology [28] or the next generation technologies (synthetic biology, RNA vaccines, structural vaccinology, adjuvants to human immune response). Dr. Rino Rappuoli (Glaxo Smith Kline, Italy) detailed how the concept of reverse vaccinology (a genome-based approach to identify vaccine candidates) has emerged with the development of the Meningococcus B (4CMenB) vaccine. In summary, the entire bacterial genome of Neisseria meningitidis was investigated to identify vaccine candidates for meningitis. A total of 570 open reading frames were initially found through in silico analysis. Those sequences were amplified and cloned in DNA plasmids for further protein expression. Immunization with 25 of those individual recombinant proteins elicited bactericidal antibodies and were downselected [29]. At the end, 3 potent antigens (two fusion proteins and one single polypeptide -fHbp, NadA and NHBA) were combined with an Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) for the final vaccine formulation (reviewed by [30]).",

This innovative approach relies on the genomic information of the pathogen of interest, namely the list of antigens and epitopes the microorganism is capable of expressing, thus enabling the rapid and fair screening of candidate antigens to be employed for the vaccinal formulation [339]. Reverse vaccinology has led to an efficient vaccine against meningococcal serogroup B; 4CMenB was reported. A similar approach has been pivotal for the selection of antigen candidates for the development of a vaccine against E. coli [340] and P. aeruginosa [341]. \n\nAnother innovative vaccinology strategy is the use of outer membrane vesicles as a vaccine platform. This approach relies on the production of outer membrane-based vesicles from Gram-negative bacteria opportunely modified to reduce lipopolysaccharide-mediated reactogenicity and other unwanted interfering reactions. These serve as safe and potent immunostimulants against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis and Shigella sonnei [342][343][344][345]. \n\nRecently, the generation of antimicrobial glycoconjugate vaccines has been suggested as a simple in vivo strategy to produce vaccines against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This simple strategy relies on the genetic modification of a single strain of E. coli to produce the desired vaccine through oligosaccharyltransferase, PglB. This enzyme catalyzes the linkage of a selected antigenic polysaccharide to target carrier proteins that contain specific N-glycosylation sites.",

            "text": "Structural biology approaches have enabled the determination of the structure of whole viruses, viral proteins, and antigen-antibody complexes Lee and Wilson, 2015;Anasir et al., 2017a,b). The three-dimensional (3D) structures provide crucial insights into the tertiary structure and position of the viral epitopes. Ultimately, the detailed structural information can be exploited to solve some of the challenging problems impeding vaccine development against viruses. Structural vaccinology is a rational approach to generate an effective vaccine that involves (1) determining the atomic structure of the antigen or antigen-antibody complex, (2) remodeling the antigen or the epitope by reverse molecular engineering, (3) incorporating the re-engineered antigen or epitope into one of the vaccine platforms, and (4) testing the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine in vivo (Figure 1).\n\nIn the first step of this approach, the 3D structure of the antigen or antigen-antibody complex will be determined using either one or more of the structural biology tools such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Thereafter, the antigen will be remodeled based on the structural information of the antigen. In addition, the immunological and bioinformatics knowledge should be synergistically combined with the structural insights to design an effective antigen. In most cases, the re-engineering process involves mutations of certain amino acids to stabilize immunogenic conformations, mask unwanted non-neutralizing antibody epitopes, optimize antigen thermostability, or introduce additional epitopes on the antigen. Next, the re-engineered antigen could be incorporated into one of the vaccine platforms such as the recombinant protein vaccine, the viruslike particle vaccine, or the live-attenuated vaccine. Finally, the immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccine should be tested in animal models including mice, ferrets, and macaques. Based on the preclinical findings, the candidate vaccine could be redesigned to improve its immunogenicity and efficacy. Structural vaccinology was shown to be successful in overcoming the challenges facing the bacterial vaccine field. For instance, the 3D structures of H-binding protein of Men B and the pili of group B Streptococcus have facilitated the design of improved vaccines (",

            "text": "Major efforts to improve the approaches for vaccine development are underway. As can be seen from Figure 1, the development of synthetic influenza vaccines is the third platform for influenza vaccine production. Several novel technologies that may improve the production process have been described recently. These technologies could make possible the development of eliciting long-lasting and broadly cross-reactive universal influenza vaccines (UIVs) without the need for eggs [11].\n\nWith the development of plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques [12], it is now possible to engineer recombinant influenza viruses entirely from full-length complementary DNA copies of the viral genome by the transfection of vaccine-approved susceptible cells. The gene synthesis technique combined with reverse genetics approaches allows the generation of IIV and LAIV 6:2 vaccine candidates within short time frames.\n\nRecombinant HA-based protein technology may help to solve many problems associated with the use of chicken embryos, such as the low affinity of current H3N2 viruses to eggs, and the necessity of speeding up the vaccine development process. However, the low immunogenicity of recombinant HA-based subunit vaccines necessitates repeated vaccination and the use of adjuvants.\n\nAn ideal true UIV can induce a cross-protective, broadly neutralizing immune response against conserved viral antigens; offer a combination of protection from antigenic drift/shift; and confer lifelong immunity. It is effective against all influenza A and B virus subtypes/lineages regardless of any mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA). To design this type of vaccine, the highly conserved epitopes present in HA, NA, or M2 and internal proteins should be targeted to induce cross-protective antibodies and T-cells. The development of a UIV can be significantly facilitated by newly developed platform technologies such as multi-epitopes, virus-like particles (VLP), and DNA-and mRNA-based vaccines.\n\nOver 20 different approaches are described as strategies for the development of UIVs, such as HA-targeting vaccines (chimeric, mosaic, and headless HAs, and mosaic nanoparticles), M2-targeting vaccines, internal protein-targeting vaccines, and NA-targeting vaccines. These approaches include recombinant, protein-",

            "text": "Newer vaccine development techniques, such as recombinant DNA technology or viral vector vaccines, may offer advantages in terms of efficacy and safety. Computational vaccinology and in-silico prediction of the host's immune response to pathogens/antigens can expedite the development of novel vaccines. Epitope-based vaccines, which target specific antigenic regions of the pathogen, offer a promising approach to vaccine development termed 'reverse vaccinology' due to their potential for inducing targeted immune responses while minimizing side effects (Rappuoli, 2000). Computational epitope prediction and immuno-informatics can hasten the design and development of multi-epitope vaccines (Pizza et al., 2000;Masignani, Pizza & Moxon, 2019). Molecular docking and molecular simulations aid in understanding the binding potential of in-silico designed vaccine with host immune cell receptors (Rappuoli et al., 2016). Immunoinformatics has been gainfully employed for designing multi-epitope vaccine candidates against KFDV (with a relatively smaller set of genome sequences) and to understand the molecular interactions between the host receptors and virus protein recently (Arumugam & Varamballi, 2021;Dey et al., 2023;Hafeez et al., 2023). The present work is a comprehensive phylogenomic and immunoinformatics analysis of KFDV based on 73 genome sequences to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate based on a major antigenic protein, which is an envelope protein.

In general, the aim of this approach is the identification of genes potentially encoding pathogenicity factors and secreted or membrane-associated proteins. In this context, specific algorithms suitable for the in silico identification of novel surface-exposed and, thus, antibody accessible proteins mediating a protective immune response are used [2]. \n\nPizza and co-workers in collaboration with The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) provided the first example of a successful application of the reverse vaccinology approach [3]. They described that in silico identification of vaccine candidates against Neisseria meningitides serogroup B, which is the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults, could be effective, while conventional approaches to obtain a vaccine had failed for decades. \n\nNew powerful genomic technologies have increased the number of diseases that can be addressed by vaccination, and have reduced the time of discovery research and vaccine development [1]. Nowadays, it costs US$ 200-400 million to research, develop, manufacture and launch a new vaccine on the global market [4]. With the use of reverse vaccinology, time and cost spent on the search of new vaccine targets are significantly reduced. \n\nImmunoinformatics is an emerging application of bioinformatics techniques that focuses on the structure, function, and interactions of the molecules involved in immunity. One of its main goals is the in silico prediction of immunogenicity at epitope level. Recently developed in silico tools and databases can be used to identify, characterize or predict antigen epitopes recognized by T-and B-lymphocytes, cells that play significant roles in infection and protective immunity [5]. \n\nEpitopes are the minimal essential units of information derived from self and nonself proteins that stimulate cellular (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) immune responses.",

            "text": "The clinical implications of developing next-generation vaccines based on reverse vaccinology in clinical practice and the field of biomedicine are significant. While initial findings from preclinical experimental studies have shown promising results in terms of vaccine development and immunogenicity, further research is needed to validate the identified epitopes and evaluate the resulting immune responses in animal models. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed vaccine candidates, challenge studies should be conducted to determine whether immunized animals are protected against lethal infections caused by pathogens such as C. difficile, K. aerogenes, E. hormaechei, and H. alvei. This step is crucial to ensuring the vaccine's efficacy and its potential to combat these specific infections. \n\nUtilizing immunoinformatics to predict the epitopes from the antigenic regions of the respective pathogens is particularly useful for developing multi-epitope-based vaccines that target antibiotic-resistant strains. This approach enables the identification of specific epitopes that can effectively stimulate immune responses against resistant strains. Moreover, conducting a conservancy analysis of specific amino acid sequences is essential in order to include highly conserved epitopes from antigenic regions. These conserved epitopes have the potential to provide broad-spectrum protection against MDR bacteria, which is a critical aspect in combating the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance. In summary, the utilization of reverse vaccinology in the development of next-generation vaccines holds promising clinical implications. Further research involving animal models, challenge studies, and the identification of conserved epitopes would contribute to the validation and potential application of these vaccines to combat antibiotic-resistant infections in clinical practice.",

            "text": "The first vaccines resulted from empirical studies and were mainly composed of whole organisms (live attenuated or killed) or inactivated toxins. The majority of vaccine studies developed later also used conventional approaches to select for appropriate antigens. Antigen selection was a key step in vaccine development in the pre-genomic era but was time-consuming and had many limitations. The properties aimed for in these molecules were: 1) being accessible to the immune system and inducing protective immunity and 2) being conserved within the species and not containing regions of high variability (3). The selection of good candidate vaccine antigens was primarily based on the capacity of induction of protective antibodies, which probably explains why effective vaccines currently available mainly induce a protective humoral immune response (1). More recently, molecular biology methods have been applied to the development of new vaccines, primarily to enable large-scale production of subunit or peptide-based vaccine antigens. Nevertheless, only a small number of available vaccines are based on recombinant antigens.\n\nThe strategies of conventional vaccinology pose limitations for the development of effective vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. The development of vaccines against pathogens that show important antigenic variation or that cannot be cultivated in the laboratory remains a great challenge. Currently, new approaches using high-throughput technologies are being used for the identification of new vaccine candidate molecules (4).\n\nThe publication of the Haemophilus influenzae genome, the first pathogen to have its complete genome sequence published as a result of an approach to genome analysis using new technologies of high-throughput sequencing (5), has opened the mind of scientists to a range of new possible approaches to the study of microorganisms and has marked the beginning of a new era in vaccine development: the identification of pathogen candidate antigens based on the knowledge of the genome of the pathogen and on the understanding of microbial biology and host-pathogen interactions, an approach called reverse vaccinology (6).\n\nThis approach has been favored in recent years by the use of high-throughput technologies in the fields of genomics, proteomics and immunomics, among other \"omics\", which has expanded enormously. The number of available viral and parasitic genome sequences is growing continuously (2), and important advances have been made to make new biostatistics and bioinformatics tools available",

Four of these technologies are briefly described below. \n\nAntigenome technology -The Antigenome approach, proposed by Etz and co-workers, 2 stems from the assumption, experimentally confirmed to be basically true for antibodymediated immunity, that all protective antigens induce antibodies during natural infection. On the basis of that, the genomic DNA of the pathogen of interest is fragmented and the fragments are cloned to create bacterial expression libraries, each clone expressing random portions of the pathogen proteins. Those clones expressing immunogenic proteins are then identified by immunoassays using sera from convalescent patients. Normally, from a bacterial pathogen, 40 to 50 immunogenic proteins are identified and these proteins are subsequently tested in appropriate surrogate-of-protection assays (SoPAs) to select those to be used as vaccines. \n\nGenome (\"Reverse Vaccinology\") technologies -Differently from the previous approach, this technology is completely \"unbiased\" and originates from the indisputable assumption that protective proteins must be encoded by the genetic makeup. Therefore, the genome of the pathogen of interest is sequenced and all annotated proteins are expressed and purified to be finally tested in SoPAs. The approach was conceptualized for the first time by Stephen Johnson and coworkers using DNA immunization, 3 subsequently proposed using protein immunization by L. Lissolo and coworkers (Abstracts WHO Conference 'Utilization of genomic information for tropical disease drug and vaccine discovery', Geneva, 1998; 4 ), and finally demonstrated to be effective by Pizza and coworkers. 5 A Neisseria meningitidis Group B vaccine based on antigens (and Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), see below) selected by Reverse Vaccinology has recently been registered in Europe. 6 One interesting aspect of this approach is that it can also be applied for the identification of antigens that stimulate Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI). 7 roteomic technologies -The main drawback of genome technologies is that several hundreds of recombinant proteins have to be screened in time-consuming and labor intensive assays usually involving animal models.",

The selected recombinant inoviruses that carry mimotopes can then be isolated in order to determine the DNA and amino acid sequence of the displayed oligopeptides. DNA sequencing of such inserts as well as structure prediction analysis can potentially identify the previously unknown target of an antibody. Besides antibody characterization, inoculation of recombinant inoviruses isolated through this approach can potentially be used as vaccine carriers. For example, if a neutralizing antibody against a pathogen is used to screen an RPL, the selected peptides (fused to inoviruses) would mimic the original antibody epitope. Vaccination of animals with these inoviruses could ultimately induce the production of similar antibodies by the vaccinated individual, offering protection from infection against the pathogen. Inovirus display technology has been successfully applied in the development of vaccines against various pathogens (Tables 1 and 2). The potential for inovirus display technology to facilitate the mapping of antibody epitopes is of great importance, especially in the case of HIV-1. Epitopes of broadly neutralizing monoclonal anti-HIV-1 antibodies could be rare, vulnerable spots on the surface of a frequently mutating virus such as HIV-1 and therefore, their identification and further study could lead to new drug therapies or vaccine targets. This review focuses particularly on the applications of inovirus display technology that utilizes capsid proteins gp3 and gp8, as those have been used in vaccine development.",

The antigen that is presented on or delivered through any platform will dictate the specificity of the immune response and largely direct the durability and breadth of immunity. In the early days of the HIV epidemic, vaccine developers took a standard approach in vaccinology, focusing on the wild-type form of the viral surface proteins as the primary immunogens for development. It became clear that the genetic and antigenic variability of HIV, particularly its surface envelope glycoprotein, would preclude this strategy from being a successful one [11]. A more rational approach toward immunogen design eventually took hold, based on the structural resolution of key epitopes that were the target of potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies, which in many viral pathogen models have been a strong correlate of protection.\n\nIn recent years, structural biology and reverse vaccinology have become powerful tools to influence antigen potency. These approaches optimize the immunogenicity of antigens by resolving the structural details of surface proteins as a way to engineer key epitopes as targets of the most potent neutralizing antibodies, particularly those identified after natural infection [12][13][14]. Much of the focus in rational vaccine design for enveloped viruses, like HIV, has been on stabilizing their surface class I fusion proteins in a prefusion conformation. By honing in on this region, vaccine designers have been able to improve the breadth of neutralization [15].\n\nOne application of this HIV vaccine design strategy was in scaffolding epitopes to elicit antibody responses against the membrane proximal external region of the envelope gp41 subunit [16]. In this approach, a broadly neutralizing epitope was positioned, in its native conformation, onto a heterologous protein scaffold. This translated into the stabilization of the envelope ectodomain in its trimeric prefusion conformation and the generation of the BG505 SOSIP.664 proteins that contain the targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies [17,18]. The methods of reverse vaccinology have also been used to understand and improve upon modestly successful vaccine strategies-such as that observed in the seminal RV144 trial and its immune corre",

            "text": "Development of an effective vaccine is of paramount important in disease prevention and control. As such, recombinant technology can serve as a gateway for the development of safe and effective vaccines that can be delivered effectively with an appropriate adjuvant. Therefore, this paper aimed to review the role of recombinant vaccine technology, new adjuvants and the challenge of vaccine delivery. Related peer-reviewed journal article searches were conducted using a subscribed database at the Universiti Putra Malaysia library, involving areas of Health Sciences and Medicine via Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar. New generation vaccines include highly purified synthetic or recombinant antigens that stimulate effective cell-mediated immune and mucosal immunity. In order to enhance their efficacy, a number of adjuvants are used. Efforts have also been made to explore the usage of non-invasive routes of administration, devices and equipment for optimized antigen and immune-potentiator delivery of the immune system. Recombinant vaccine technology is rapid, compared to the traditional method of vaccine development and does not require the handling of live viruses. It is, therefore, a promising technology for developing a future vaccine to curb emerging and re-emerging viral infections that may be life-threatening or teratogenic.",

            "text": "This method allows for incorporating T-cell and B-cell epitopes identified through immunoinformatics tools, enhancing vaccine specificity and effectiveness. By targeting critical immune components, reverse vaccinology complements the work done with MVA and other platforms, ensuring that vaccines elicit robust CD4+ and CD8+ Tcell responses, crucial for recognizing and eliminating infected cells. Additionally, potent B-cell responses lead to the production of neutralizing antibodies, providing long-term immunity. For instance, Bhattacharya et al. (2022) utilized immunoinformatics methods to design a vaccine targeting multiple virus epitopes, optimizing its ability to induce a solid and comprehensive immune response (50). Current vaccine strategies, including those for viral vector-based vaccines, have demonstrated both T-cell and B-cell mediated responses, contributing to their protective efficacy. While this reverse vaccinology approach has not yet been explicitly tested in viral vector-based vaccines, the principles of epitope design could be applied to enhance the effectiveness of such vaccines. Similarly, Ullah et al. ( 51) demonstrated how immunoinformatics analyses can predict vaccine constructs' stability, immunogenicity, and non-allergenicity, which could also be leveraged to improve the formulation of viral vector-based vaccines (51). \n\nIntegrating these approaches accelerates vaccine development and creates safer and more effective vaccines for combating monkeypox and other emerging pathogens. Combining these innovative methods promises to transform the vaccine landscape as we progress, offering more adaptive and targeted strategies to combat viral outbreaks.",

            "text": "Antigen expression is often dependent on growth conditions, and the medium may be very complex. 31 These conditions are difficult to reproduce and regulate in vitro. The combination of transcriptional and proteomic analysis may provide a means to identify key antigens associated with tissue or cellular persistence and potential virulence. Such analyses could provide means to simplify vaccine formulations to include only protective antigens and reduce the presence of nonprotective, potentially interfering bacterial proteins. Not only would this potentially improve efficacy, but it could also improve safety profiles by reducing the antigenic mass in a vaccine dose. \n\nThe continued use of alternative expression systems has many potential advantages. Transgenic expression of protein antigens and plant-based systems may provide access to oral vaccines as well as enhanced stability of antigens. 32 Expression of antigens in avirulent viruses, bacteria, and yeast and insect cells may provide both manufacturing and user safety by eliminating the need to use a virulent or partially virulent microbe to provide immunity. 33 Further development of nucleic acid vaccines may provide even greater formulation simplicity and biosecurity. Viral particles such as capsids from avirulent viruses may serve as building blocks to deliver nucleic acids, protein subunit antigens, and microadjuvants directly to secondary lymphoid tissue. Not only would these biologically engineered vaccines provide targeted immunity and eliminate the need to work with dangerous microbes, they very likely would reduce the time required for the onset of immunity, with excellent safety characteristics. \n\nOne of the most pressing problems associated with manufacturing vaccines is the requirement to rapidly modify antigen formulations as new diseases emerge or as older pathogens mutate and reemerge. Transcriptomics and proteomics combined with established recombinant or synthetic approaches could potentially provide antigens that could be rapidly formulated with approved new-generation adjuvants to produce novel and efficacious vaccines. 31 These technologies are commonplace in experimental laboratories. Using combinations of proteomics, reverse genetics, recombinant or molecular syntheses, and stable, consistent adjuvant platforms will allow development of ''first line of defense'' vaccines for a rapidly emerging disease in a short time. Such a use-inspired approach to vaccines would allow the use of assembly-line techniques to manufacture vaccines.",

            "text": "The reverse vaccinology approach utilizes genetic information on hosts and pathogens for the design of vaccines and does not depend on the pathogen attenuation or its administration. \n\nWith the advent of recombinant DNA technology and progress in genomics and proteomics data, sequence information began to be stored, managed, and accessed from various comprehensive databases. The information on all potential antigens of pathogens could be identified and extracted using the tools of bioinformatics followed by their experimental validation involving expression of the selected antigens in a suitable expression host by recombinant DNA technology and serological studies in a susceptible host. The first successful attempt at designing a vaccine using the reverse vaccinology approach was made against the pathogen Meningococcus serogroup B (Men B), an etiological agent responsible for causing around 50% of global meningococcal meningitis, by Pizza et al. in 2000. 30 Traditional vaccine development against Men B had been unsuccessful due to sequence variation of pathogen-surface-exposed proteins and cross-reactivity between the pathogen capsular polysaccharide and human selfantigen. The reverse vaccinology approach aided and expedited the identification of previously unknown surface proteins capable of inducing antibodies to kill the pathogen in vitro. 30 he term \"reverse vaccinology\" was coined by Rino Rappuoli in the year 2000. 31 Since the successful demonstration of this approach, vaccine design attempts have been made against a plethora of pathogens like Trypanosoma cruzi, 32 Mycoplasma gallisepticum, 33 dengue virus, 34 nipah virus, 35 zika virus, 36 SARS-CoV-2 virus, 37 among numerous others. A crucial step in the design and development of in-silico vaccines is to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes of the pathogenic protein of interest. Epitopes are modules within antigens consisting of short amino acid sequences that are capable of inducing a more direct and potent immune response than that induced by the whole cognate antigenic protein of the pathogen. 38 During infection or vaccination, the pathogenic proteins are processed by the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the host.",

            "text": "Vaccination is one of the most economical and effective ways of preventing and controlling infectious diseases [40,41]. With ongoing breakthroughs, vaccine technology has developed from the Pasteur principle of \"isolation, inactivation, and injection\" of pathogens to modern diverse vaccine strategies based on the integration of genetic engineering, immunology, structural biology, reverse vaccinology, systems biology, and artificial intelligence. A variety of strategies are now available for the development of vaccines against newly identified and re-emerging pathogens, including attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, polysaccharide-protein binding vaccines, multivalent vaccines, virus-like particle vaccines, nanoparticle vaccines, viral vector vaccines, subunit vaccines, polypeptide vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines, and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines [42]. \n\nPolypeptide vaccine is one of these vaccines and is prepared by identifying the amino acid sequence of important epitopes on infec- tious pathogens and synthesizing polypeptides in vitro [9]. Polypeptide vaccine has the advantages of high safety and a broader spectrum, especially considering the involvement of conserved T-cell epitopes. However, independently used peptides often lead to insufficient immunogenicity and require multiple immunizations. Immunogenicity can be enhanced by various strategies, including fusion expression or chemical linkage of epitope peptides with carrier proteins, synthetic synthesis of interlinked peptide repeats, and certain specific adjuvants [43]. \n\nVaccine development for infectious diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, dengue fever, and malaria, still faces many challenges due to pathogen mutation, multiple subtypes, the antibody-dependent enhancement effect infection, and immune escape [44]. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the application of innovative vaccine technology has accelerated the research and development, production, and application of vaccines. However, the emergence and prevalence of novel variant strains with immune escape characteristics have exceeded the speed of vaccine research and development, posing challenges to existing vaccines and highlighting the urgency of developing new vaccine technologies [45].",

Therefore, the provision of a safe and efficacious in silico-based vaccine should take precedence regarding public health concerns. 61,170 here is a diverse range of approaches in the development of CHIKV vaccines and vaccine candidates, each showing potential. These include live-attenuated CHIKV, recombinant CHIKV with nsP3 deletion, virus-like particles expressed from mammalian cells plus adjuvant, recombinant simian adenovirus vaccine expressing CHIKV structural proteins, recombinant measles vaccine expressing CHIKV structural proteins, mRNA vaccine encoding structural proteins, and mRNA encoding a CHIKV neutralizing antibody. 2][173][174] Several CHIKV vaccines targeting specific epitopes or peptide antigens from the virus' proteome have been developed using reverse vaccinology techniques. The E1, E2, 6 K, and E3 antigens of CHIKV were used by Mahmoodi et al. (2023)  175   cells and induction of cytokines that can combat CHIKV. 178 owever, Jaan et al. (2022) 179 designed an mRNA vaccine against CHIKV using the envelop glycoprotein of the virus, where they identified the most immunogenic and antigenic T-and B-cell epitopes.",

            "text": "Several vaccinology strategies have already been used for the identification of protective vaccine candidates against emerging and concerning human pathogens. Reverse vaccinology is an in silico approach that involves the mining of genome sequences using comparative analysis and prediction tools for the identification of antigens predicted to be highly prevalent, soluble and surface-exposed/secreted. Another vaccinology approach involves the proteomic analysis of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by bacteria, which provides deep insight into the proteins that could be exposed on the bacterial surface and potentially accessible to antibodies. Both technologies are frequently used as standalone strategies, and have contributed significantly to the identification of novel protective antigens. For example, vaccine antigens that provide protection against extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli [9,10] and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B [11,12] have been identified using these methods. \n\nHere, we employed a combinatorial approach encompassing both reverse vaccinology and proteomics to identify vaccine antigens of A. baumannii. Overall, our approach identified multiple novel candidate antigens that should form a framework for future vaccine development.",

The identified proteins are then tested in vitro and in vivo to determine whether they are immunogenic and induce protective antibodies. Reverse vaccinology has been used to develop a vaccine against the challenging Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B [42]. Unlike other N. meningitidis serogroups, serogroup B is covered by capsular polysaccharides that have similarities to human polysaccharides. This property substantially reduces the immunogenicity of these polysaccharides and could, at least theoretically, trigger antibodies against the human host and cause auto-immune diseases [42]. In addition, a vaccine relying on recombinant proteins has been unsuccessful because of the high antigenic variation in circulating strains [42]. Reverse vaccinology helped identify four novel antigenic proteins, which have been combined in a tetravalent meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero, GSK) [42]. By contrast, a more traditional approach of protein screening was used to develop a bivalent meningococcal B vaccine (Trumenba, Pfizer) [43].",

            "text": "The concept of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in the field of bacterial vaccines by Rappuoli (2001) about 10 years ago. RV does not attempt to develop vaccine candidates by the usual approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and determining which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatics analyses of entire bacterial genomes. In silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the surface-exposed proteins that the pathogen is able to express and these proteins are then produced by high-throughput technologies and tested for their immunoreactivity with patient sera as well as for their ability to induce protective antibodies (Rappuoli and Bagnoli, 2011). This strategy was called \"reverse\" vaccinology because the investigators operate in a so-called reverse manner, i.e., starting from the genome rather than from the organism, to discover which proteins are potential vaccine immunogens. This genome-based strategy has the advantage that hundreds of bacterial proteins are identified as candidate immunogens even if the bacteria cannot be cultivated.\n\nIn virology, RV has a different meaning altogether and refers to the strategy of generating a vaccine from the known crystallographic structure of nMabs bound to viral epitopes. The term \"reverse\" is used metaphorically in the sense that the investigator is trying to generate a vaccine starting from neutralizing antibodies instead of trying to generate such antibodies by immunization (Burton, 2002;. It is not clear, however, which vaccine discovery process is being reversed since the bnMab is simply used as a template to reconstruct its epitope outside the context of the natural antigen, using structure-based design technology. The assumption is then made that the reconstructed antigen designed to fit the bnMab will possess the immunogenic capacity of inducing a polyclonal antibody response with the same neutralizing capacity as the Mab.\n\nSince the RV approaches used for developing bacterial and viral vaccines are completely different it would be preferable to call them genome-based and structure-based RV, respectively (Van Regenmortel, 2011b). Both strategies require trial-and-error experimentation to ascertain which candidate bacterial or viral proteins are able to act as effective vaccine immunogens, and it is",

One of the focuses of this field involves the structural and functional studies of genetic materials and to perform in silico analysis [18,19]. This scope of bioinformatics will be helpful in vaccine production, as bioinformatic tools will help to reduce the time in the antigen and the epitope selection process [18,20]. It has to be highlighted that bioinformatic tools used in this technology are only used in vaccine designing and selection process. The rest of the vaccine production does involve the conventional methods in the manufacturing. One of the prominent roles of bioinformatics tool in vaccine design is predicting the reactivity of the antibody epitope in the immune response and led to an efficient vaccine manufacturing process. This technology could be applied in plantibody and revolutionized the manufacturing process of plantibodies [20]. \n\nReverse vaccinology is one of the widely utilized approach in the vaccine designing. Reverse vaccinology is a technique where bioinformatic tools would be used to design the vaccine by selecting the specific antigen or peptides required to induce immune response [18,21,22]. These selected peptide or antigen would be tested in mice to validate and further analyze the efficiency of the peptide or antigen [21]. Once the peptide or antigen is finalized, it can be incorporated into plant genome to produce plant-based vaccines. It is crucial that the genome sequence of the studied virus to be available to perform this technique. Reverse vaccinology saves a lot of time in vaccine production and allows to screen all multiple peptides at once to ease the selection process [18,21].",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins is one of the new approaches to create safe vaccines especially against nonculturable or difficult-to-culture viruses (Hudu et al. 2016) (Eisenstein 2011). The recombinant protein vaccines as the third-generation vaccines can induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular immune responses in the host (Fig. 1). In this type of vaccines, genes encoding protective antigens are recombinantly expressed (Baxter 2007) (Scott and Cheryl 2004). \n\nIn 1987, Hilleman M et al. developed Recombivax as the first recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B through cloning and recombinant expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hilleman 1987). Until now, numerous recombinant vaccines have been approved against viral pathogens such Human papilloma virus (Slade et al. 2009), Influenza (Girard et al. 2013), and bacterial pathogens including Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Jacobs et al. 1990) and Meningococcal (Cooper et al. 2011). \n\nRecently, a recombinant vaccine called shingrix has been developed against shingles disease caused by the varicella zoster virus with a high level protection (up to 90%) against this disease (Raedler 2018). One of the main challenges in the development of recombinant vaccines is the selection of the suitable target antigens. At present, reverse vaccinology is one of the promising approaches to identify repertoire of antigens that are highly antigenic, with surface exposure, and conserved among multiple strains (Rappuoli et al. 2016) (Zeng et al. 2017).",

Taking into consideration host protective mechanisms, antigen selection via the reverse vaccinology approach can be tailored to identify antigens that contain a combination of antigenic determinants and functional, conserved, and structural properties (He et al., 2010). In its nascent stage, the use of reverse vaccinology has yielded promising results and progress is being made toward the development of vaccines against several pathogens (Sette and Rappuoli, 2010;Bagnoli et al., 2011). Additionally, this approach is often used in an effort to narrow the number of candidate antigens to a working pool for validation and evaluation. Specifically, reverse vaccinology has aided in the identification of antigens that have protective antigenic determinants from various intracellular pathogens including Chlamydia, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Mycobacterium, and may represent a viable approach to the identification of antigens for immunization against brucellosis (McMurry et al., 2007;Finco et al., 2011;Zvi et al., 2011;Liebenberg et al., 2012;Sundaramurthi et al., 2012). \n\nIn addition, availability of genomic sequences has led to the development of whole proteome assays that have been used to determine antigen-specific antibody responses against Brucella spp. (Liang et al., 2010). A clear advantage of these assays is that they will aid in overcoming some limitations of traditional assays such as 2D gels, which are based on total bacterial lysates and its signal is dependent on the quantity of antigen in the preparation. While this approach will aid in screening immunodominant antigens that have potential vaccinogen value, this approach must be used as an ancillary rather than the sole criterion for antigen selection as humoral immunity does not always correlate with the more protective responses as described above. \n\nFIGURE 2 | Vaccine candidate selection approach.

            "text": "use of adjuvants [2]. Whereas the vaccine antigen intricacy may vary based on the state like the whole pathogen either inactivated, attenuated and split/subunit. Due to safety reasons, vaccines based on whole pathogens are being replaced by subunit and recombinant antigens and in this context, protein antigens and their epitopes are produced by the recombinant DNA technologies which make use of DNA sequence coding for the antigenic protein of the pathogen [3]. In view of the fact that antigens obtained abundantly not necessarily be the good vaccine candidates [4]. In order to improve vaccine efficacy, rational preclinical development of recombinant antigens and improved protocols for predicting the immunogenicity of antigens is an important endeavour. The efficacy of majority of the vaccine candidates prepared from purified recombinant antigens and peptides depends on the antigens alone, the success of subunit vaccines also depends on the adjuvants added to vaccine formulations to boost the immune response to the antigen [5,6]. Undoubtedly, investigation of the effect of dose of antigens on murine models before vaccine development is an important goal. Immunization protocols in mice models will integrate the biological complexities of the immune system and gives a maximum prediction of the efficacy as well as adverse effects [7]. In the present study, we have explored three recombinant antigens (HBsAg, JEV and DENV) for dose optimization required for screening the novel vaccine adjuvants or delivery systems.

            "text": "Should immunological data indicate that a disease can be prevented by an antibody response, it is important to select an appropriate antibody-inducing antigen. Induction of robust antibody responses by vaccines requires inclusion of relevant antigenic epitopes for B cells as well as T cell peptide epitopes to elicit appropriate T helper (Th) cell activation and assistance to B cells. Hence, selection of the optimal antigen is imperative in vaccine design. \n\nA successful strategy in the selection of the antigenic determinants as \"subunit\" vaccines is the isolation and inactivation of essential components of the pathogenic organism [69]. Chemically inactivated toxins isolated from bacteria have been exploited for diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This approach has also been pursued for subunit vaccines based on purified polysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, such as those developed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Salmonella typhi Vi. Saccharide-based vaccines have also been developed in multivalent forms to provide protection against numerous serotypes and serogroups [70]. \n\nCurrent strategies utilize reverse vaccinology approaches to select promising glyco-or protein-derived antigens based on structural studies of the target epitopes of potent antibodies [71,72]. Rational, structure-guided vaccine design can also involve the development of structurally simpler immunogens that present well-defined minimal epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, serving as epitope mimics for elicitation of more focused immune responses [73]. When refined recombinant or synthetic subunit vaccines are designed, the structural features of the antigen may strongly impact the desired antibody-response. \n\nStructural antigen vaccinology is a structural biology approach to design immunogenic antigens. It rationally aims to generate an effective antibody-inducing vaccine antigen, combining experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular biology, electron microscopy and mass spectrometry, with computational methods including molecular modeling, virtual screening and epitope prediction [74]. The identification of an antigen candidate is typically based on its cellular location.",

            "text": "The main application of HTS in medical research is the analysis of the genomes of pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, with HTS host-pathogen interaction can be studied and differences in the immune response of the host with respect to B and T cells can be analysed (31). All these HTS possibilities have found application in vaccine research. Recently, a new term in vaccinology has appeared -vaccinomics. This is a multidisciplinary field taking elements from immunology and genetics, with the creation of an individual vaccination therapy as its main goal. Vaccinomics allows the designer of vaccines to achieve faster results in the production of vaccines than traditional vaccinology can deliver. One of the parts of vaccinomics is reverse vaccinology, the reverse engineering of vaccines (20). \n\nReverse vaccinology is for the prediction of the most immunogenic epitope. A whole genome elucidated using HTS is then screened by very specialised and effective bioinformatic tools to identify such epitopes (20,42). Reverse vaccinology has enabled the design of vaccines against diseases such as anthrax, malaria, and meningitis (20). The bacterium Meningococcus B which causes the last of these diseases was actually first investigated by reverse vaccinology. The studies decoded the bacterial genome and assessed the antigenicity of over 600 potential antigens. Among the 90 detected surface proteins, 30% transpired to be capable of inducing bactericidal antibody secretion (23). \n\nReverse vaccinology recently focused on the identification of vaccine antigens by characterisation of the interactions between antigens and neutralising monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Guo et al. (15) demonstrated that the identification of functional peptide antigens is possible by the use of an HTS-enhanced mRNA display approach for mAb interrogation. These antigens target the immune response and are useful in vaccine reverse engineering for pathogens against which strong neutralising antibodies are available. Peptides identified through this approach were injected into mice. Consequently, the mice produced antibodies that were able to prevent hepatitis C virus infection (15). Reverse vaccinology may soon become the prescribed countermeasure against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",

This vaccine type is produced in vitro and circumvents handling highly pathogenic live viruses. 33,41 Subunit vaccines predominantly elicit a humoral antibody response, and most are administered with an adjuvant, which is a prerequisite to stimulate a strong immune response and generate a higherquality immune memory in humoral and cellular compartments. However, the inclusion of adjuvants can increase the reactogenicity and production costs, which are important considerations. 41 Virus-like particles (VLP) are a type of subunit vaccine that present many copies of the relevant antigen in a three-dimensional virus-like structure, and may be immunogenic enough to not require the inclusion of adjuvants. 41 ubunit vaccines are an attractive vaccine technology for rapid vaccine development, and multiple institutions worldwide are developing protein subunit-based vaccines (Table 1). They can be upscaled for mass production at good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, 42 and distribution has less reliance on cold-chain systems. 34 However, they can require bespoke manufacturing processes, which can increase cost, and may require specific mammalian cell expression and optimization. 18,43 cleic acid vaccines Similar to subunit vaccines, specific proteins from the target pathogen are chosen for their immunogenic epitopes; however, these proteins are delivered as either plasmid DNA or RNA sequences. 44,45 Upon vaccination, the host cell manufactures the pathogen protein, which is recognized by the immune system as foreign and generates an immune response. 44 Non-capsulated RNA vaccines are readily removed by the host cell upon injection, so advances in delivery technology, including encapsulation of RNA in liposomes, have been developed to avoid degradation. 46 NA vaccines have been shown to induce antigenspecific antibody and polyfunctional T-cell responses in phase I clinical trials of cancer vaccines, 46 and functional antibodies against rabies virus glycoprotein; 47 however, there are currently no licensed RNA vaccines for humans. Although DNA vaccines are immunogenic in small animal models, they show less immunogenicity in human clinical trials and require adjuvants or multiple doses.",

            "text": "Shigellosis is a significant type of diarrhea that causes 160,000 deaths annually in a global scale. The mortality occurs mainly in children less than 5 years of age. No licensed vaccine is available, and conventional efforts for developing an effective and safe vaccine against shigellosis have not been succeeded yet. The reverse vaccinology is a novel promising method that screens genome or proteome of an organism for finding new vaccine candidates. In this study, through reverse vaccinology approach, new vaccine candidates against Shigella flexneri were identified and experimentally evaluated. Proteomes of S. flexneri were obtained from UniProt, and then outer membrane and extracellular proteins were predicted and selected for the evaluation of transmembrane domains, protein conservation, host homology, antigenicity, and solubility. From 103 proteins, 7 high-scored proteins were introduced as novel vaccine candidates, and after B- and T-cell epitope prediction, the best protein was selected for experimental studies. Recombinant protein was expressed, purified, and injected to BALB/c mice. The adhesion inhibitory effect of sera was also studied. The immunized mice demonstrated full protection against the lethal dose challenge. The sera remarkably inhibited S. flexneri adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells. The results indicate that identified antigen can serve for vaccine development against shigellosis and support reverse vaccinology for discovering novel effective antigens. \u2022 Seven Shigella new antigens were identified by reverse vaccinology (RV) approach. \u2022 The best antigen experimented demonstrated full protection against lethal dose. \u2022 In vivo results verified RV analyses and suggest FimG as a new potent vaccine candidate.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is a novel approach that leverages genomic, proteomic, and immunomic technologies to expedite vaccine development, particularly for MDROs. Traditional vaccine development processes, which often rely on animal models and phase 3 clinical trials for efficacy evaluation, face significant challenges due to the unreliability of animal models and the absence of clear immunological correlates of protection. Reverse vaccinology overcomes these obstacles by identifying potential vaccine antigens through bioinformatics and by evaluating vaccine efficacy earlier in clinical development, in populations with a high incidence of disease [94]. This method allows for the identification of immune correlates of protection earlier in the vaccine development process, facilitating faster refinement of vaccine dosages, schedules, and formulations. By doing so, reverse vaccine development reduces the risk of large-scale trial failures and accelerates the delivery of life-saving vaccines for MDROs such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa [94]. \n\nFor P. aeruginosa, reverse vaccinology has identified key proteins such as the Type III secretion system proteins, which are crucial for its pathogenicity. By targeting these proteins, potential vaccines could disrupt the bacterium's ability to inject toxins into host cells, effectively neutralizing one of its primary mechanisms of infection. These vaccine candidates might also include other virulence factors like alginate and pilin, which are involved in biofilm formation and adhesion, respectively, addressing both acute and chronic infections by targeting the bacterial structures critical for colonization and persistence [95]. \n\nFor S. aureus, reverse vaccinology focuses on surface proteins like ClfA and IsdB, which mediate adhesion to host tissues, and the iron-regulated surface determinant proteins that help the bacterium acquire essential nutrients. Targeting these molecules can prevent colonization and dissemination within the host. Additionally, toxins such as alpha-toxin are considered for inclusion in vaccines to neutralize their cytotoxic effects. This approach aims to disarm the bacteria, limiting their ability to evade the immune system and cause severe infections, particularly in hospital settings where MRSA is a significant concern [95].",

            "text": "All the clinical vaccines mentioned above and in Table 2 have used well-known virulence factors as antigens in subunit vaccines. In general, subunit vaccines are safer and have a lower side effect profile compared to other vaccine types [93]. Discovery of novel conserved bacterial antigens is vital to continue investigating new immunisation approaches against P. aeruginosa. By using various bioinformatics screens alongside wholegenome sequencing data, researchers can use reverse vaccinology to identify desirable antigens for use in vaccines. Typically, those antigens which are abundantly expressed, highly conserved and immunogenic epitopes, and surface-exposed are most useful as vaccine candidates [94]. \n\nA small number of studies have used reverse vaccinology to identify unique antigens in P. aeruginosa. Rashid et al. first uncovered nine novel candidates, including three uncharacterized hypothetical proteins which may provide the basis of a subunit vaccine [95]. The presence of other components of known virulence factors, including surface components of antibiotic efflux pumps, T3SS and proteins on the bacterial cell wall, validates their approach. Using reverse vaccinology and additional bioinformatic tools, Bianconi and colleagues identified 52 total potential candidates which were conserved in P. aeruginosa strains of varying origin and in clinical isolates from CF patients [96]. The top ten antigens were used in vivo in a murine model of acute pneumonia in 22 separate combinations. The study concluded that combinations of candidate antigens provided the best protection. This strategy of using multiple antigens has been used in previous clinical vaccines [50,63], but should undergo further investigation. Additional reverse vaccinology approaches have identified numerous candidate antigens which are yet to undergo in vivo assessment [97,98]. \n\nA Th17-based reverse vaccinology study using a select library of outer membrane and secreted proteins identified PopB, a highly conserved component of the T3SS [99]. PopB elicited Th17 responses and IL-17 production and increased bacterial clearance in lethal P. aeruginosa murine pneumonia in an antibody-independent manner. \n\nTo further enhance antigen discovery, methods to identify novel antigens stimulating mechanisms of cellular immunity ought to be tried.",

Paradigms are sometimes followed because they appear to have been useful for achieving earlier vaccine successes and they may then continue to be used even if they are incompatible with more recent immunological knowledge (4,14). Other invalid paradigms used in HIV vaccinology have been discussed previously (4,(43)(44)(45).\n\nWHat is strUCtUre-Based reVerse VaCCinoLoGy (sBrV)?\n\nTwo types of reverse vaccinology should be distinguished. Genome-based reverse vaccinology, introduced by Rino Rappuoli (46) predicts potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatics analyses of entire bacterial genomes and has allowed the development of several effective bacterial vaccines (47). A completely different approach was proposed by Burton (48) for developing viral vaccines and it has been suggested that this should be called SBRV to clearly differentiate it from genome-based reverse vaccinology (49). Such a nomenclature is more explicit than calling the two procedures \"reverse vaccinology 1\" and \"reverse vaccinology 2, \" respectively (50).\n\nStructure-based reverse vaccinology attempts to generate a vaccine by first determining the X-ray crystallographic structure of a complex between, for instance, an HIV Env and a bnMab, and then using the 3D structure of the Mab as a template to reconstruct the epitope by reverse engineering outside the context of the Env protein in which it was originally embedded. This approach was called vaccine design because it was assumed that the reconstructed epitope designed to fit the Mab might be able to acquire the immunogenic capacity to induce a polyclonal Ab response endowed with the same neutralizing capacity as the bnMab. However, what was being designed was an antigen able to bind the Mab and not a viral immunogen able to induce a protective immune response (45,51).\n\nThe SBRV approach only focuses on the recognition process between a single epitope-paratope pair and it does not take into account that Abs are produced by the IS and not by the viral immunogen and that T cell help always play a crucial role. Properties of the IS such as the Ab gene repertoire, self-tolerance, the presence of appropriate helper and suppressor T cells, the production of cytok",

In conventional vaccinology, pathogen is first cultured then its immunogenic components are identified, isolated and purified by laboratory protocols followed by their validation in animal models. Due to inability to work upon uncultivable pathogens, time consumption in experiments and serious biohazards associated with highly infectious pathogens, reverse vaccinology was discovered as a new approach to identify potential vaccine candidates. This technique requires complete proteomes of sequenced pathogens and online tools which predict the vaccine candidates and screen large number of isolates for homology (Rappuoli 2000(Rappuoli , 2001;;Sette and Rappuoli 2010;Singh et al. 2016a;Solanki and Tiwari 2018). \n\nReverse vaccinology represents a complete and successful example of computer-aided biotechnology providing vaccine candidates for most complex and difficult to treat infections (Vivona et al. 2008). Whole genome and proteome of pathogens are available and plethora of computations tools help in identification of potential vaccine candidate proteins out of them. NERVE (Vivona et al. 2006), Vaxign (He 2010), VaxiJen (Doytchinova and Flower 2007), Jenner-Predict (Jaiswal et al. 2013), VacSol (Rizwan et al. 2017) and Bowman-Heinson (Bowman et al. 2011;Heinson et al. 2017) andVaxgin2 ((Ong et al. 2021)) are the major RV tools to predict potential vaccine candidates. Due to major limitations in conventional vaccinology, RV has become an initial and standard approach to search ideal vaccine candidates possessing certain characteristics (Rappuoli 2000;Singh et al. 2016a). The underlying principles in this approach are selection of proteins localized on cell surface as surface exposure of antigens is the most important requirement for the host-pathogen interaction. High level of antigen conservation is another fundamental requirement in this approach, as to provide broad spectrum immunity covering all the strains of pathogen is necessary.",

            "text": "Structural vaccinology was fundamental to generate stabilized pre-F trimers that preserved key epitopes in the proper conformation to elicit the most neutralizing activity in human sera [81,82]. Another example is the licensed 4-component vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) composed of three recombinant proteins and a bacterial membrane vesicle selected using a reverse vaccinology approach (Section 2.2) [13]. Structure-based design was subsequently used to generate a vaccine made of chimeric antigens, by retaining epitopes from two antigens (fHbp and PorA), thus potentiating its power to elicit functional humoral immune responses against MenB [83]. These two examples illustrate that structural vacci-nology can generate novel vaccine antigen candidates with improved characteristics for antibody-based strategies. \n\nThe potential improvement in the identification of antigenic determinants expressed on cancer cells enabled the design of therapeutic subunit vaccine to treat cancer [84][85][86]. Although the use of cancer vaccines awaits meaningful clinical benefits several tumorassociated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are currently largely validated and have been used to design promising molecular vaccines. Conjugation of these TACAs to proteins or the development of altered-self, i.e., more immunogenic, TACA analogues are examples of current strategies to make TACA-based vaccines able to break immune tolerance and elicit cancer antigen-specific antibodies [87].",

The identification of highly conserved antigenic targets, facilitated by bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the success in developing multi-epitope vaccines that encompass various antigenic targets, holds the potential for broader protection against emerging diseases and expedites development timelines. For instance, a contemporary genome-based strategy, known as reverse vaccinology, has exhibited promise by identifying potential vaccine candidates (relevant protein antigens) through computational analyses of a pathogen's proteome. Additionally, integrating bioinformatics with immunogenetics has revolutionized vaccine design, contributing to improvements in effectiveness, safety, specificity, and thermodynamic stability compared to conventional vaccine development approaches. Despite its success in developing effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens in humans, such as Neisseria meningitidis, reverse vaccinology is still under investigation for poultry vaccine development. Nevertheless, ongoing research is exploring its application in the development of multi-epitope vaccines targeting bacterial pathogens such as M. gallisepticum, C. jejuni, and C. perfringens, viral pathogens such as IBD and chicken anemia virus, and parasitic pathogens such as Eimeria species in poultry. \n\nWhile not yet implemented in poultry, the success of the nanoparticle delivery system demonstrated in humans holds promise for the potential application of this technology in mucosal vaccine delivery for animals, including chickens. Ongoing research is actively exploring the feasibility of this approach for delivering vaccines to chickens, taking into consideration the relatively high costs associated with particle production. Lastly, the persistent challenge faced by the poultry industry stems from the continual emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, particularly in the \"post-antibiotic era\", necessitating a continuous improvement of vaccine effectiveness, stability, and delivery.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology, structural vaccinology, synthetic biology, and vaccine adjuvants, that so far had been used independently to develop vaccines, were combined in an unprecedented worldwide effort to design and develop COVID-19 vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology, the science that identifies vaccine antigens from the genome of pathogens, was used for the first time in 2000 to identify novel antigens for vaccine against meningococcus B, which, up to that moment, had been an impossible task for conventional technologies (7,8). The vaccine was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2013 and by Food and Drug Administration in 2015 and was recently shown to reduce by 74% the incidence of disease in United Kingdom and by 91% in Italy (9,10). During the last two decades, genomics has been used in the development of most vaccines, exploiting the pangenome of bacterial and viral species. Remarkable progress in genomebased vaccines was made in 2013 when an RNA vaccine against a potentially pandemic H7N9 influenza virus was produced in 1 wk without culturing the virus but using the genome sequence available in public databases (3). During the last few years, tumor immunologists used the genome of cancer cells to identify mutations coding for neoantigens to be incorporated in cancer vaccines (11). \n\nStructural vaccinology, or structure-based antigen design, was predicted as an emerging field in 2007 when it became clear that high-throughput structure determination was going to be possible in the near future (12). However, it had already been anticipated in 2002 that the study of antibodies recognizing protective epitopes was going to inform vaccine design (13). The first example, published in 2011, was the design of a single meningococcal antigen containing the epitopes of three antigenic variants of the same molecule (14). In 2013, structure-based vaccine design was used for the first time to develop a vaccine that had been impossible for other technologies, when McLellan et al. (15,16) described the stabilization of the Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) Fusion (F) protein in the prefusion conformation.",

            "text": "In the last several years, the range of types of vaccines adopted in viral vaccines that have reached approval for human use has increased (Table 1). Traditional viral vaccine production technologies have been mostly based on whole viruses (either inactivated or live-attenuated). Recombinant subunit viral vaccines were an innovation enabled by the development of recombinant DNA technology, and the first human vaccine of this type was approved in 1986 [14,15]. However, intensive research in the field of vaccinology in the last few decades paved the path for the approval of new vaccine technologies for human use, such as viral vectored and nucleic acid vaccines [16][17][18][19][20]. These new technologies, which had been in development for many years for a range of different diseases, have proven very useful to help control public health emergencies. Subunit vaccines contain one or more fragments of the pathogen and can be of different classes, depending on the type of antigen it contains: (i) toxoid; (ii) polysaccharide conjugate; (iii) outer membrane vesicle; and (iv) recombinant protein/VLP [25]. Whereas the three first types form the basis of several bacterial vaccines approved to date, the latter type is of great significance in the field of viral vaccines. \n\nBased on recombinant DNA technology developed in the 1970s, a new era of viral vaccines based on recombinant viral proteins started in 1986, when the first recombinant hepatitis B vaccine containing the surface antigen produced in engineered yeast was licensed for human use [14,15]. However, it was just in the last two decades that further recombinant subunit viral vaccines were licensed for human use: two HPV vaccines (Gardasil \u00ae , Cervarix \u00ae ) in 2006 and 2007 [26], a hepatitis E vaccine in 2012 [27], a flu vaccine in 2013 [28], a malaria vaccine (positively reviewed by the European Medicines Agency in 2015 and recommended for widespread use by the World Health Organization in 2021) [29][30][31], a zoster vaccine in 2017 [32], and COVID-19 subunit vaccines in 2021-2022 [33,34].",

Such antibodies would circumvent potential reactogenicity of antibodies made in other species. The extent by which DNA vaccine technology can be used to develop immunotherapeutics against infectious agents, including biological threat agents for which neither immune sera produced using licensed vaccines nor convalescent sera/plasma are available, is a matter for future exploration.",

Current reverse vaccinology approaches include comparative in silico analyses of multiple genome sequences, which enable the identification of conserved antigens within a heterogeneous pathogen population and the identification of antigens present in pathogenic but not commensal strains [119]. Moreover, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets are integrated into a selection process that allow for the accelerated identification of vaccine targets to be tested in animal models. Reverse vaccinology was successfully applied against serogroup B meningococcus [120]. This technology was also used in advanced preclinical and clinical vaccine studies against several pathogens, including those resistant to antibiotics [121].",

            "text": "The antibody is an excellent weapon to resist bacteria and other pathogenic microorganism infections, and it also has a specific neutralization effect on some viruses free from the cell. Preventive vaccines generally require a long-acting IgG antibody response, while therapeutic vaccines to treat chronic infections or cancers rely on inducing powerful CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cell responses 167,168 . Therefore, different strategies are often considered to achieve the target immune response for preventive and therapeutic vaccine design. On the other hand, it is common for animal models and human settings to have different immune outcomes. The differences in features and functions for anatomical structures, disease models, and PRR expressions between humans and mice may have vital impacts. Finally, safety is also a critical indicator to be considered. Because available vaccines are often used in healthy children or adolescents, improving vaccine safety and avoiding side effects is indispensable 169 . Even though subunit vaccine delivery carriers are expanding in terms of their functions and compositions, there is still a long way for them to translate into clinical applications. Many other essential issues need to be addressed, including the ability for scale-up production, the cost of commodities, cold-chain maintenance, the in vivo stability of antigens, and vector suitability for multiple antigens 170 . With the continuous development of artificial intelligence in cancer immunotherapy, this advanced technology gradually infiltrates into medical science to improve healthcare safety and quality 171 . We suppose that these existing problems may be answered using artificial intelligence technology to perform in vitro virtual screening and in vivo verification. Interestingly, machine learning has been used to predict vaccine system formulations and assist in choosing proper excipients, while the molecular dynamic simulation could study the interaction between drugs and additional components 172 . \n\nIn the design of a subunit vaccine, the appropriate antigen is a primary factor. Model antigen OVA is generally used in subunit vaccine studies to verify the effectiveness of delivery vectors and adjuvants. However, many discrepancies in physicochemical properties, immunogenicity, and adjuvants combined with model antigens or disease antigens, may lead to different immune cascade processes in vivo. Designing, engineering, and identifying suitable and highly immunogenic subunit antigens remain pivotal challenges.",

            "text": "Novel technologies currently under investigation represent the most valuable tools to be applied in vaccinology and could be used today for addressing the medical needs of the twenty-first century. Despite decades of efforts and investigation, satisfactory vaccines have not yet been developed against several of the most life-threatening infections, including tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, which claim the lives of more than 4 million people worldwide each year. The high levels of variability of their antigenic proteins and the required induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses have not allowed us to use conventional vaccinology methods as successful strategies. The advent of a new approach, named structural vaccinology, could represent today a valid revolutionary alternative leading in the next years to an efficacious vaccine design. Through the combination of human immunology, structural biology, and bioinformatics knowledge, antigenic epitopes are identified based on the protein amino acid sequences and the resulting secondary and tertiary structures. The principle is based on the observation that an efficacious immune response does not require the recognition of the entire antigenic protein, but the recognition of multiple selected epitopes might be sufficient to induce protective immunity (42). Progresses in technologies aimed at interrogating the human B cell repertoire are providing for the first time the possibility of isolating broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting relevant conserved epitopes (43)(44)(45). A deeper characterization of the crystal structure of an antigen in complex with protective antibodies represents the launching point for immunogen design to select relevant epitopes from a vaccine standpoint. Once identified they can be expressed in a recombinant form and in an immunodominant fashion to be used as potent immunogens (Figure 2). Recently, the group of Kwong et al. (46) using a structure-based approach designed an immunogen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that elicits higher protective responses than the postfusion form of the fusion glycoprotein, which is one of the current leading RSV vaccine candidates entering clinical trials. Importantly, highly protective responses were elicited in both mice and macaques. Structural vaccinology combined with human immunology are therefore rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative strategy for the rational design of engineered vaccines bearing multiple antigenic epitopes offering the opportunity",

DIVA vaccination is one of the most promising strategies based on subunit technology, where well-defined and highly purified recombinant proteins (antigens) can raise a protective immune response against infection. The development of an efficacious subunit vaccine (marker vaccine) based on recombinant secretory proteins of MAP needs a combination of antigens appropriate for the broad range of varied MHC molecules present in an immune-competent outbred ruminant population (Derrick et al. 2004;Cai et al. 2005;Sable, Verma, Behera, et al. 2005;Sable, Verma, Khuller, 2005;Grover et al. 2006). Immune responses to recombinant antigens of MAP have been studied and demonstrated the protective effects of recombinant MAP antigens in mice (Chen et al. 2008) and calves (Kathaperumal et al. 2008). In the latter study, protective efficacy of recombinant antigens was assessed for 85A, 85B, SOD and Map74F antigens in a goat model. While MAP is intracellular in nature, a Th1 response mediated by IFNg-secreting sensitized T-cells plays a major protective role similar to other mycobacterial infections (Flynn et al. 1993;Flynn and Chan et al. 2001;Koets et al. 2002;Skeiky et al. 2004). Here, recombinant secretory antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation was detected after 3 weeks of booster vaccination, which was significantly higher in the vaccinated groups than control groups, indicating the induction of recombinant antigen-specific cellular immunity. Immunization of goats with the recombinant secretory antigens gave a sustained antibody response for a prolonged period. The study indicated that the recombinant secretory antigens stimulated both CMI and humoral immune response. After booster vaccination, antibody response was significantly increased in animals vaccinated with recombinant secretory antigens compared with unvaccinated control group.",

            "text": "In a first line, structure-based insights [48] and new methodological approaches have paved the way to what is today known as modern vaccinology [49]. A genome based approach to vaccine development leading to the birth of so-called \"reverse vaccinology\" [50] came with the sequencing of the Haemophilus influenzae genome in 1995 [51]. Vaccine development further moved forward with the gain of knowledge which allowed to rapidly identify highly immunogenic antigens by analyzing the human immune system at the level of single cells and specific proteins, leading to an eventual assessment of the antibody response [52]. The production of germ-line (GT) targeting antigens for vaccine design represents an important example of modern vaccine development [49]. In case of a highly variable virus, such as HIV, the use and development of GT antigens can lead to the production of bnAbs which should be able to clear multiple infective virus strains [3]. Development of vaccines based on GT targeting antigens has been successfully applied to elicit a specific class of gp120 CD4-binding site specific bnAbs of the HIV-1 virus (known as VRC01, see also [53]) by using engineered Outer Domain Germline-Targeting (eOD-GT) peptides [29]. \n\nAn approach to overcome several obstacles discussed above by relying on a virus-like particle (VLP) was recently reported by Schief and colleagues [29]. They were able to boost the affinity of the germline antibodies for the gp120 glycoprotein by fusing multiple copies (in fact 60) of an engineered version of gp 120 to the icosahedral 60 subunit complex of lumazine synthase (LS). More specifically, the thermostable AaLS was used as nanoparticle platform for the display of the epitope [10]. It is well-known that the envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the only HIV surface protein to which neutralizing antibodies bind. Env is made of three gp160 precursor proteins that form a trimer. Each of them is subsequently cleaved into gp120 and gp41 monomers.",

            "text": "The present study systematically reviewed approaches used regarding recombinant proteins for diagnosing and developing protective vaccines against M. bovis. A practical and rapid diagnostic method is necessary to identify animals infected with M. bovis and minimize livestock losses. Here, we observed a predominance of successful studies using modern approaches to identify recombinant proteins obtained from a panel of sera and isolated strains of M. bovis, which were used to develop indirect ELISAs to detect M. bovis. This serological technique is currently the most widely used to detect specific antibodies and has advantages in using many samples for screening, making it ideal for surveillance and biosecurity programs. On the other hand, despite numerous efforts, developing protective recombinant vaccines to control M. bovis infection has not been successful. Much research in this area is still needed, especially regarding the development of an animal challenge model, the identification of antigens that could trigger antibodies to protect animals from the challenge, the best route for immunization, and the ideal age for vaccinating animals, which remains a barrier to adequate protection. Thus, a significant challenge researchers face in developing new immunization strategies is designing vaccines that induce an appropriate immune response to confer immunity, especially against intracellular pathogens, particularly those that establish chronic infections, often throughout life. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the biology of highly conserved antigens involved in pathogenesis and the immunological mechanisms that need to be triggered for protection to rationally design vaccine strategies that can overcome the low protective immunity naturally generated by infection. Hopefully, the use of reverse vaccinology and bioinformatics tools will enable the proteomic analysis of M. bovis and, consequently, the detection of new proteins that can be used not only as diagnostic biomarkers but also in the development of a potent vaccine for the effective control of M. bovis infections.",

            "text": "In recent years, great success has been recorded in the development of vaccines. Recent advances in recombinant DNA technologies will continue to play a key role in shaping future ORFV vaccine development. Future vaccine design technologies would focus on various strategies that are particularly promising in their potential to mimic desired immune responses to challenging antigens for which current vaccination strategies have proven ineffective [167,[174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181][182]184]. As with current ORFV vaccine platforms, there is a need for the development of a novel vaccine with increased efficiency/safety profiles [144,159,173].and improved adjuvants and sustained delivery strategies to overcome the current limitation observed in vaccines against ORFV infection [162]. The novel technologies are expected to improve the safety [144] and efficacy of future vaccines [144,174,182]. \n\nFurthermore, vaccines against ORFV and other small ruminants in the live-stock production industries are under huge demand in order to increase their application in the field. The future vaccine platforms should be designed to fulfill three main constraints; (1) compatibility with mass vaccination, (2) cost-effectiveness for large-scale production and delivery, (3) most importantly, they should be safe, effective, and efficacious. However, such constraints can serve as a benchmark for determining the efficacy of future vaccine platforms [4,25,84,173,185]. A schematic outline of some future vaccines against ORFV (Figure 4). The future vaccines against ORFV infections include nanoparticle-based subunit and/or peptide vaccines, DNA vaccine, and parapoxvirus vectored vaccines. Thus, the application of such vaccines can minimize the use of the attenuated virus that might easily reverse to virulent [147,174,184]. Subunit and peptide vaccines are composed of either glycoproteins [163] or proteins derived from specific ORFV genes that are actively involved in eliciting robust immunity [25,84,124,170].",

            "text": "The recent advances in the large scale-production of viral particles have enabled researchers and developers to produce high titer of viruses in bioreactors. Moreover, the fast development of viral vector-based vaccines during several months makes them suitable candidates for vaccine production in pandemics with low cost [27,28]. However, there are some concerns regarding their wide application. For example, the expression of viral vector genes which is necessary for its transmission or amplification may alter the responses of host immune system to desired antigens. Since various types of adenoviruses are circulating in populations, the pre-existing antibodies against these viruses may neutralize the viral-vector based vaccine before starting immune response to desired antigens [29]. Even if the pre-existing antibodies against the vector do not exist, the administration of repeated doses can elevate the titer of such antibodies limiting the application of this platform as booster shot [30]. Considering the major advantages of this platform, some COVID-19 candidate vaccines could obtain regulatory approval for human application including ChAdOx1-S and Ad26. COV2-S [31].\n\nRecombinant protein vaccines are produced in the forms of subunit or virus-like particles (VLP). While subunit vaccines contain recombinant immunogenic viral proteins with the ability to induce immune response, VLPs are composed of viral antigens with the ability to be selfassembled into supramolecular structures to mimic native viruses in terms of geometry and particle size [32,33]. The process of large-scale production of recombinant vaccines is laborious, expensive and time-consuming. However, some categories of this platform including VLPs are able to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses making them suitable candidates for vaccine development in pandemics. The production of subunit protein vaccine starts with finding the appropriate antigens with the ability to elicit immune response and expression of desired recombinant proteins in suitable organisms offering high protein yields [34]. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is one of the successful examples of this vaccine platform. On the other hand, VLPs can either be formed via self-assembly by expressing antigenic proteins in a eukaryotic or prokaryotic system or the expression of blank proteins and subsequent conjugation",

            "text": "The sequencing of the first bacterium genome in 1995 [15] ushered vaccine development into a new era. Suddenly, all proteins encoded by a pathogen were discernible and it became possible to identify vaccine candidates without using conventional vaccinology principles. The concept of reverse vaccinology involves screening the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes encoding proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets (i.e., surface-exposed, secreted, highly conserved among strains). Ideal candidates are selected, expressed and used to immunize mice for evaluation of immunogenicity and protection based on the analysis of antisera [16,17]. Reverse vaccinology allows for identification of a broad spectrum of vaccine candidates independent of abundance and immunogenicity during infection or ability to be cultivated in the laboratory. One of the limitations of the reverse vaccinology approach is the inability to identify nonprotein antigens such as polysaccharides, a component of many successful vaccines. \n\nThe first successful application of reverse vaccinology was for Group B meningococcus (MenB). This bacterium had been refractory to vaccine development because its capsular polysaccharide is identical to a human self-antigen and the bacterial surface proteins are extremely variable. Using reverse vaccinology, fragments of RNA were screened by computer analysis while the MenB nucleotide genome sequence was being determined. Immunoinformatics uses mathematical and computational approaches to develop algorithms to predict T-cell and B-cell immune epitopes, cellular localization of proteins (surface-exposed, secreted) by screening multiple genome sequences. Six hundred novel genes were predicted to code for surface-exposed or secreted proteins. These were cloned and expressed in E. coli as fusions to either glutathione transferase or a histidine tag. Of these fusion proteins, 350 were successfully expressed, purified and used to immunize mice [18,19]. The sera obtained was used to confirm surface exposure of the proteins by ELISA and FACS analysis and for the ability to induce complement-mediated in vitro killing of bacteria, a test correlating with vaccine efficacy in humans.",

Copyright (2022), with permission from John Wiley and Sons. \n\nDNA manipulation using recombinant DNA technology has been intimately associated with our understanding of microorganisms including the pathogens that cause many infectious diseases in humans [122]. The scaling-up of antigen production for subunit vaccines design can readily be achieved from techniques that enable us to read, copy and manipulate DNA sequences. \n\nA good example is the development of vaccines against the human papilloma virus (HPV) as illustrated on Figure 4: three prophylactic HPV vaccines based on the recombinant DNA technology were approved and purified L1 protein self-assembled as HPV empty shells and induced production of specific neutralizing antibodies [123]. One should notice that not all antigens self-assemble to yield NPs in dispersion. In many cases the vaccine subunit design requires also adjuvant(s) and/or immunostimulator(s). The technique of DNA cloning signaled the birth of genetic engineering, which allowed the facile transfer of genes among different biological species [124]. Thereby, genes encoding important recombinant proteins such as insulin and growth hormone were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisae; hundreds of pharmaceuticals such as therapeutic proteins and antibodies, including the monoclonal ones, became available in the market produced by the biotechnology industry [125]. Recombinant DNA technology indeed represents a valuable tool also in vaccines development which contributed to the fast design of COVID-19 vaccines applied during the recent pandemics as discussed next. \n\nCationic NPs also played a fundamental role in the delivery of mRNA vaccines, as highlighted by their successful use in the COVID-19 vaccination [126,127].",

            "text": "The term \"reverse vaccinology\", coined by Rappuoli, is a genome-based approach for vaccine design and development [171,172]. Traditional vaccine development approaches involve laborious and time-consuming testing of immunogenic and protective potential of several pathogen-derived antigens to identify and develop the best candidate vaccines. On the other hand, reverse vaccinology employs in silico analysis of genome and protein sequences of pathogens, facilitating systematic identification of all the potential antigens for downstream testing and development of vaccine candidates [172]. This approach can significantly reduce the time and the cost needed to identify vaccine candidates and is also suitable for the difficult-to-culture pathogens [173]. Reverse vaccinology approaches are currently being used for designing vaccines against diverse viruses, bacteria, and other parasitic infections [171,174,175]. The bioinformatic approaches used in reverse vaccinology consider the following features of a pathogen to identify the potential useful antigens/epitopes: (a) unique protein sequence, (b) high-scoring B cell and T cell epitopes, (c) highly conserved sequences, (d) peptide sequences that can bind to pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, and (e) ability to be presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules irrespective of their diversity among human populations [176].\n\nIn reverse vaccinology for viruses, the viral genomes are sequenced and aligned to identify the regions unique to the given strain of the virus. So far, hundreds of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced and their sequences are available in public databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/). Further, an open-source genome browser was developed for interactive sequence visualization with downstream applications, including vaccine design [177]. For example, a recent study has designed potentially effective vaccine targets using reverse vaccinology and machine learning (ML) [178] In this study, the authors compared genomes of several CoVs using Vaxign-ML and predicted the S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins to be highly antigenic.

Earlier, the development of new antimicrobial agents and vaccine therapies was limited due to a computational technology bottleneck. However, in this post-genomic era, advances in the fields of genomics, proteomics, coupled with the development of bioinformatics tools have allowed for in silico identification of new drug candidates and vaccine targets from genomics, and protein sequence resources using the subtractive genomic approach or reverse vaccinology approach [28]. The reverse vaccinology approach is a powerful method for the identification of unique yet uncharacterized sequences as possible therapeutic targets [29][30][31]. Reverse vaccinology reduces the time needed to develop new vaccines and offers flexibility even for non-cultivable pathogens [32]. This approach also allows not only the detection of all the antigens as observed through the conventional methods but also the discovery of novel antigens that function on a different paradigm [18].",

            "text": "When crystallographers study the structure of an Env epitope recognized by a neutralizing Mab, they often claim that their data will help the rational design of vaccine immunogens able to elicit antibodies endowed with the same neutralizing capacity as the Mab used to define the epitope [25][26][27]. \n\nIn vaccine development, the term design usually means selecting a vaccine candidate and finding appropriate vaccine formulations, schedules, adjuvants and routes of administration. The strategy of rational, structure-based design discussed here is more circumscribed since it refers to the development and optimization of a vaccine immunogen within the restricted context of a single Mab-antigen pair. This approach assumes that if a viral antigen can be modified so that it binds better to a neutralizing Mab, it will have acquired the immunogenic capacity of eliciting neutralizing polyclonal antibodies [28]. \n\nIt will be argued here that the claims of reverse vaccinology are based (1) on misconceptions regarding the nature of protein epitopes and of immunological specificity, (2) on the assumption that a discontinuous epitope defined by X-ray crystallography can act as an effective vaccine immunogen on its own without being embedded in a multi-epitopic protein that always induces many different types of antibodies, (3) on the belief that effective vaccine immunogens can be predicted from the antigenic structure of viral antigens bound to neutralizing Mabs. \n\nResearch carried out over the last two decades has demonstrated that reverse vaccinology has not been able to guide the design of an HIV vaccine nor of any other viral vaccine [29]. The present review expands on an earlier analysis of the limitations of reverse vaccinology [29] and shows that antibody polyspecificity explains why elucidating the structure of viral epitopes recognized by a neutralizing Mab is of little use for discovering immunogens capable of inducing a protective immune response.",

            "text": "Traditionally, mapping of immunodominant B cell epitopes required identification of the whole protein first, followed by the assessment of its fragments for reactivity with antibodies. This approach to antigen discovery and epitope mapping is time consuming, labor intensive and expensive. Advances in Omics approaches, such as protein microarrays to map the reactivity of antibodies and T cells to antigens, availability of various databases related to host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, tools for structural analyses and computational capabilities for theoretical predictions have tremendously helped in antigen discovery [5][6][7]. In particular, the in silico analytical and predictive methods have greatly facilitated all aspects of biological research including vaccinology. The approach of reverse vaccinology has become an integral part of rational vaccine design. This involves computational mining and analysis of large datasets related to immune responses to pathogens, host-pathogen interactions and host and pathogens genomes to predict promising antigen candidates. This entails large-scale sampling of potential antigens and down selection based on affinity for the antibodies or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules for experimental validation. \n\nStructural vaccinology is another approach which is facilitating rational design of better antigens. The availability of structures of viral proteins as well as antigen-antibody complexes has made it possible to carry out docking and modeling studies for prediction of B cell epitopes. This approach has been used to develop strongly immunogenic vaccine candidates from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) glycoprotein and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus spike protein [8,9]. High-throughput in vitro assays combined with structure-function analyses have been successfully used to discover broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against influenza HA stalk, HIV V2 and V3 glycans and Dengue envelope protein [10][11][12]. Structural information of bNAbs-antigen complexes has been used to graft linear as well as discontinuous HIV epitopes on to computationally designed scaffolds to develop designer antigens [13,14]. NGS-based profiling of antibody repertoire induced by such antigens can help in identification of bNAbs and improved antigens.",

Within 18 months, while the nucleotide sequence was still being finalized, 91 novel surface-exposed proteins were discovered and 28 of these were shown to induce bactericidal antibodies, a known correlate of protection against MenB disease [20]. Discovered antigens that induced the best and broadest bactericidal activity were selected and inserted into prototype vaccines that were able to induce protective immunity against most MenB strains in mice [21]. After further analysis, a final four-component MenB (4CMenB) vaccine was formulated [16]. \n\nPrior to the emergence of reverse vaccinology, only 12 surface antigens of meningococcus had been described in the literature, with four or five having bactericidal activity [18,22]. With reverse vaccinology, 91 novel surface-exposed proteins were discovered with 28 capable of inducing bactericidal activity, representing more than quarter of all novel surface-exposed proteins. The concurrent use of genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics and protein arrays can significantly accelerate identification of vaccine targets and the subsequent vaccine development process. The success of the MenB vaccine has encouraged application of reverse vaccinology to a myriad of other pathogens (both bacterial and viral), including group B streptococcus where analysis of eight genomes led to expression of 312 surface proteins and the development of a four-protein vaccine that protects against all serotypes [23].",

            "text": "The greatest challenges, for both human and animals, is to elicit a strong, balanced, and stable immune response at a very early age when infants and calves are at the greatest risk of being severely affected by RSV infection. Looking at current R&D activities and the resulting patent applications, three technologies stand out that are frequently applied for in all three fields: live attenuated, sub-unit antigen-based and nucleic-acid-based vaccines. The results clearly indicate that the veterinary field continues to rely on the technology of live attenuated vaccines, as a reliable and cost-effective method of vaccination. This is in line with the commonly shared idea that veterinary disease control must be cost-efficient [38]. Initially, immunization in humans with virus-inactivated vaccines resulted in enhanced disease progression after natural infection in vaccinated infants. This led to serious concerns about the safety and discontinuation of this vaccine technology for use in the human field. Recently, new attenuated strains have been generated for human use, but it proved difficult to select live candidates with the right combination of safety and immunogenicity. Only one new candidate strain revealed to be safe, moderately immunogenic, and genetically stable for infants and children, aged 6-24 months old [39]. \n\nThe prominent patent applications for the development of human subunit-vaccines are due to new insights into structural aspects of the viral proteins, allowing the design of a vaccine with a conformation close to their native viral form, leading to the development of several subunit vaccines [40]. For the veterinary field, recently two sub-unit vaccine candidates were found to be safe and effective for one-month-old calves with maternally derived serum antibodies [41], suggesting that the subunit-vaccine technology is promising for the development of vaccines in both fields. The development of vaccines using nucleic acid technology is found in all fields, with mRNA inventions only being used in the human field.",

Based on the investigation of 127 studies analyzing Salmonella loads in the ceca, liver, or spleen of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice, chicken, swine, ovine, and bovine, live-attenuated vaccine candidates were the most frequently used (61 studies), followed by subunit vaccines (24 studies) and inactivated killed vaccine (12 studies) (Figure 2c). The majority of investigations in swine focused on the development of live-attenuated vaccination candidates (n = 12), highlighting the importance of assessing the efficacy of new-generation vaccinations in combating Salmonella infection within the swine industry. Bacterial ghost vaccines were also used in mice and chicken models to combat multidrug-resistant Salmonella serovars. Only three trials (one in the chicken model and two in the mouse model) were found in which antigens were prepared using a reverse vaccinology approach. \n\nThe shift in vaccination types in different animal models between 1970 and 2023 is shown (Figure 3). Initially, killed inactivated, rough attenuated, and few mutant-attenuated strains (galE mutant strain of S. Typhi, aroA and cya crp double-deletion strategy, and galE mutant strain of S. Gallinarum) vaccines were evaluated in mice, bovine, swine, and chickens before the year 2000. However, over the past decade, there has been a noticeable increase in the use of mutant-attenuated, subunit, and bacterial ghost vaccines in different animal models. Vaccine candidates prepared through the reverse vaccinology approach have also been evaluated in the chicken and murine models recently.",

For instance, through genomic analysis, it is now known that the viral genome contains potential antigens which are not necessarily part of the final viral particle. It is also now known that some antigens are present in such low quantities that they cannot be purified in enough quantities and used as antigens by conventional approaches for vaccine development [185]. In this regard, we are proposing a computer-guided genome-based vaccine development approach in reverse vaccinology technology. The whole SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence is readily available and continues to be updated as new variants emerge. Computer programs could be used to predict all SARS-CoV-2 sequences with antigenic properties and those sequences that are less susceptible to mutation. In-silico technology could then be used to screen for all vaccine candidates regardless of how small. Hits with high fidelity for helper T cell 1 and helper T cell 2 can then be developed into DNA vaccines and expressed as recombinant proteins. The recombinant proteins can then be engineered with bispecific anti-bodies and the efficiency of immunogenicity tested in animal models and subsequently developed into COVID-19 vaccine. This approach has proven effective for HIV vaccine development [186][187][188] and corroborated the assertion that reverse vaccinology approach could be the most appropriate approach for the development of vaccines for pathogens with no obvious immunodominant protective antigens such as COVID-19 and/or non-cultivable pathogens.",

Vaccine failures have been related to surface antigenic variation of Cfv or the existence of diversity in surface antigens among regional strains [15]. \n\nVaccines against pathogens evolved from incorporating whole organisms (e.g. bacterins) to recombinant vaccines, including multi-epitope vaccines, which are composed of highly antigenic peptides capable of eliciting an effective immune response [16]. Whereas the traditional methods for vaccine development are expensive and time-consuming, the recently emerged reverse vaccinology technology and bioinformatic tools have significantly reduced the time and cost of vaccine development [17]. A new generation of vaccines arose from these novel strategies based on analysis of pathogen's genome and identification of proteins with favourable characteristics to be used as vaccine targets [18]. In fact, several vaccines with promising results have been developed against other Campylobacter species, using reverse vaccinology approaches [19,20]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this approach was not described to develop a vaccine against Cfv. Therefore, this study aimed to identify potential vaccine targets and design a multi-epitope vaccine against Cfv for the control of BGC, using a reverse vaccinology approach.",

            "text": "Several approaches have been developed recently that have the potential to produce safer vaccines. The use of the genomic information that is available on important microorganisms and the approach termed 'reverse vaccinology' enables the identification of novel recombinant antigens that have the potential to be excellent vaccine candidates [44]. Based on the experience with the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, it is expected that these highly purified recombinant antigens will prove to be much safer than traditional vaccines. Several novel vaccine adjuvants with improvements over alum are currently undergoing clinical and preclinical testing, including 'delivery systems' that are designed to promote the uptake of antigens into key cells of the immune system and potent immunopotentiators that are designed to have a higher specificity for the activation of these cells [45]. The most significant barrier to the development of new adjuvants has been the requirement for safety, but an emulsionbased adjuvant (MF59) was introduced onto the European market in 1997 [46] and additional approaches are expected to follow in the coming years. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of how adjuvants work has already resulted in the development of safer candidates, with more specific effects on limited cell types, and this trend will continue [45]. Improvements in genetic engineering approaches, including the approach of 'reverse genetics', now enable the production of viral vectors with predetermined genetic defects, which should improve their safety. In addition, the development of non-replicating viral vectors (e.g. alphaviruses) will result in improvements in safety over the traditional approaches [47]. At present, the biggest problem for vaccine safety worldwide is the inappropriate reuse of needles in developing countries, which results in infection with blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, important developments in the use of auto-disposable syringes and in needle-free vaccine-delivery systems will minimize these problems [5]. Overall, the increasing use of postlicensure safety studies (often called Phase IV studies) for new vaccine products will ensure that safety issues that arise even at low levels will be identified quickly, as has already been demonstrated with the oral rotavirus vaccine.",

            "text": "Vaccines have been one of the most pivotal achievements in the history of public health. The elimination of smallpox in 1980 and the near-eradication of polio have been two of the most significant achievements of immunization in the last two centuries [1,2]. Globally, vaccination saves over 386 million life years and 96 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) each year, preventing approximately six million deaths [3]. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, pneumococcal pneumonia, polio, rabies, rubella, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), and smallpox are among the illnesses for which vaccines are currently available [4]. However, there is a need for more efficient vaccines for these diseases. Furthermore, despite the achievements in vaccinations, many infectious diseases worldwide, such as dengue fever, hepatitis C, and herpes, are still lacking vaccines [4]. \n\nMost of the currently available vaccines were developed using a traditional vaccinology approach. Conventional vaccinology employs two methods: (i) whole pathogen vaccines (live-attenuated and inactivated), in which the relevant protective antigens are unknown; and (ii) subunit vaccines, which primarily focus on protective antigens recognized during infection [5]. However, this vaccine development strategy is (i) time-consuming, taking 5-15 years; (ii) high-risk because the pathogen must be grown in a laboratory to identify the components suitable for vaccine development; and (iii) limited to antigens expressed in vitro [6]. Reverse vaccinology (RV) can overcome these constraints, allowing for the development of more effective and innovative vaccines [6]. \n\nRV is a promising vaccine development technique focused on identifying a subset of promising antigens from pathogen proteomes through computational analysis as the first step in developing protein subunit vaccines [6]. After this first step in identifying antigens in RV, similar to conventional vaccinology, the antigens require validation in vitro and in vivo using experimental assays to confirm their protective potential. RV was first used in 2000 to identify novel antigens for developing a vaccine, Bexsero \u00ae , against meningococcus B [6,7].",

Advancements in manufacturing technology, speed and capacity have been achieved but vaccine effectiveness remains a significant challenge. Here, we describe a novel vaccine design strategy called immune engineering in the context of H7N9 influenza vaccine development. The approach combines immunoinformatic and structure modeling methods to promote protective antibody responses against H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) by engineering whole antigens to carry seasonal influenza HA memory CD4+ T cell epitopes \u2013 without perturbing native antigen structure \u2013 by galvanizing HA-specific memory helper T cells that support sustained antibody development against the native target HA. The premise for this vaccine concept rests on (i) the significance of CD4+ T cell memory to influenza immunity, (ii) the essential role CD4+ T cells play in development of neutralizing antibodies, (iii) linked specificity of HA-derived CD4+ T cell epitopes to antibody responses, (iv) the structural plasticity of HA and (v) an illustration of improved antibody response to a prototype engineered recombinant H7-HA vaccine. Immune engineering can be applied to development of vaccines against pandemic concerns, including avian influenza, as well as other difficult targets.",

            "text": "The achievements in gene engineering have dramatically influenced the construction of vaccines. Since the 1980s, recombinant technologies have been introduced for the development of different vaccine types, such as live and attenuated recombinant bacteria and viruses, as well as the production of toxins and other protein antigens using recombinant hosts [8]. \n\nThe hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine was the first subunit vaccine, and it was generated by gene engineering techniques more than 30 years ago. The expression of a cloned copy of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in yeast cells resulted in the production of noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) [10] and allowed the replacement of a previously generated plasma-derived vaccine [11]. The success of HBV vaccines strongly stimulated the development of recombinant vaccines based on viral structural proteins and marked the beginning of a new era in rationally designed VLP platforms for the generation of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [12]. \n\nUsing the same principle of viral coat protein (CP) expression in heterologous hosts, vaccines against cervical cancer (Gardasil and Cervarix; [13-15]), hepatitis A (Hecolin; [16]) and malaria (RTS,S; [17]) were constructed, clinically tested and licensed for human use in the subsequent decades. It is important to stress that the RTS,S vaccine is the first among licensed vaccines containing a VLP carrier (HBsAg) with an incorporated foreign antigen (CS). \n\nArtificial virus-like structures derived from plant virus proteins are well known due to virus assembly studies performed since the 1950s [18]. Based on the use of carrier proteins with chemically coupled peptide antigens as promising vaccine candidates [19], Haynes et al. [20] generated an experimental vaccine using a gene engineering approach instead of chemical coupling. They combined the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) CP gene with an extension encoding a C-terminally located, 8 AA-long antigenic peptide from poliovirus. The resulting VLPs purified from recombinant bacterial cells were immunogenic and stimulated the formation of antibodies against poliovirus in rats.",

            "text": "The omics revolution, including novel bioinformatics tools for data analysis, has extended the options in vaccine research beyond empirical strategies, promising to speed up vaccine development. It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) [194][195][196][197]. Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity [197][198][199][200][201][202]. Recombinant expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. \n\nProteomes 2016, 4, 11 12 of 24 expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) [194]. With the intention of further reducing the number of microbial antigens to be examined, computer aided selection tools have been developed that draw on available information about successful vaccine antigens to deduce common features, such as chemical properties of amino acid sequences [203] or functional domains [204], and apply this knowledge to the discovery of vaccine candidates in microbial genome databases. The latter approach, termed protectome analysis, is based on the notion that protective vaccines should target bacterial virulence factors that are dangerous for the host and hence share biological functions in addition to being immunogenic [204].",

            "text": "Recent advances in systems biology-based technologies have enabled scientists to investigate the immune responses induced by pathogens and vaccines at a greater depth than ever before. More importantly, these advances are facilitating the identification of robust molecular and cellular signatures of protective immunity, which can help to generate diagnostic tools that reduce the length and cost of current clinical trials. The workflow of vaccine design using reverse vaccinology is shown. First, B cells or plasma cells can be isolated from infected or vaccinated individuals and PCR amplification of antibody gene heavy and light chains can lead to human B cell repertoire analysis, which enables the identification of protective antibodies. Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans. \n\nWhen these systems approaches are applied to EIDs, they will enable more rapid and rational design of vaccine development. Thus, in this developing field, vaccinologists, immunologists, bioinformaticians, and systems biologists must work hand-in-hand to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines induce protective immunity and help drive development of the next generation of vaccines to prevent EIDs.",

            "text": "Vaccines play a key role in protecting humans from emerging infectious diseases. Currently, in the case of COVID-19, the continuous appearance of viral mutants since the first outbreak in 2019 and breakthrough infections after vaccinations are major issues. A broad range of novel or next-generation vaccine antigens, such as mRNA, DNA, and synthetic and recombinant components, are being developed and used instead of microbial-derived components. These types of components show clear advantages over conventional classical antigens from a manufacturing and process control standpoint. As novel antigens have successfully completed clinical trials and have been approved for human use, antigens tailored to emerging infectious diseases will continue to be widely proposed. Future vaccine research requires technology that can be applied immediately to clinical and preclinical experiments, with easy production when a viral disease emerges. Nanoengineering is being applied to overcome major issues associated with recombinant protein subunit, mRNA, and DNA vaccines that have potential for clinical application. These issues include poor immunogenicity and insufficient induction of inappropriate immune responses. Nanoparticulate vaccines are primarily being developed to safely deliver antigens to APCs and to maximize immune activity by protecting against proteolysis in the physiological environment. Nanoplatforms can be optimally engineered for various molecules and specific antigens by modulating the physicochemical properties of their components or by presenting multimeric forms conjugated or formulated with immune potentiators. Further, it is important to develop systems that use antigens and molecules encapsulated within NPs to deliver them to the desired location with appropriate timing; it is also important to ensure tightly controlled release kinetics. Consequently, nanoengineered vaccines have great potential to be a flexible platform and provide novel strategies for the development of the next generation of vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccinology as a scientifi c fi eld is undergoing dramatic development. Sophisticated techniques and rapidly growing in-depth knowledge of immunological mechanisms are at hand to exploit fully the potential for protecting from, as well as curing of diseases through vaccination. In spite of great successes like eradication of smallpox in the 1970s and in a lesser extent poliomyelitis (two important milestones in medical history), new challenges have arisen to be faced. Rapidly changing ecosystems and human behaviour, an ever-increasing density of human and farmed animal populations, a high degree of mobility resulting in rapid spreading of pathogens in infected people and animals, poverty and war confl icts in the third world, and many other factors contribute to the more frequent occurrence and rapid dissemination of new as well as some old infectious disease. \n\nThe three infections that most heavily affl ict global health are AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. As an example of new viral pathogens, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, or new strains of infl uenza virus can be mentioned [ 1 ]. Rapid sequencing of the genome of pathogens leads to development of sensitive molecular diagnostic tools and augments identifi cation and expression of recombinant antigenic targets for future vaccines [ 2 ]. Special fi eld represents immunotherapy of cancer, where anticancer vaccines could be a powerful weapon for long-term effective treatment. \n\nThe progress in vaccine development is tightly connected not only with new fi ndings in immunology but also in molecular biology and biotechnology. The new term \"reverse vaccinology\" was proposed by Rappuoli to describe a complex genome-based approach toward vaccine design [ 3 ]. In comparison with conventional approaches which require a laborious process of attenuation or inactivation of pathogens, or selection of individual components important for induction of immune response, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility of using genomic information derived from in silico analyses for direct design and production of protective antigen using recombinant technology.",

            "text": "Hence, designing a vaccine against HCPS is the challenge to global health to tackle Sin Nombre orthohantavirus infection. There is no effective and FDA-approved vaccine against SNV; however, many attempts have been made to develop effective vaccines, including conventional, molecular approaches, subunit, and plasmid DNA delivery by gene gun. All these approaches end without any positive progress. Multi-epitope-based vaccines have precedence over traditional vaccinology because of their highly distinctive features, including safety, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservancy, cheapness, and being less arduous (6). \n\nA safe and effective vaccine was discovered by Sabin and Salk against poliovirus using Pasteur's vaccinology approach. Pasteur's vaccinology role led to the formulation of the BCG vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nonetheless, such a vaccinology technique fails for numerous bacterial diseases that cannot be cultivated on culture media. Moreover, culture-based vaccines reveal antigenic unevenness mainly in the case of Neisseria meningitides. Currently, bioinformatics and reverse vaccinology approaches are used to predict highly conserved as well as immunodominant peptide epitopes from the epitopes databases (7). This provides a platform for the development of multi-antigenic epitope-based vaccines against several bacterial pathogens. The modern research in immunology and vaccinology is excellently contributed to by immunoinformatics. Several studies worked on designing extracellular vesicle-based vaccines that have higher biosafety and efficiency in triggering an immune response. In general, a good vaccine candidate must have properties to trigger a specific B cell cytotoxic T cell response in the host body (8). Several databases collect experimentally verified vaccines and vaccine components, while in silico tools provide computational methods to predict and design new vaccines and vaccine components (8). This study was designed to develop a genome based vaccine against SNV using several reverse vaccinology, bioinformatics, immmunoinformatics, and biophysical approaches.",

Moreover, it has been used on several other bacterial vaccines such as antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [2]. \n\nReverse vaccinology have changed the concepts and approaches for vaccine candidate selection and design. Genome investigation and selection of antigens provide a new way to study the pathogenesis mechanisms. The resulting lists of novel candidates which reveal new aspects of pathogenesis will promote the rational design of optimal vaccine antigens.

            "text": "These vaccines were developed using Pasteur's principles and became landmarks and tools that led to the control and elimination of some of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Despite their success, vaccine development takes time for those noncultivable pathogens or the ones where there is not an obvious antigen or structure to use as a candidate for a vaccine. On top of the former, variation between individuals in vaccine responses remains a complex trait that needs further attention given that a high proportion of vaccinated individuals lack complete protection after routine immunizations [26]. \n\nFinalizing the 20th century, technologies to develop vaccines were coming to an overuse since all plausible vaccines to develop were described already; the field needed new approaches to counteract the problematic pathogens at hand. Then, the introduction of newly develop technologies -such as recombinant DNA and chemical conjugation of proteins to be used as new adjuvants -leveled the field to keep going forward. By 1995, Craig Venter published the first draft genome of a microorganism [9]. This led the way to initiate a technological revolution allowing to use computational approaches to design vaccines by extracting the information from the genomic information without even growing the pathogen, this is known as \"reverse vaccinology\" [27]. \n\nReverse vaccinology serves to develop protein-based vaccines and has been applied to many bacterial pathogens. The first pathogen tackled was group B streptococcus which by using eight available genomes, allowed the expression of 312 candidate antigens and the development of a vaccine based on four proteins able to protect against all serotypes [27]. For group A streptococcus another vaccine was developed by cross-matching homology to make sure the selected antigens for the vaccine differed from human encoded proteins. By using the entire protein repertoire of a pathogen, reverse vaccinology selects the best antigen vaccine candidates, to confection new candidate vaccines that can lead to the discovery of unique antigens that may improve existing vaccines. A parallel between conventional and reverse vaccinology is presented on (Table 2).",

            "text": "Detection of antibodies against infectious agents is an important part of basic and clinical research. For clinical diagnosis, the detection of antibody responses to some pathogens provides a sensitive assay for current, as well as past, infections. Antibody responses are also used to evaluate specific clinical symptoms associated with some pathogens. In vaccine research, antibody titers to specific proteins of an infectious agent often correlate strongly with the extent of protection afforded by the vaccine. Identifying protective B-cell responses against antigens, particularly against conformational epitopes that provide broad-spectrum protection against a given infection, are also critical for vaccine development and monitoring. The identification of antigens that induce the most effective immune response and which are the most diagnostically useful can be a daunting task. Improved approaches to increase both the spectrum of antigens tested and the quality of humoral responses detected has tremendous potential for many of these types of studies. \n\nAlthough routine detection of antibodies is generally performed one antigen at a time by ELISA, there is increasing interest in studying antibody responses to whole proteomes for some infectious agents. While the availability of full genomic DNA sequences to many infectious agents has provided a framework to systematically identify antigenic targets, significant challenges remain to study antibody responses to Analyses of humoral responses against different infectious agents are critical for infectious disease diagnostics, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and the development and monitoring of vaccines. While ELISAs are often used to measure antibody responses to one or several targets, new antibody-profiling technologies, such as protein microarrays, can now evaluate antibody responses to hundreds, or even thousands, of recombinant antigens at one time. These large-scale studies have uncovered new antigenic targets, provided new insights into vaccine research and yielded an overview of immunoreactivity against almost the entire proteome of certain pathogens. However, solid-phase antigen arrays also have drawbacks that limit the type of information obtained, including suboptimal detection of conformational epitopes, high backgrounds due to impure antigens and a narrow dynamic range of detection. We have developed a solution-phase antibody-profiling technology, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), which harnesses light-emitting recombinant antigen fusion proteins to quantitatively measure patient antibody titers.",

            "title": "Vaccines: From Empirical Development to Rational Design",
            "text": "In this review we elaborate on recent achievements that facilitate rational vaccine design. There are many visions on the expected impact of reverse vaccinology, epitope prediction, structural vaccinology, systems vaccinology, and personalized medicine on the rational design of effective vaccines [3,5,6,106]. However, the implementation of these concepts towards the development of new and more potent vaccines requires time and considerable financial investment. Rational vaccine design will rely strongly on the availability of clinical data on individuals with different clinical forms of disease or response to vaccination to learn what is needed for protection [107]. The gaps in knowledge on the immune system's specific clearance mechanisms against many pathogens slow down the identification of the immune response that should be evoked by tailored vaccines in different population groups (Table 1). Many aspects of the host pathogen interaction and host immune status during persistent infection are also poorly understood, thereby hindering the development of therapeutic vaccines [108]. Further data from trials with empiric formulations are required to identify patterns or biomarkers that can reliably guide prediction of vaccine efficacy and safety at reasonable success rates (Figure 1). A widely accepted goal in vaccine development is the applicability to huge populations, if not all humankind. Nevertheless, there are reasons for more personalized approaches that consider specific preconditions in recipients, such as genetic background, pre-exposure to pathogens or vaccines, unique physiological background related to local culture/habits, age, and immunodeficiency.\n\nImplementation of rational development concepts in vaccinology demands patience, and advances will be incremental. Realization will depend on the application of flanking logistic and regulatory measures and the awareness of the strong impact of vaccine development to solve global health problems. Funding is also required for the basic research needed to provide the basis for rationally developed vaccines. However, we expect to see the advent of new and more efficient vaccines in the coming years as a result of the implementation of this emerging knowledge and enabling technologies.",

It is clear that vaccines form the most powerful and cost-effective prophylactic therapy for infectious disease. Vaccines work to militate against the effects of subsequent infection as well as blocking the ability of a pathogen to kill its host. The availability of entire genomes corresponding to many important pathogens has instigated a new research initiative able to discover a wide array of antigens, which can act as potential vaccine candidates. Bioinformatics, in the form of comprehensive immunological databases and analysis tools, has hastened both the identification and the validation of candidate vaccines. \n\nPreviously, the principal means of antigen discovery was empirical. A live, virulent pathogen, for example, is now considered a poor candidate vaccine since despite its potent immunogenicity it is more liable to induce disease than to prevent or treat it. Thus, vaccines have, until recently, been primarily attenuated or chemically inactivated whole pathogen vaccines such as Sabin's polio vaccine or BCG. More recently, safety concerns have fostered alternate strategies for vaccine development. \n\nThe most successful has focused on the antigen, acellular or subunit vaccine, which includes recombinant vaccines against hepatitis B, human papillomavirus and Haemophilus influenzae B. Subunit vaccines are typically composed of immunogenic protein or carbohydrate, such as cell wall components, or a bio-conjugated combination of both. Many antigens are highly immunogenic, while others stimulate measurable yet often weak responses, requiring boosting to perpetuate long-term protection and the addition of adjuvants (1)(2)(3). \n\nAntigen-based subunit vaccines long ago became a prime focus on vaccine discovery. Approaches to the identification of antigens include the identification of immunodominant epitopes, assaying for enhanced correlates of protection such as antibody levels and cytokine production and testing for enhanced survival in disease challenge models.",

            "text": "These components first emerged in the first jawed fish, which include cartilaginous and teleost fish [30]. \n\nVaccination stands as a cornerstone in the defence against pathogenic organisms, contributing significantly to the sustainability of aquaculture, as emphasized by [31]. Today's vaccine technology is very precise, focusing on specific pathogenic parts. This is usually done by using subunit or recombinant DNA/RNA particle vaccines [32]. These vaccines centre on the production of antigens, substances that trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses, a fundamental defence mechanism that guards organisms against pathogenic invaders. Notably, the role of certain pathogenic components, like the major capsid protein (MCP), has become more important in the development of vaccines because of how they cause diseases. For example, in viral erythrocytic necrosis (VEN), the virus needs the MCP to get into the host cell. This makes it a great target for lowering the costs of the disease [33]. Furthermore, the major capsid protein of Grouper Iridovirus, as identified by [34], has been recognised not only as a potential biomarker for infected cells but also as a pivotal element in the development of effective vaccines. The field of immunoinformatics uses prediction tools for many immunobiotechnology and immunomics processes to make vaccines, kits, and biological products that help treat cancer, allergies, and infectious diseases [35]. The use of bioinformatics can help in dangerous substance detection, tissue transplantation ease, and MHC genotyping. Furthermore, bioinformatics enables a better understanding of the functions and interactions of toll-like receptors (TLRs). The first example of such a procedure is reverse vaccinology. Reverse Vaccinology (RV) is a powerful and novel in silico vaccine design approach that overcomes the limitations of current vaccinology methods. It involves a computational-based analysis called subtractive genomics, which is used to prioritise drug targets and vaccine candidates [36].

            "text": "However, the development of next-generation vaccines capable of providing broad protection against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and VOCs presents a promising strategy. This would involve the use of reverse vaccinology approaches that utilize in silico immunoinformatic approaches to identify highly conserved epitopes, which could be validated for their potent immunogenicity through immunizations in mice or non-human primates. \n\nAccelerated developments in next-generation vaccine platforms showed that recombinant protein, mRNA, and DNA vaccines have advantages over traditional LAVs and IVs that utilize whole viruses. mRNA vaccines have demonstrated highly immunogenic responses that provide a high level (>94%) of immune protection against symptomatic and severe infections prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant. The mRNA platform as well as the DNA platform would allow newly validated epitope sequences to be easily incorporated through the inclusion of new gene sequences. These newly modified mRNA or DNA vaccines could be considered for development as vaccine booster doses to prevent re-infections by the WT (Wuhan) strain or by VOCs. Since mRNA vaccines require strong logistics to control their transport and storage requirements, which might hamper their usefulness and availability, DNA vaccines could offer convenience in storage and accessibility for developing countries that lack sufficient infrastructure. While recombinant protein vaccines might require extensive purification steps, they have been shown to elicit potent immune responses upon administration, and the technology of production is more amenable to low-income countries. The development of recombinant protein or peptidebased COVID-19 vaccines might set the stage for further enhancement of this platform, as the antigens encoded by the plasmid would not contain potentially harmful components, thus maintaining a stellar safety profile [97]. This trait of being able to modify the design of the DNA or recombinant peptide vaccines is of particular interest due to the benefits it entails in terms of rapidly emerging VOCs that necessitate accelerated modifications to existing antigenic sequences included in currently approved vaccines. This indicated that the antigens, once validated, might be readily incorporated in multi-epitope recombinant protein, mRNA or DNA vaccines.",

For developing a novel vaccine construct for the monkeypox virus, computational studies-based vaccine design can be used by researchers and scientists to experimentally test against the monkeypox pathogen [13][14][15][16]. The multi-epitope vaccine design works with genetic information and makes use of a series of filters that are based on experimental data in order to select the antigenic epitopes that are most suitable for testing in experimental settings [17][18][19][20]. In this specific investigation, subtractive proteomics and reverse vaccinology methods were applied with the purpose of locating vaccine antigenic epitopes that were viable for application in the construction of a chimeric vaccine. These epitopes were ultimately put to use in the vaccine. As a result, we have reason to expect that the findings of this study could be of value to experimentalists in the process of developing an effective vaccine against the monkeypox virus.",

            "text": "the integrated drug information system (https://nedrug. mfds.go.kr), respectively. \n\nVaccine manufacturing technology has been continuously developed as a solution to prevent infectious diseases. A vaccine platform refers to a technology for vaccine development by changing specific antigens or genetic information. A single vaccine platform commonly addresses a specific pathogen. However, the COVID-19 pandemic yielded a competitive situation, wherein various platforms were used to develop new vaccines with the goal of rapidly obtaining an effective vaccine. Currently, COVID-19 vaccine platform modalities include inactivated virus vaccines, attenuated virus vaccines, recombinant viral vector vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and RNA vaccines [12,13]. As of December 3, 2021, there are 135 candidates in the clinical phase of development, of which vaccines using protein subunits accounted for 34.8% (n = 47), RNA vaccines accounted for 15.6% (n = 21), and viral vectors (non-replicating) accounted for 14.8% (n = 20) (Table 3) [14]. \n\nSince the manufacturing technology and quality control processes required for each platform are novel and unique, the establishment of test methods is time-consuming. Furthermore, each vaccine platform has advantages and drawbacks, including differences in production, efficacy, safety profile, and immune response. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the characteristics of every vaccine candidate and the specific quality considerations for each platform [12]. If new technology platform development guidelines are provided for use in quality control and testing, the vaccine development timeline could be significantly shortened. Accordingly, the NIFDS published 2 national lot release guidelines for new technology platforms for COVID-19 vaccines (viral vector vaccines and mRNA vaccines) by referring to the approval and review data of COVID-19 vaccines by the MFDS, WHO, and European Medicines Quality Committee (EDQM) guidelines [15,16]. \n\nViral vector vaccines are defined as live viruses that are genetically engineered to express 1 or more heterologous antigens [17]. Recombinant viral vector vaccines are generated by cloning the gene for an antigen from the pathogen into an avirulent host such as an adenovirus. Viral vector vaccines enter cells and produce the vaccine antigen, stimulating an immune response.",

            "text": "While antibody therapeutics are responsible for passive immunization, a vaccine is defined as a preparation capable of stimulating an active immune response in the host. Active immunity includes both the humoral response (antibodymediated) and the cellular-mediated immune response. 96 The ideal vaccine should cause a prolonged neutralizing immune response in the host and is composed of an antigen complemented with adjuvants. \n\nTraditional vaccine discovery approaches relied on the direct investigation of pathogen components hypothesized to have a role in eliciting responses to identify protective antigens. This approach has led to the development of many lifesaving vaccines but has shown limitations in targeting infectious diseases or other pathologies characterized by immune evasion mechanisms. Examples are HIV, influenza, or malaria pathogens whose surface proteins elicit extreme sequence variation or are shielded by glycans (HIV, hepatitis C). The search for anticancer vaccines, a hot field of study at the moment, may also need different approaches. 97,98 n 2000 99 Rappuoli and colleagues spurred a dramatic change in the field by introducing the paradigm of Reverse Vaccinology, which has led to the development of a vaccine against meningococcus B. Taking advantage of whole genome sequencing, possible antigenic species are sorted out with the aid of immuno-bioinformatics tools, subject to different criteria such as surface exposition, conservation, toxicity, and allergenicity. The most promising species are then screened experimentally for their immunogenic activity. More recently, the term Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 has been coined to refer to the advancements brought to the field by the analysis of human protective antibodies, sequencing and cloning of B-cell repertoires together with structural characterization of antigens and epitopes. 97,100 The investigation of effective antibody response allows the identification of promising corresponding antigens/epitopes. \n\nVarious open-source tools for complete RV workflows have been designed mainly for bacterial antigen discovery. They can be classified in filtering based methods such as Vaxign, 101 NERVE, 102 Jenner-predict, 103 and VacSol, 104 or machine learning-based methods including VaxiJen, 105 Vacceed, 106 Vaxign-ML, 107 and the Bowman-Heinson 108,109 method.",

The term 'synthetic vaccinology' is applied when sequencing data alone are sufficient to rapidly initiate vaccine antigen design and the production of key reagents 33 (Fig. 2). Advances in atomic-level protein engineering 10,34,35 , understanding of the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) [36][37][38] and the identification of other self-assembling molecules that improve immunogenicity by optimizing antigen display [39][40][41] facilitate the fine tuning of vaccineinduced immune responses to specific antigenic targets. \n\nAccelerating the development and evaluation of vaccines will require new investments and international cooperation. Platform technologies that take advantage of delivery approaches with an established manufacturing process or that have a substantial pre-existing safety database in humans could shorten the timeline for manufacture by having uniform 'Chemical, Manufacturing, and Controls' sections for investigational new drug applications and by accelerating preclinical toxicology testing [42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] (Fig. 1). This is a major focus of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation and the new concepts of the Biodefense Preparedness Organizations mentioned above, which indicates that the need is being recognized and an infrastructure for investment is being established. It is likely that multiple distinct platform vaccine technologies will be needed to address the diversity of viral pathogens and disease manifestations. In addition to the process of putting product in a vial, there is a need for improved communication and cooperation across borders to accelerate regulatory review of new products. Organizations like the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum should be expanded across the globe so that products can enter efficacy evaluation more rapidly in the midst of a crisis.",

            "text": "Recombinant vaccines have well-identified theoretical advantages over conventional live vaccines. Yet, recombinant vaccines remain scarce. Vaccine against hepatitis B is one of them. A vaccine against RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus) is also used to vaccinate rabbits. An efficient vaccine against poultry Newcastle disease has been prepared in transgenic plant and approved but not put on the market so far [118]. No more than four plantderived recombinant vaccines have reached clinical development [20]. The vaccine against malaria produced in goat milk is under clinical study whereas the vaccine anti-rotavirus produced in rabbit milk is under preclinical study. \n\nIdentifying a relevant antigen capable of becoming efficient is the result of a relatively long-term study. Yet, such antigens have been characterized and could be prepared. Validating a mode of administration and determining the valuable adjuvant require specific studies on animal models. Such models are not always relevant. Mice are most frequently used species for this purpose. These animals often give only limited information. Infection by rotavirus is not followed by diarrheas. Other species not so easily used such as pigs or monkeys are then required. \n\nThe different systems for the production of recombinant vaccines have been markedly improved during the last decades. Additional progress is expected but the state of the art in this field is no more a hurdle. About 475,000 l of animal cell fermentors are available and could contribute more extensively to the production of recombinant vaccines. Production in the yeast Pichia pastoris is getting more and more efficient and reliable. \n\nTransgenic plants are still facing important problems. The production level remains often low. The glycosylation problem is not expected to be solved in a near future and the uncontrolled dissemination of antigens may not find solution other than the implementation of confined areas. The only marketed proteins produced in plants are enzymes for industrial applications. Two proteins only are under clinical study, dog lipase for patients suffering from cystic fibrosis and a monoclonal antibody directed against Streptococcus mutans and preventing tooth decay [118] and none of them has been approved yet. \n\nThe production in milk is the most mature system and is available to produce reliable recombinant vaccines at a low cost.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology (RV), a genome-based vaccine development pipeline, has contributed considerably to the identification of new vaccine candidates [8]. RV is pioneered by Dr. Rino Rappuoli and has revolutionized the vaccine development pipeline, particularly against pathogens for which Pasteur's principles of vaccinology have failed [10]. RV has been effectively used in meningococci serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) development [11]. In the recent past, a recombinant chimeric peptide vaccine was designed in silico and evaluated experimentally to show 50% protection in hamsters against the infection [12]. Moreover, due to genomic diversity in bacterial pathogens, classical RV has been modified to pan-genomic based RV (PGRV) [13] to identify core proteome antigens. In the recent past, PGRV successfully mapped four protective antigens in Streptococcus agalactiae genomes [14]. \n\nThis work involves core genomics, subtractive proteomics, and RV in combination with biophysical approaches to construct a multi-epitope vaccine and to decipher its binding potential with host immune system components as well as evaluate its potential in providing immune protection against M. morganii. M. morganii belongs to the family of Enterobacteriaceae and causes nosocomial infections, especially urinary tract and wound infections [15]. Some strains of the pathogen are resistant to oxacillin, penicillin, first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins, ampicillin/sulbactam, macrolides, fosfomycin, colistin, lincosamides, and polymyxin B [15]. In addition to this AR spectrum exhibited by M. morganii, there is no vaccine in development for the pathogen which may make the situation worse while treating these infections. Hence, substantial efforts are required to screen protective antigens from the pathogen genome that can be subjected easily to experimental evaluations. This in turn will save time and reduce the costs that usually go into the experimental vaccine candidate's prioritization.",

            "text": "A vaccine discovery process called reverse vaccinology has been efficiently adopted for bacterial pathogens that have a high degree of antigen variability and circulate in multiple strains (Sette and Rappuoli, 2010). In summary, genomic information of multiple strains has been used to select surface-exposed antigens that are more conserved. In silico selected antigens have then been expressed as recombinant proteins and used to immunize mice. The antigens that gave the best bactericidal anti-body responses or -in the absence of a correlate of protection -the best survival rate in animal challenge studies have been selected for prototype vaccines. This approach has been adopted for the development of a vaccine that was able to prevent infection by most Men B strains in mice (Giuliani et al., 2006). The preclinical results were confirmed by clinical trials in adults and infants and a licence application has been recently submitted in Europe (Findlow et al., 2010;Snape et al., 2010). The same approach has been adopted for the development of a vaccine able to protect all circulating strains of GBS . In most of the cases the antigens identified by reverse vaccinology were unknown and their characterization has often helped to understand the biology of the pathogen. For example, a protective antigen identified by reverse vaccinology in GAS was found to be the component of a previously unknown pilus-like structure mediating bacterial adhesion to host cells (Lauer et al., 2005). In the future, reverse vaccinology can be applied to generate universal proteinbased vaccines against variable pathogens such as GAS, S. pneumoniae and pathogenic E. coli strains.",

            "text": "Vaccine development is in demand due to the increasing rate of mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 infection. Vaccines play an important role in the reduction of toxicity and the elimination of diseases (Dubey et al., 2018;Amanat and Krammer, 2020). The conventional technologies of vaccine designed have many limitations, including time consumption, laborious, costly, and many more. Perhaps somehow, the involvement of in silico tools is sufficient to overcome the mentioned limitations (Rauch et al., 2018). Immunoinformatics approach like reverse vaccinology, epitope prediction, rational vaccinology, and structural vaccinology is advantageous to be used for the designing of vaccines (Kazi et al., 2018). Moreover, side chain and backbone modeling are significant in designing the antibody structure to act as vaccine target. SCWRL and SCAP are the in silico tools used to identify the mutation in the proteins (He et al., 2015). RAMBLE and RAPER are the additional software applied for side chain prediction analysis. Multivant scaffolding is another tool applied for the designing of potential epitope (He et al., 2015). However, an epitope can be grafted by using multigraft interface technology. ORF-FINDER, GS FINDER, and GLIMMER are some of the in silico tools that performed the screening of ORFs and selected the most immunogenic peptide that alternatively help in vaccine designing (Davies and Darren, 2007). \n\nStructural biology is an important area of immunoinformatics and the basis for the structure of proteins. On the basis of structure, rational vaccinology analyzes the structure of novel protein antigens that will be targeted as potential vaccine candidates (Hegde et al., 2018). Rational technology of vaccine design was significantly used against viral pathogens like influenza, HIV (Van Regenmortel, 2019) and Hepatitis C (He and Zhu, 2015). Furthermore, approaching systems biology enhances the understanding of host-pathogen interaction and also develops adjuvant that provides long-lasting immunity. Vaxijen is another important computation tool that contributes to vaccine development.",

            "text": "The advent of the genome era and the tremendous advances in immunological and bioinformatics tools have enabled the reverse vaccinology approach (RV) as a new effective strategy for lead antigen identification in vaccine development (73)(74)(75). One of the advantages of the RV approach is that every antigen encoded in the worm genome can be screened in silico to determine its ability to induce an immune response (31,74). Thus, it can overcome some of the limitations of conventional methods of screening vaccine candidates (76)(77)(78). Antigen selection can also be carefully prescribed based on clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, Zawawi et al. employed a systematic, multi-stage process to identify Trichuris epitope vaccine antigens based on the RV approach (79). The epitopes were identified from secreted, and surface-exposed proteins and any protein with any degree of homology to humans or mice were excluded to eliminate potential autoimmune reactions. Most of the identified vaccine antigens were stage-specific and had essential functions in the parasite biological process, associated with host-parasite interaction, parasite metabolism, development and fecundity (80).",

            "text": "Some of the vaccine technologies have been pivotal in identifying vaccine candidates. Outer membrane vesicle vaccine (OMV) developed under the umbrella of generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) technology [86], DNA and RNA vaccines [87], and bioconjugates technology [88] are proving to be vital in vaccine design targeting various priority pathogens. Reverse and structural vaccinology [89,90] have also been harnessed to predict conserved surfaceexposed factors that could serve as vaccine targets. Other technology platforms for the production of custom-made recombinant glycoconjugate vaccines are also available [77]. Despite all these successes, we still need a continuous pipeline of vaccines with different technologies. The old traditional approach (live attenuated vaccines) has also witnessed some critical and valuable innovations [78]. While we celebrate the success so far, more antigenic components need to be identified by leveraging next-generation technology. For example, Mark Stevens and collaborators have recently used transposon mutagenesis incorporated with sequencing to identify hundreds of candidate genes for vaccine targets. \n\nDifferent vaccines are being developed against different pathogens, including multi-protective poultry vaccines. CVD1902, a live attenuated vaccine, is also being tested against Salmonella paratyphi A [91]. \n\nSequencing technologies integrated with scalable downstream bioinformatic analysis have also been pivotal in identifying bacterial antigens to further mitigate infection due to Salmonella. This approach was recently used to screen the entire Salmonella genome and nucleotide identity. Approximately 3,300 conserved S. enterica genes were mapped. After subtracting >50 % nucleotide identity from other bacteria, the researchers, through this approach, were able to identify ApeE, a gene belonging to the GDSL lipase family. This gene (required for gall bladder colonization) is conserved in Salmonella but absent in other Enterobacteriaceae. Immunization with ApeE (purified protein) protects mice from Salmonella and reduces gall bladder colonization. However, the number of conserved Salmonella antigens is still limited. \n\nDespite the promise of vaccines, there are still some gaps in the use of vaccination to reduce the burden of AMR. Only a few pathogens are in scope for vaccine development.",

These have included conventional inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, recombinant vaccines, synthetic peptide vaccines, virus-like particle-based vaccines, DNA and mRNA-based vaccines, and subunit vaccines containing purified SARS-CoV-2 S1 and/or S2 immunogenic viral proteins. The latter are considered to be some of the safest and most stable products free from additional ballast proteins and nucleic acids capable of causing adverse reactions. In their study of a candidate RBD homodimeric vaccine, Chinese researchers found that a high titer of antibodies in rodents and rhesus monkeys developed after three vaccinations. In this study, mice developed specific antibodies after the second vaccination (on day 28) [34]. \n\nA decisive role in the fight against infectious diseases is given to specific preventions using various vaccines. Research on creating new-generation vaccines against the coronavirus infection COVID-19 is critically important for the healthcare system of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Multiple vaccines are being developed around the world to this day. However, before mass vaccination can begin, all vaccines must be shown to be safe and effective in large-scale clinical trials. The latest achievement in molecular biology, genetic engineering, and biotechnology has been the creation of vaccines containing highly immunogenic viral proteins. Vaccines based on recombinant proteins are the newest generation of preventive drugs. The development of vaccinology makes it possible to use new technologies in the development of vaccines. This is a recombinant subunit vaccine technology. Vaccine development research began with the selection of immunogenic viral proteins. \n\nSeveral viral antigens are used to create experimental vaccines. The focus is on the surface protein S because of its vital role in infectious activity. In addition, nucleocapsid protein N, envelope protein E, or nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16) are used as a source of antigens.",

With currently up to 300 million affected people, malaria continues to be one of the major burdens on public health in many tropical countries.\n\nBecause of the spread of drug-resistant parasites and the appearance of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, the development of an effective vaccine against the most severe form of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is an urgent priority. Increased travel to endemic regions and the rapid development of parasite strains resistant to current prophylactic drugs have further increased demand for efficacious products.\n\nSince cultivation of malaria parasites on a sufficiently large scale has turned out to be not practical for mass vaccination, efforts in malaria vaccinology are currently focused on the development of a subunit vaccine. Although a number of vaccine candidate antigens have been identified, clinical trials with first vaccine formulations including recombinant viruses, DNA vaccines and adjuvanted recombinant malaria proteins, fusion proteins and synthetic peptides, have met only limited success. Since no vaccine against malaria or against another parasitic disease for use in humans is currently available, there is the belief that for the development of such vaccines innovative approaches and technologies are required. The proposed product and technology development project represents a highly innovative approach for subunit vaccine design.",

The implication is that one bNAb specificity will most likely not be enough to induce broad protection, and an effective HIV-1 vaccine will need to induce multiple neutralizing specificities. \n\nEnv protein structures are playing an increasingly important role in vaccine design efforts. Resolving protein structures at the atomic level is necessary to define the surfaces that are accessible for the immune system, to determine sites that are targeted by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), to design immunogens that mimic the proteins found on viral surfaces and to stabilize the desirable conformations [24]. This approach follows from \"reverse vaccinology\" in which complete genome sequencing of a pathogen is used to select for surfaceexpressed proteins to be used in a vaccine [25]. The term \"reverse vaccinology\" was repurposed in 2002 to describe the utilization of antibodies to select or design antigens with the appropriate binding properties [26]. A next iteration, \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" involves the use of antibodies and highresolution structures for the design of vaccine antigens [27]. \n\nWhile these concepts are widely applied in the HIV-1 vaccine design field, such structure-based vaccine design approaches also accelerated the development of novel vaccines against other pathogens. An example includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for which vaccine development was accelerated when the crystal structure of the pre-fusion F glycoprotein was resolved, using the D25 neutralizing antibody (NAb) specific for the pre-fusion form [28,29]. Similar to HIV-1 Env and other class I viral fusion proteins, the RSV F glycoprotein is very unstable and transitions very easily to its postfusion conformation. The apex targeting D25 MAb stabilized the F glycoprotein in its pre-fusion conformation, resulting in the high-resolution pre-fusion structure of the protein. This structure allowed for the development of a recombinant prefusion-stabilized F glycoprotein [24,28].",

            "text": "The biophysical, biochemical, and genetic engineering technologies needed for structural vaccinology are sophisticated, but the concept is simple: first, study the native molecular architecture of neutralization determinants; and then, use this knowledge to modify the molecules and engineer immunogens that are optimally designed for inclusion in protective vaccines. Success of structural vaccinology will require the application of high throughput methods to generate a large number of antigenic structures and assays to predict their effectiveness as immunogens. With current knowledge, we can already optimize protein antigens for efficient production, conformational homogeneity, and stable storage. However, fully realizing the potential of structure based design of vaccine antigens will require longer-term basic research into the structural determinants of immunodominance and immunogenicity. This research must take into account the diversity of the antibody repertoire generated not only in a single individual, but also in those of different genetic backgrounds and histories of antigen exposure. New techniques, such sorting IgG + antibody secreting plasma cells to rapidly clone human monoclonal antibodies specific for a recent immunogen [69], make such analyses feasible. \n\nThe application of structural insight to vaccine design is especially important for new vaccines against viral pathogens. The greater number of protective determinants of bacteria, fungi, and parasites make them suitable for a reverse vaccinology approach to discovering protective determinants with favorable vaccine antigen characteristics [6]. The limited number of protective determinants on most viruses necessitates optimizing a relatively small set of macromolecules. Antigen optimization is not limited to subunit vaccines. Live attenuated, vectored, and viruslike-particle vaccines could also incorporate antigens that have been optimized based on structural insights. Matching the rational design of antigens to advances in the rational design of adjuvants can enable a new generation of vaccines that are more safe, broadly protective, practical, and affordable than those available today.",

            "text": "A number of potential practical and scientific concerns are associated with subunit vaccine production. For example, the production of recombinant full length envelope proteins, such as gB and gH, may be incompatible with large-scale production with a cost-effective process, which may turn a vaccine candidate economically and operationally unviable. Another aspect to consider is that for subunit vaccines utilizing either gB or gH, there is a reliance on the recombinant expression of truncated forms associated with adjuvants, or the use of viral vectors coding for such antigens. For the latter, a number of viral vector candidates have been tested with contrasting results, ranging from no humoral immunity to both neutralizing antibody and T cell responses. These illustrate the nature of the vector delivering the antigen is just as important as the antigen itself and is reviewed [40]. For the former, truncated or modified proteins tested to date have been unable to offer sufficient protection to achieve licensure. One possibility is that the truncation impacts on the correct induction of conformational antibodies and/or hide antigenic domains, reducing the efficacy of the vaccine against the target in the actual pathogen. Put simply, the end-point in any vaccine design process is not the generation of a potent response against the vaccine, but, of course, a vaccine-induced response that neutralizes hCMV infection. That said, it is likely that within the humoral response against viral proteins, there are specific responses that are protective and the identification of such a subset of responses against specific epitopes will be an important driver of future vaccine studies and may mitigate some of the issues associated with the production of full length recombinant proteins. \n\nThe identification of specific epitopes responsible for protective antibody responses will likely underpin future iterations of a gB based vaccine. Analyses of the natural humoral response to gB protein have established that at least five main antigenic domains (AD), named AD-1 to AD-5, exist.",

            "text": "Despite the presence of reverse genetics systems for many human pathogens, not all have resulted in successful vaccine platforms. Advances in biotechnology and key discoveries have led to novel reverse genetic approaches, which may be employed in new generation vaccines. Structural vaccinology or structure-based antigen design has become a common practice for optimizing antigens for display in vaccines [135]. As mentioned previously, RSV remains a key hurdle to reducing viral childhood morbidity. Since the discovery and implementation of palivizumab, currently the only licensed prophalytic inhibitory measure to RSV infection, considerable energy has been devoted to evaluating the antigenic sites of the RSV fusion (F) protein and optimizing F expression constructs for higher immunogenicity [105]. Current structural vaccinology efforts to evaluate the pre-fusion and post-fusion antigenic forms of RSV F protein have led to the induction and identification of potent neutralizing antibodies with higher neutralizing potencies than palivizumab [136,137]. The availability of new structures and sequences has made predictive structural modeling and structure-based antigen design viable options for renewed efforts at design of vaccines, for which no current vaccines exist.\n\nAdvances in biotechnology have shaped the field of virology as much as any other field of science. The capacity to engineer reverse genetics platforms for the study and manipulation of RNA virus genomes has revolutionized the field of vaccine design. We have described here RNA virus reverse genetic systems and past and current efforts to develop vaccines to provide immunity to several human RNA virus pathogens. The incorporation of new advances in reverse genetics technology, adjuvants, non-human models of infection, and surveillance will continue to drive the development of next generation vaccines to pathogens for which we already have vaccination strategies as well as those that we currently do not. Ongoing changes in human demographics and accessibility to health care are likely to modify cost-benefit analyses and provoke allocation of new resources for scientific study and development of vaccines. Despite the ongoing evolution of vaccine design and implementation, the hallmarks of an effective viral vaccine will remain the same: high efficacy, safety, and stability.",

            "text": "Most currently used adjuvants have been empirically discovered with little knowledge about their mechanism of action or possible side effects. Recent advances in vaccinology have paved the way for more rational methods of vaccine development. These new technologies, such as reverse vaccinology, structural vaccinology, systems vaccinology and systems immunogenetics, are paving the way for the design and development of so-called -third generation\u2016 vaccines [192,193]. \n\nSystems vaccinology is an emerging new methodology; it refers to applying tools from systems biology to vaccine studies [194][195][196][197]. The tools of systems biology consist of a number of high-throughput technologies, including DNA microarrays, protein arrays, deep sequencing and mass spectrometry [198]. They allow system-wide unbiased molecular measurements, which can then be used to reconstruct the events during an immune response. For example, about a week after the administration of influenza vaccines, antibody producing plasma blasts increase in the blood and their gene expression pattern will appear in the transcriptomic profile measured from peripheral blood [199]. Published studies have used systems biology approaches to identify molecular networks that shape immunity in response to vaccination in humans [194,195,200]. Analyses of the immune response to the vaccine against yellow fever virus (YF-17D) have provided proof of the concept that molecular signatures in the blood of humans, induced within a few days after vaccination, can be used to predict the magnitude of the later immune responses to a vaccine and are beginning to yield insights about the nature of the innate and adaptive responses to vaccination [201,202]. Subsequently, systems biology approaches have been extended to identify predictive signatures of vaccines against influenza virus and are used to study immune responses to other The new field of systems vaccinology can address the mechanisms that control immune responses to vaccination and identify predictors of vaccine efficacy [197]. \n\nSystems immunogenetics provides another powerful and robust framework for vaccine discovery, development, and delivery. Mechanistic studies can reveal new vaccine targets or -rescue\u2016 previously discarded candidates by elucidating how genetic variation can influence innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccines.",

            "text": "In vaccine development, genomics studies have dual functions of identifying protective antigens and elucidating the underlying mechanisms of immune protection induced by vaccination. Several\u201a approaches have been used for the search of immunogenic proteins for viral and bacterial vaccines. In the case of viral vaccines, reverse genetics have been used for the identification of immunogenic proteins for IPNV [74], peptide scanning for NNV [75] and IPNV [76], phage display for infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) [77] and IHNV [78] while bioinformatics has been used to identify immunogenic proteins for SGIV [79]. The search of bacterial immunogenic proteins is mostly centered on identifying antigens that provide protective immunity across variant serotypes of the same bacterial species. Wang et al. [80] used the tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling-based quantitative proteomics to identify the most immunogenic outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of A. hydrophila. Another approach used for bacterial vaccines is the in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT), which has been widely used for the selection of antigens for different bacterial species such as Edwardsiella tarda [81], A. salmonicida [82] and Streptococcus iniae [83]. Taken together, these advances play an important role in the design of genetically engineered vaccines encoding immunogenic proteins in heterologous vectors used in the production of DNA, fusion protein and subunit recombinant vaccines. Apart from genetically engineered vaccines, genomic studies have also been used for the identification of avirulent strains for use as live attenuated vaccines as shown by Zhang et al. [84] who used Illumina sequencing for the characterization of attenuated strains of Streptococcus agalactiae with the potential to serve as a live vaccine. \n\nIn fish vaccinology, transcriptome studies are being used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying vaccine protection.",

            "text": "The best way to prevent diseases caused by pathogens is by the use of vaccines. The advent of genomics enables genome-wide searches of new vaccine candidates, called reverse vaccinology. The most common strategy to apply reverse vaccinology is by designing subunit recombinant vaccines, which usually generate an humoral immune response due to B-cell epitopes in proteins. A major problem for this strategy is the identification of protective immunogenic proteins from the surfome of the pathogen. Epitope mimicry may lead to auto-immune phenomena related to several human diseases. A sequence-based computational analysis has been carried out applying the BLASTP algorithm. Therefore, two huge databases have been created, one with the most complete and current linear B-cell epitopes, and the other one with the surface-protein sequences of the main human respiratory bacterial pathogens. We found that none of the 7353 linear B-cell epitopes analysed shares any sequence identity region with human proteins capable of generating antibodies, and that only 1% of the 2175 exposed proteins analysed contain a stretch of shared sequence with the human proteome. These findings suggest the existence of a mechanism to avoid autoimmunity. We also propose a strategy for corroborating or warning about the viability of a protein linear B-cell epitope as a putative vaccine candidate in a reverse vaccinology study; so, epitopes without any sequence identity with human proteins should be very good vaccine candidates, and the other way around.",

The use of recombinant DNA technology allows the targeting of immune responses focused against a few protective antigens. The conventional recombination methods for generating vaccines are time-consuming, laborious, and less efficient. To overcome these limitations, a new precise CRISPR/Cas9 with high efficacy, specificity, and low-cost properties has solved a lot of current problems of recombinant vaccines that intrigued the inspiration for novel recombinant vaccine development. CRISPR/Cas9 system was discovered as a bacterial adaptive immune system. In the domain of virology, CRISPR/Cas9 is used to engineer the virus genome to understand the fundamentals of viral pathogenesis, gene therapy, and virus\u2013host interactions. One step ahead CRISPR/Cass9 bypassed the vaccine to precisely engineer the B-cells to secrete the specific antibodies against deadly viral pathogens. There is a critical literature review gap especially in the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to generate recombinant vaccines against viral diseases and its prospective application to engineering the B-cells in immunocompromised people. This review heights the application of CRISPR/Cas9 compared to conventional approaches for the development of recombinant vaccine vectors, editing the genes of B-cells, and challenges that need to be overcome. The factors affecting CRISPR/Cas9-edited recombinant vaccines and prospects in the context of viral genome editing for the development of vaccines will be discussed.",

Here, we review the methodologies applied to vaccine candidate discovery for Plasmodium falciparum malaria from the pre\u2010 to post\u2010genomic era. Probing of genomic and cDNA libraries with antibodies of defined specificities or functional activity predominated the former, whereas reverse vaccinology encompassing high throughput in silico analyses of genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic parasite data sets is the mainstay of the latter. Antibody\u2010guided vaccine design spanned both eras but currently benefits from technological advances facilitating high\u2010throughput screening and downstream applications. We make the case that although we have exponentially increased our ability to identify numerous potential vaccine candidates in a relatively short space of time, a significant bottleneck remains in their validation and prioritization for evaluation in clinical trials. Longitudinal cohort studies provide supportive evidence but results are often conflicting between studies. Demonstration of antigen\u2010specific antibody function is valuable but the relative importance of one mechanism over another with regards to protection remains undetermined. Animal models offer useful insights but may not accurately reflect human disease. Challenge studies in humans are preferable but prohibitively expensive. In the absence of reliable correlates of protection, suitable animal models or a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying protective immunity in humans, vaccine candidate discovery per se may not be sufficient to provide the paradigm shift necessary to develop the next generation of highly effective subunit malaria vaccines.",

We proposed earlier that genomic variability and post-translational protein modification enhance the immune evasion of Mhp [5], which limits the general applicability of commercial vaccines. On the other hand, reverse vaccinology has been developed for a rapid and effective vaccine development pipeline in recent studies, and a variety of candidate vaccines against viruses, parasites, and bacteria have been reported. In the reverse vaccinology pipeline, pan-genome analysis can find ubiquitous antigens within different strains. The selected immunodominant antigens only account for 1% of all core proteins in this study. In another study, this proportion was also very low (2212 core proteins and 4 immunodominant antigens in Klebsiella pneumoniae), which indicates that the pipeline for candidate antigen selection is strict [27]. These antigens can be used for epitope selection and can also serve as candidate immunogens for genetically engineered vaccines. \n\nThe steps for epitope selection in this study mainly included selecting B-cell, MHC-II binding, and MHC-I binding epitopes. These processes were rapid, and, to improve the accuracy, more than one prediction or identification method was used. The final vaccine was a combination of conserved epitopes rather than subunit proteins, and the results of multiple sequence alignments of epitopes and their homologous sequences in different Mhp strains are shown in Supplementary File S1. Although some epitopes had amino acid mutations, the frequency of these mutations was relatively low. These properties may enable a multi-epitope vaccine to induce universal antibodies against the selected antigens and overcome the immune evasion of Mhp.",

The conventional vaccine development methods are time consuming as they require cultivation of pathogenic microorganisms in laboratory conditions and their dissection using microbiological, biochemical and immunological methods in order to identify the components important for immunogenecity. These methods are ineffective in circumstances where the cultivation of bacteria is difficult or impossible. The other limitations arise when the expression of protective antigens is less or absent in in vitro conditions compared to in vivo diseased conditions [2]. In comparison to conventional live attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines are more reliable as far as safety is concerned [3]. Vaccine candidate identification is an essential and important component in subunit vaccine development. The integration of genomics in vaccine research (vaccinogenomics) is expected to revolutionize novel vaccine candidate identification [4]. Computational approach, especially reverse vaccinology (RV) method assists the identification of vaccine candidates from genomes without culturing microorganisms and thus facilitates the subunit vaccine development. These methods are useful in reducing time, cost and number of wet lab experiments [2]. \n\nThe RV is a computational pipeline for identification of vaccine candidates against microorganisms from their genome sequences. Thus, all proteins of an organism can be screened computationally for their vaccine potential. Significant success of this principle for vaccine development had already been demonstrated in several pathogens, including Neisseria meningitides [5], Helicobacter pylori [6], Streptococcus pneumoniae [7], Porphyromonas gingivalis [8], Chlamydia pneumoniae [9] and Bacillus anthracis [10]. The relevance of this method was recognized when vaccines developed from capsular polysaccharides of N. meningitides B failed due to cross reactivity against human tissue [5]. Application of RV techniques for PVC identification and then in vivo testing led to the development of licensed broad specificity protein vaccine, 5CVMB, against N. meningitides.",

            "text": "This includes the development of a potential epitope (AMA-1) based vaccine candidate against Plasmodium vivax [19]. Recently, in 2019, a computationally predicted multi-epitope candidate vaccine was evaluated against Acinetobacter baumannii with potent IgG antibody-specific immune response in mice [20]. Similarly, the utility of computationally predicted B-cell epitopes was also confirmed in diagnostics against Trypsonoma vivax [21]. For instance, such approaches have been deployed against several human pathogenic viruses, including Ebola virus [22], Marburg virus [23], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [24], and Mokola Rabies virus [25]. Moreover, Ziwei et al. predicted T-cell and B-cell epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and tested them experimentally, which resulted in a highly immunogenic response in experimental mice [26]. This reflects the potential implications of reverse-vaccinology-based approaches in vaccine design against human pathogenic viruses. \n\nKeeping in view the importance of subtractive proteomics in vaccine target mining and reverse-vaccinology-based vaccine design, in the present study, we also aimed to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine for Y. pestis by screening the whole proteome. Using subtractive proteomics followed by a reverse vaccinology pipeline, potential virulent and highly antigenic proteins from the Y. pestis proteome to design B-cell, HTL, and T-cell epitopes were identified. These epitopes were used in the design of a vaccine construct, which was then modeled and docked with TLR-4 immune receptor and subjected to biophysical analysis. Overall, the results presented in this study are interesting and may be useful to accelerating the development of an effective vaccine to combat this deadly pathogen.",

Reverse vaccinology has the potential to extend the number of subunit candidates of a pathogen from none or a few that were identified by conventional vaccinology to a genome-wide scale, saving time and energy. If the pathogen of interest is successfully controlled by humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies, the genome-wide screening could be further confined to the potential surface-exposed or secretory antigens. Otherwise, the genome-wide antigenic capacity is open to surveys for T cell epitopes as cellular immune response inducers.",

            "text": "Recombinant vaccines are designed to induce highly characterized immune responses with only specific parts of a pathogen. With this characteristic, they might provide safe and efficient vaccines for viral pathogens where traditional approaches have failed. For example, successful subunit vaccines have already been developed for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus [119]. Two subunit vaccines for DENV and WNV have been tested in Phase I trials, however, these trials resulted in insufficient data for immunogenicity [85]. Although subunit vaccines for flaviviruses are far from becoming commercially available, numerous preclinical studies are being conducted with promising candidates. The use of bacterial flagellin is employed in various preclinical approaches for DENV, ZIKV and WNV, as the flagellin is able to trigger the toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) response [120][121][122]. This approach has shown success in vaccine development for influenza, as it links the humoral and innate immunity, which makes the vaccine resemble a natural infection [123,124]. Other approaches for DENV, ZIKV and WNV describe various ways of producing a recombinant E protein, which is the major antigen for generating nAbs [88]. Many of them report high immunogenicity and safety in preclinical studies but have yet to be tested in clinical trials. \n\nAnother recombinant approach for flavivirus vaccines could be the development of VLPs [64]. Since VLPs resemble infectious viral particles while also presenting highly recognizable antigens, VLPs often elicit stronger immune responses than subunit vaccines. VLPs bring various advantages to the table, such as low costs, easy development and high safety, although little is known about clinical use. Several preclinical studies on VLP vaccine candidates are currently being conducted for DENV and ZIKV, some of which have been tested in NHPs [125]. Presently, there is a plethora of different approaches to develop VLPs, as there are over 170 different expression systems available for use.",

            "text": "The vaccine is a biological agent that provides protective immunity against specific infectious diseases. Conventional vaccines can be produced from killed microorganisms, their toxins, or their surface proteins to induce specific immunity in a host. Vaccination enables the body to acquire protective immunity to eliminate the microorganisms related to the antigen that may be encountered in the future. The conventional approach involves typical antigen identification, beginning with the culture of pathogenic microorganisms in the laboratory, dissecting their component proteins, and then analyzing these proteins in vitro and in vivo, finally resulting in the characterization of target proteins that exhibit requisite protective immune responses. However, many pathogenic proteins are only transiently expressed in the infection process. Some pathogenic proteins are difficult to express in vitro and it is thus challenging to acquire sufficient quantities for vaccine production. To overcome these challenges, bioinformatics was first applied and used in vaccinology against Serogroup B meningococcus 54 by Masignani et al. 55 called reverse vaccinology. It uses the information of genomic sequences to find target antigens for new potential vaccines. A whole genome of pathogens can be screened using bioinformatics methods to search effective target antigens by a computational method 56 . The screened gene may feature potential antigenicity or code for critical proteins with immune cell epitopes, signal peptides, and extracellular localization 57 . A good vaccine target antigen such as outer membrane proteins can be selected and designed from these genes. Once the target antigen is selected, it can be expressed in vitro and examined in animal models treated with infection 58 . The use of bioinformatics to find vaccine target antigens is quick and efficient. Conventional approaches may need decades to decipher pathogenic antigens, immunity, and diseases. However, in silico methods can be implemented easily and quickly, allowing one to identify target antigens for analysis in only a few years 59 . Many programs make reverse vaccinology information more accessible. Vaxign (Vaccine Design) was created in 2008, a comprehensive program including vaccine target antigen prediction and analysis system according to the principle of reverse vaccinology. It was demonstrated to be efficient and accurate for predicting target antigen and completely public access use 60 . Another software, RANKPEP, is also used for predicting peptide binding.",

            "text": "Despite many decades of research, an effective vaccine for some pathogens, including those causing malaria, remains elusive [41]. The reverse vaccinology approach, in which the genome of an organism is examined to identify novel antigens, has brought about a new generation of vaccine candidates [42,43]. Advances in multi-strain genome sequencing have enabled not only the identification of novel surface antigens, but also the ability to discern polymorphic and conserved regions. However, vaccines designed using protein sequence alone are not likely to induce optimal antibody responses to pathogen antigens in their native state. The application of structural vaccinology may be the next step in rational vaccine design. Similar to structure-based drug design [44,45], the structural vaccinology strategy employs structural data from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and/or cryo-EM to inform the rational design of novel vaccine antigens. \n\nCurrently, the use of structure-based vaccine design in malaria or disordered antigens is sparse. One study of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from Plasmodium falciparum detailed the structure of the immunodominant NANP repeat region when complexed with functional antibodies elicited by RTS,S vaccinees [46,47]. In that study the same peptide epitope was found to adopt different conformations when bound to different antibodies. Such structural insights may provide a rationale for structure-based antigen design to improve the efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine. Early applications in other diseases, involving the grafting of multiple electrostatic surfaces from Neisseria meningitidis variants onto chimeric antigens have shown promise and were able to elicit a cross-protective immune response [24]. In the HIV field, a key epitope recognised by the broadly neutralising antibody 2F5 was stabilised using protein scaffolds [30,48,49]. Although antibodies with similar binding to 2F5 were elicited when the antigen was used to immunise guinea pigs, the project faltered at later stages when these antibodies were unable to neutralise HIV. Crystal structures have also been used to assist in the design of respiratory syncytial virus antigens stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation [26].",

The production of recombinant proteins is typically achieved by nucleotide sequencing of the genome of the infectious agent, followed by identification of the gene(s) encoding the protein antigen and then insertion of the candidate gene into mammalian, yeast, or bacterial cells for the expression of the target protein. The expressed proteins are further extracted and purified to produce a subunit vaccine. Considerable research has been devoted to evaluating the efficacy of recombinant subunit vaccines against multiple pathogens, such as IBDV [40], Eimeria species [41,42], chicken infectious anemia [43], and avian leukosis virus (ALV) [44]. \n\nEven though this technology enables high protein yields and allows the incorporation of multiple proteins, rich in defined epitopes, into a subunit vaccine, the lack of exogenous immune activating components, such as lipids, nucleic acid, etc., makes them moderately immunogenic [45]. This problem was partially overcome by incorporating adjuvants into these vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity. For example, a quadrivalent subunit vaccine containing recombinant proteins for four Eimeria species (E. tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervuline, and E. maxima) provided partial cross-protection against heterologous challenge with these species [45]. On the other hand, an enhanced protective immunity against avian coccidiosis [41,42], chicken anemia virus [42], and ALV [44] was attained when recombinant antigens were used in combination with different adjuvants. Nonetheless, the possible occurrence of improper protein folding and inclusion body formation during protein translation constitutes a barrier to the successful development of recombinant vaccines.

            "text": "Considering the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the increasing resistance of bacteria to them, employing new approaches for vaccines is emerging as the optimal strategy for treating and preventing bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics. To effectively vaccinate against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it is crucial to utilize safe, low-risk, and low-complication vaccines. Conventional lipopolysaccharide-based and conjugate protein vaccines have been developed against rapidly mutating strains of bacteria such as S. pneumoniae. However, such approaches are laborious, require complex processes, and may be impractical against the rapid evolution and emergence of multiple bacterial serotypes. An effective and novel approach entails employing the reverse vaccinology method to develop subunit vaccines with minimal side effects. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the field of vaccine design undergoing significant transformation with the adoption of reverse vaccinology [246]. This method involves vaccinating the patient against conserved and immunogenic epitopes and antigenic determinants of the bacteria. In particular, the strategy of in silico integration of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics may be used to identify conserved and immunogenic epitopes that could be incorporated into next-generation multi-epitope vaccines such as recombinant protein, DNA, or mRNA vaccines [247,248]. These vaccines are amenable to accelerated developmental timelines and can quickly progress to the clinical stage in order to curb the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Thus, next-generation vaccines offer a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness and safety of vaccine candidates, ultimately contributing to improved global health outcomes.",

The annual prepa ration of conventional vaccines (live attenuated, whole virion, and split and subunit vaccines) includes, in the first place, the phase of obtaining vac cine strains, which usually takes up to 6 months. Many technological techniques and innovations are oriented to the prompt preparation of antigen producers and the possibility to modify them in correspondence with the data on antigenic drifts of important seasonal or pandemic viruses. Thus, the vaccines now in use can be supplemented by the following list: DNA vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, vector based vaccines (their obtaining is connected with the use of one of the most attractive technologies for virus like particles), and a universal vaccine based on highly conservative antigens (M2, M1, and NP proteins). \n\nIn fact, the term recombinant vaccines can define any type of vaccine preparations obtained through genetic engineering. At the same time, considering the advance of these approaches to constructing influenza vaccines, it is more appropriate to specify recombinant vaccines by two types: recombinant influenza viruses used as vectors or deficient viruses for obtaining non pathogenic vaccine strains and constructs bearing individual viral genes for obtaining different types of vaccines. \n\nWe considered above the first approach and now we consider the second approach. \n\nIn practice, the process of constructing individual recombinant vaccines comprises the following actions: \n\n(1) Cloning and expression of individual viral genes in different vectors to obtain viral antigens in different expression systems as highly purified vaccine prepara tions. \n\n(2) Cloning and expression of individual viral anti gens to obtain virus like particles, \n\n(3) Cloning and expression of viral antigens in eukaryotic vectors to obtain DNA vaccines. \n\nTo achieve each of the above results, one is to make a well grounded selection. \n\nThe following antigen proteins are localized on a viral particle's surface: haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and the M2 protein.",

            "text": "The development of an effective polyvalent or universal vaccine is dependent on the identification and selection of common protective antigens and epitopes [39,49,50]. The availability of complete bacterial genomes, including different strains and serotypes, and several in silico tools [49] make it possible to select common protective antigens that can be utilized in the development of effective universal or polyvalent vaccines for finfish [51]. Reverse vaccinology is a predictive bioinformatics analysis that can identify potential protective antigens and epitopes [51]. Reverse vaccinology was first used against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B two decades ago after many unsuccessful trials using the conventional method of vaccine development [52,53]. Over 600 potential antigens were found in the sequenced genome of N. meningitidis serogroup B. It has been shown that predicted secreted or outer membrane proteins can serve as protective antigens [54][55][56][57][58]. Despite the success of the reverse vaccinology approach for vaccine development, this is yet to be fully exploited in the identification of novel antigens for fish vaccinology. Reverse vaccinology has been used to identify novel antigens against fish pathogens, including V. anguillarum [49] and Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida [59]. However, other major Gram-negative pathogens affecting the marine finfish aquaculture are yet to be fully explored. \n\nHere, we developed a reverse vaccinology approach to screen the bacterial proteomes of the most frequent marine Gram-negative bacterial pathogens affecting the salmonid finfish aquaculture, including P. salmonis, A. salmonicida, Y. ruckeri, V. anguillarum, and M. viscosa completed genomes. We identified common antigens and epitopes that can be utilized in the development of universal or polyvalent vaccines. We evaluated the vaccine potentials of these common epitopes by visualizing their interaction with Atlantic salmon and Lumpfish major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II).",

            "text": "cell immunogenic regions as predicted by several immunoinformatic tools. It has been proposed previously that the simulation dynamics can be consistent with a realistic immunization process in terms of primary and secondary immune responses [45]. Likewise, clearance of antigen, production of antibody, development and persistence of memory B cells as well as CD4+ T cells over several months were assumed in the simulation outcome. For primary activation and maintenance of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells (both Th1 and Th2 type) [86] are believed to be required [87,88], where cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-4 could be involved [89][90][91][92]. The simulation outcome suggests chance for expression of high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, which may potentiate CD8+ T cell expansion. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the vaccine would trigger clonal expansion of epitope-specific T cells since we combined potent epitopes from several amastigote-associated proteins of comparable affinity, and it was consistent with the simulation dynamics for repeated exposure of 12 doses, as indicated by Simpson\u02bcs index (D). Rather, high level of IL-2 production can be expected for diverse epitope-mediated immune response functional over long time in vaccine-mediated immunity.\n\nExperimental validation is utmost to prove this computational work. Next phases of the reverse vaccinology approach would ideally involve assessing the recombinant immunogenic protein expressed in the E. coli (strain K12) system as proposed here, in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active VL patients as well as healthy endemic people for cytokine production, and evaluation in challenge models. While a multi-epitope vaccine molecule generated by using a reverse vaccinology approach can induce specific responses in in vivo and in vitro assays, a single recombinant molecule can also reduce the cost of production [93,94]. The in silico designed vaccine reported here confers substantial immunogenic potential to be considered for in vitro experimental evaluation in the next phase of the study.",

Currently, many vaccines are under development which are based on the protein subunit technology. Such vaccines devoid of using infectious virus and instead use purified specific antigenic component, therefore eliminate isssues of virus attenuation/inactivation or virulence reversal to offer better safety profile compared to the other viral vaccines [194]. However, like other viral vaccines, protein subunit vaccines have limitations, major one is limited efficacy. In this technology, the isolated antigenic fragment of the pathogen likely denatured that conjugate with untargeted antibodies leading to the diminished efficacy [195]. Hovever, recombinant DNA technologies have successfully overcome such limitations as evidenced by the approval of first recombinant protein subunit vaccine against hepatitis B which has now controlled the disease to near elimination [196]. It has also open the way for regulatory relaxations for the vaccines developed by this technology [197]. Furhther advancements made in this vaccine technology make them more suitable for the immunocompromised individuals. For the production of recombinant proteins, E.coli [198][199][200] and yeasts are used [200,201].\n\nSeveral protein subunit vaccines are marketed against diseases including influenza, HPV, and hepatitis B [202]. To improve immunogenic action of such vaccines, diverse formulations of vaccines with potent adjuvants have been employed [144]. The subunit vaccine for hepatitis B is an example of a single antigen-containing subunit vaccines, whereas influenza vaccine is an example of a subunit vaccine that contains two antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase) [124,197,198,203]. Large scale production of purified antigenic protein is also challenging which can be improved by various expression systems including plant-based [204]. Envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were expressed in insect cells as well as in bacterial expression systems to develop subunit vaccines effective against CHIKV [205].

The stimulation of the innate immune system produces a complex cascade of cytokines that contribute to the immune recognition of cancer, possibly inducing apoptosis (22).\n\nVaccination is one of the most effective means to efficiently, rapidly and affordably improve public health; it is also the most feasible way to eradicate a variety of infectious diseases (28). Current vaccine research has mostly focused on peptide and subunit vaccines instead of whole organism vaccines. This is because subunit vaccines contain specific immunogenic components of the pathogens responsible for the infection rather than the whole pathogen. Traditional approaches for vaccine production have also been considered less efficient than computational approaches for a variety of reasons, including inaccuracy, safety, stability, high cost, hypersensitivity, and specificity.\n\nReverse vaccinology (RV), subtractive proteomics (SP), and genomics studies have emerged as powerful computational tools that have revolutionized the identification of drug targets and potential vaccine candidates (29). These methodologies are able to identify in silico the complete repertoire of immunogenic antigens and druggable targets that an organism is capable of expressing without the need of culturing the microorganism (30). In addition, it reduces the dependence on conventional animal testing based screening for getting a potentially suitable candidate, minimizing the time consuming and cost of the vaccine and drug development processes (31). Since the first application of reverse vaccinology that was used to development of a vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) (32), this tool has been used in the identification of numerous promising vaccine candidates against many bacterial pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae (33), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (34), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (30), Acinetobacter baumannii (35), and Neisseria meningitidis (36).\n\nIn this study, we have applied RV and SP based computational strategies and selected a new multi epitope-based vaccine candidate against Serratia marcescens, which can be used in further experiments to validate its efficacy, safety, and immunogenic profile.",

Subsequently, developments have been proposed to reverse vaccinology by suggesting the use of additional algorithms to find probability of being an adhesin, of topology (transmembrane domains) and to find similarity with host protein (Vivona et al., 2006). Recently, integrative approaches are proposed for reverse vaccinology by including prediction of multiple features of proteins such as signal peptides, membrane spanning regions, functional motifs and differences in amino acid composition unique to specific cellular compartments (Vivona et al., 2008). Implementing this approach, the following predictions were included: (1) First, computer analysis of the entire genome identifies the genes coding for predicted antigens and removes those antigens with homologies to human proteins. (2) Second, these identified antigens are screened for expression by the pathogen and for immunogenicity during infection. (3) Then the selected antigens are used to immunize experimental animals and examine the protective efficacy of immunization. (4) The presence and conservation of protective antigens in a collection of strains representative of the species (molecular epidemiology), is examined. (5) Finally, large scale production of target antigens are manufactured for clinical trials and candidate vaccines are examined for their safety and protective immunity in humans. (6) Authorized agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO) or the European Medicinal Agency (EMA) analyze and approve the scientific, clinical, and technical information. (7) Policymaking organizations, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and equivalent bodies from other nations, prepare the recommendation on how the vaccine should be used.

Immune enhancement exacerbating the immune responses may complicate vaccine development; accordingly, a balanced induction of NAbs, antibody effector functions, and T-cell immunity against multiple pathogens' antigens seems to be the aim to follow. Impressive advances with novel versatile platforms based on chimeric nanoparticles and versatile RNA chaperone functions have demonstrated that cross-protection against pre-pandemic viral diseases is possible using next-generation nanovaccines [177,178]. \n\nNanovaccine development potential and its rapid scaling-up is facilitated as only a protein's genetic code is needed and the mRNA can be produced synthetically, thus adding an important manufacturing advantage. Vaccinology technologies must move to global public health-related applications, mainly the \"One Health\" approach combined with modern omics (including glycomics and metabolomics), computational in silico strategies, protein modelling, genome editing engineering, and nanoparticles and nanocarriers' great potential is essential for combating hyper-variable-impacting pathogens [27,188,189]. A roadmap of global interdisciplinary collaborations, focused coordinated programmes, and critical investment is thus needed to accelerate vaccine design and timely modern worldwide vaccinology developments and solutions, because the future of vaccines could depend on using different nanoplatforms to create prototype vaccines ready to reduce or block transmission and prevent future threats.",

The real challenge in the development of subunit vaccines is to identify which antigens induce protective immunity [20].

These vaccines are produced in eggs or cell cultures and mainly induce antibodies against strain-specific HA. 6 Today, research is more focused on the development of subunit vaccines, as they are safer and easier to produce. With recombinant technology, the production of epitopes of interest, such as the conserved stalk domain of HA, can be done. \n\nIn addition to vaccine antigens, adjuvants are also sometimes added to vaccines to boost immunogenicity. Adjuvants are particularly important in the development of influenza vaccines for the elderly population who has decreased immune capacity and during pandemics, where a rapid antibody response is required. 7 In addition, adjuvants are also required in the development of novel peptide-based influenza vaccines, which are known to have low immunogenicity. There are currently six types of adjuvants that have been included in licensed influenza vaccines; alum, AS03, AF03, MF59, heat labile enterotoxin, and virosome, which is a nanoparticle (NP). \n\nRecently, the potential use of NPs as adjuvants in vaccines has been gaining interest. The inclusion of NPs in vaccine formulations has been reported to enhance antigen stability, [8][9][10] promote targeted antigen delivery, 11,12 and assist slow release of antigens 13,14 to eliminate the need for booster shots. 15,16 Different NPs have been evaluated for their ability to deliver antigens and increase immune responses against influenza antigens in vaccines. The current review focuses on the latest scientific advancement in the application of different NPs in influenza subunit vaccine development to enhance immunogenicity (Table 2).",

            "text": "The field of vaccinology came into being in 1796 with the discovery of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in which he used the whole live organism that causes smallpox, cowpox virus, to develop the vaccine. This was followed by the formulation of the polio vaccine using the killed or inactivated polio virus to develop the polio vaccine. Then there came the live attenuated vaccines in which the infectious agent is neither killed nor inactivated but rendered non-infective. Some examples include measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). Following this are the toxoid vaccines which are based on inactivated toxins of pathogenic microorganisms such as tetanus and diphtheria. In more recent times, subunit vaccines (an example is the HPV vaccine), in which components of the pathogen antigen to which immune response is stimulated are used in developing the vaccines. The components of the pathogen antigen can also be produced as recombinants and used for vaccine production. Subunit vaccines have excellent safety profiles but are generally less immunogenic compared with inactivated or attenuated vaccines and require much stronger adjuvants for enhanced immunogenicity. Other forms of vaccine platforms include conjugate vaccines in which poorly immunogenic surface molecules, such as polysaccharides of many bacteria, are synthesized and conjugated to strongly immunogenic proteins and are then used for vaccine development. Some examples include HiB, meningitis C, and pneumococcal vaccines; the next generation vaccines: vectored vaccines which involve putting vaccine antigens inside replicationdeficient microorganisms such as Adenoviruses and modified Vaccinia Ankara capable of triggering an immune response and the antigen is then vectored into the host cells; The genomebased approach (nucleic acid approach) which is based on the use of DNA or RNA to make desired antigens in the host thereby prompting an immune response; Reverse vaccinology in which vaccine candidates are selected on the basis of predicted immunogenicity emanating from sequence information obtained from the use of modern sequencing technology. This was successfully used in developing a vaccine against meningococcus B, which, till then, was difficult to be achieved using conventional vaccine technologies (Rappuolia et al., 2021); Structural",

            "text": "The second generation of vaccines was also the first to benefit from advances in genome sequencing and genetic engineering technology, which culminated with the advent of reverse vaccinology as we know it (105). Reverse vaccinology enables a genome-scale in silico screening of antigens according to their subcellular location, conservation, and hydrophobicity to predict those that are most likely to be vaccine candidates, which greatly simplifies the process of antigen selection (106). More recently, a third generation of nucleic acid vaccines has been developed. These vaccines overcome the need to isolate or synthetize the antigens needed for immunization, relying instead on having them expressed directly by the host cells (107). Fourth-generation vaccines, also referred to as next-generation vaccines, have an additional advantage as they can be developed as long as the sequence information of the pathogen is known (108). Examples include APC-targeting vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines delivered by nanoparticles, and artificial APC vaccines. APC-targeting vaccines can elicit particular types of responses needed for clearing specific pathogens by targeting different receptors of the APCs (109). Nucleic acid vaccines delivered by nanoparticles, mostly lipid nanoparticles, can stabilize nucleic acids, particularly mRNA, to enable the entry into cells and induce both humoral and cellular immune responses (108). Artificial APCs mimic APCs attached with epitope-loaded MHC molecules and costimulatory molecules, bypassing antigen processing and directly activating T cells to generate large numbers of immune effectors and achieve faster clearance of pathogens (110). \n\nDue to their nonreplicative nature, antigenic properties, and adjuvanticity, OMVs as immunogens do not really fit in any of the previously mentioned vaccine categories. As such, OMV-based vaccines constitute a category of their own. \n\nThe pluripotency of OMVs as adjuvants, antigens, and delivery platforms is being extensively investigated and has been proven by the development of several OMVbased pharmaceutical prototypes in the last 2 decades, which have been well summarized in other reviews (44,111,112).",

Based on the high-resolution complex structure of pre-F and antibodies, the F protein was modified to become stabilized in a pre-fusion state (DS-Cav1). Clinical phase I showed a more than 10-fold increase in the neutralizing activity of serum antibodies against prefusionspecific surface RSV F (Crank et al., 2019). Others designed and obtained a stable RBD-sc-dimer vaccine molecule, also based on structural interrogation. The N602 residue at the Cterminus of the RBD was designed in tandem with the Nterminus of another RBD, which improved the stability of the RBD dimer and the neutralizing antibody response (Dai et al., 2020). According to an official report, the phase III clinical data of the vaccine showed that the vaccine's protective efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity in people aged 18 years and over was 81.43% (NCT04646590). These results represent clinical evidence of the utility of structurebased vaccine design, heralding the dawn of a new era of precision vaccinology.\n\nThe recombinant subunit vaccine platform has technical advantages, such as safety and efficiency, and good stability, and a mature industry. However, safe and effective adjuvants are crucial to improving vaccine efficacy. New technologies of structural biology, reverse vaccinology, and novel adjuvants will facilitate the design of recombinant protein vaccines.",

Examples include development of strongly immunogenic vaccine candidates based on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) glycoprotein and the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [39,59]. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk and the dengue virus envelope protein were discovered using structure-guided design and high-throughput in vitro assays [38,66,76]. The culmination of the success of this strategy is the successful development of designer antigens, where structural information pertaining to existing bNAbs-antigen complexes was utilized to design linear and discontinuous HIV epitopes that were grafted onto computationally designed scaffolds [5,6]. \n\nDespite all these and many similar success stories of the application of rational vaccine design, and despite the fact that several broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 Abs have been found (e.g., IgG1 b12 targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 of the viral spike [95] and IgG 2G12, which recognizes a carbohydrate epitope on gp120 [92]), not a single promising HIV vaccine has been found after nearly 40 years of research utilizing various approaches, including structure-based reverse vaccinology [22,27,28,91].",

            "text": "This timely book reviews major advances in the field of bacterial vaccines made possible by the increasing number of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens determined in the last 15 years. Following an introductory chapter by Ruth Arnon of the Weizmann Institute describing various vaccine strategies used against microbial diseases, Chapter 2 by Rino Rappuoli and his colleagues from Novartis Vaccines in Siena, gives a comprehensive overview of a new approach known as reverse vaccinology. This approach, introduced ten years ago, was called reverse vaccinology because it does not search for vaccine candidates by the classical approach of fractionating bacterial extracts and establishing which antigens are able to induce a protective immune response, but by predicting potential vaccine immunogens using bioinformatic analyses of entire bacterial genomes. \n\nIn silico analysis of the genome provides a list of all the antigens that the pathogen is able to express and this allows investigators to choose in a reverse manner, starting from the genome rather than from the organism, which potentially surface-exposed proteins should be further investigated. The surface proteins are expressed using high-throughput technologies and then tested for immunoreactivity with patient sera and in immunogenicity and protection studies. Chapter 2 also describes various techniques used in reverse vaccinology such as in silico antigen prediction, protein identification by mass spectrometry, high-throughput antigen generation, the use of animal models for testing protection efficacy and the methods used for testing the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. Compared to earlier approaches which were always restricted to only a small number of purified antigens, reverse vaccinology identifies hundreds of proteins as potential vaccine candidates and tests them for immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Another advantage is that this strategy can be used with microorganisms that cannot be cultivated. \n\nOne chapter of the book is devoted to the first successful application of this new approach, namely the development of a vaccine against Meningococcus B (Men B), the pathogen that causes 50% of meningococcal meningitis worldwide. From a total of 2158 predicted open reading frames in the genome, 570 were selected as being potentially surface-exposed and 350 were successfully cloned in E. coli and purified in sufficient amounts for immunizing mice.",

            "text": "Vaccines developed during the pre-genomic era (also called vaccinology 1.0) were based on the use of dead, live, or attenuated organisms, or the use of one or more purified or semi-purified proteins obtained from total extracts of the organisms of interest [41]. To develop this type of vaccine, a critical step is necessary, the identification of the proteins of interest and the elimination of others that are not useful. In this case, an antigen is recognized as a protein capable to induce immune responses and provide protection, against subsequent challenges against the microorganism, or parasite in question [42,43]. \n\nThe empirical approach for the development of subunit vaccines includes several steps: a) the cultivation of the parasite, microorganism, or pest to be controlled, b) the analysis and purification of its components, c) the identification of the antigen that possesses the immunogenic characteristics required for the final product development, and d) the subsequent challenge by the infectious agent or parasite against which the vaccine has been made, in order to evaluate the immunogenic characteristics of this technology in an appropriate animal model (Figure 3) [44,45]. This methodology has inherent difficulties in the purification process and identification of the fractions with the optimal antigenic characteristics for vaccine development, as well as the availability of the macro or microorganism to be controlled by this biotechnological tool, since the production of the vaccine is severely limited when the target organism cannot be easily cultured [46]. There are other drawbacks associated with the biology of the target organism, since in some cases the most abundant proteins are not necessarily immunoprotective, or it may be the case that the antigens expressed during the in vivo infection or infestation, are not the same as those expressed during in vitro culture, the latter may not be the case of the R. microplus tick [47].",

            "text": "Thus, a considerable number of potential, putative, and possible vaccine candidate antigens could be missed by conventional experimental approaches. Reverse vaccinology [16][17][18][19] has the potential to analyse genomes for potential antigens, initially scanning \"open reading frames\" (ORFs), then selecting proteins because they are open to surveillance by the host immune system. This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines. \n\nReverse vaccinology was originally established and has been established by studying Neisseria meningitidis, which is responsible for meningococcal meningitis and sepsis. Vaccines are currently available for all serotypes, except that serogroup B. N. meningitidis ORFs were found initially [20,21]; 570 proteins were then identified, 350 expressed in vitro and 85 found to be surface exposed. Seven proteins elicited immunity over many strains. The culmination of this work was a \"universal\" vaccine for serogroup B based on five antigens [22]. This protovaccine, when used with Alum as adjuvant, induced murine bactericidal antibodies versus 78 % of 85 meningococcal strains drawn from the world population of N. meningitidis. Strain coverage increases to over 90 % when used with CpG or MF59 as adjuvant. \n\nAnother key illustration is Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic gramnegative bacterium found in the chronic adult inflammatory gum disease periodontitis. Initially, 370 ORFS were identified [23]; of these, 120 protein sequences were open to immune surveillance and 40 were positive for several sera. Two antigens were found to be protective in mice. \n\nYet another fascinating instance is provided by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a prime cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis [24,25].",

Recombinant pseudoadenoviral particles coding of influenza virus conservative antigens were used as a vector for gene delivery.

Animal experiments demonstrated that developed vaccines were very efficient against different influenza subtypes (80%-100% survivability). year. Currently the only licensed anti-tuberculosis vaccine is Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). This live attenuated vaccine has been in use for over 80 years and has displayed up to 80% efficacy against serious forms of the disease, e.g., meningitis, in children. However, efficacy in adults against pulmonary tuberculosis ranges from 0 to 80% in different trials. The protective immunity generated by BCG decreases with time, and almost disappears after 20-25 years, resulting in a vulnerability of the adult population to primary infection and reactivation of latent TB. Thus, development of an effective preventive vaccine and new \"post-infection\" vaccine are still important aims of vaccinology.\n\nIn this study we report the development of novel subunit protein-based vaccine against tuberculosis. Our vaccine consists of two recombinant mycobacterium proteins -Ag85A and fusion protein ESAT6-CFP10. These antigens are strongly recognized by T cells and they have demonstrated protective efficacy in animal models. However, because the protein component of the subunit vaccine is poorly immunogenic, the recombinant protein vaccine was adjuvanted with novel, three-component adjuvant system composed of the dextran, cationic DEAEdextran and oligodeoxynucleotide CpG. This adjuvant was chosen on the basis of its ability to induce strong protective immunity in animal",

            "text": "Cows are exposed to many pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms, and therefore have a broad antibody profile. Serum antibodies from aborted fetuses bound three proteins (BCY86_00790, BCY86_01995, and BCY86_06085) with specific antigenic responses and displayed minimal binding with two additional proteins (BCY86_03255 and BCY86_08690). The negative control fetal serum did not show binding with any recombinant proteins. This is likely due to the absence of microbe-specific antibodies in a healthy fetus. \n\nThe functional immunological testing of these protein candidates provides an initial validation of the reverse vaccinology in silico vaccine candidate prediction approach. The demonstration of an antibody response only addresses the humoral arm of the immune system and evidence of immunogenicity but does not validate actual protection. Robust antibody responses to intracellular pathogens often do not equate to protection. Further immunogenicity studies (ability to induce a specific antibody response in the host) need to be performed to determine the potential of these proteins to be viable as a recombinant vaccine. The results of this study indicate that the seven proteins displaying antigenic responses are promising targets for further studies in the development of a protective subunit recombinant vaccine for EBA. \n\nIn summary, protein BCY86_01995 displayed specific binding of antibodies derived from all three immune serum types (mature bovine, fetal bovine, and murine), providing evidence for designation as an EBA-specific antigen in the target bovine species. In silico analysis of this protein through the reverse vaccinology pipeline clearly ranked this protein as one of the top two vaccine candidates. Protein BCY86_01995 was ranked as the most promising candidate based on RNA-Seq results, which revealed an expression level that was an order of magnitude higher than the next candidate in the list. The other protein ranked in the top two, BCY86_08695, showed a positive response with EBAspecific binding in the mouse but did not exhibit any binding in the cow serum samples.",

            "text": "could be complicated by previous immunity against other flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV) [20][21][22]. Additionally, the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon could confound the development of any flavivirus vaccine [23].\n\nTraditionally vaccines have been developed by isolating one or more antigenic components from a given pathogen and checking whether these components are able of inducing a protective immune response. Although this approach has presented a series of successes throughout the history of vaccinology, the knowledge generated with the new genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies has contributed to the advancement of vaccinology and the production of more effective and safe vaccines [24][25][26]. One of the most promising approaches is the use of computational tools that allow the identification of genes in the genome of different pathogens encoding proteins with antigenic potential. This approach, called reverse vaccinology (Rvac), is a direct consequence of new 'omic' technologies and is currently recognized as a promising technique for the theoretical determination of proteins or peptides that have a potential for induction of an immune response. The use of Rvac could reduce time and cost related to development of new vaccines [27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. Therefore, Rvac can find important peptide sequences that can be used in the development of new vaccines [33].\n\nTo overcome the confounding effects of cross-reactivity between DENV and ZIKV, the potential influence of a previous antiflavivirus immunity on the outcome of ZIKV infection, the difficulty that this cross-reactivity implies in the development of vaccines and diagnostic tests of high sensitivity and specificity, we used the strategy of Rvac to find conserved, exclusive and potential immunogenic regions present in the structural and nonstructural proteins of ZIKV. These regions could be used as a guide to develop new vaccines and diagnostic technologies for the disease.",

            "text": "Currently rapid progress has been made in vaccine research and development against viral diseases. In particular, the speed and efficiency of response to emerging virus epidemics have been greatly improved, such as the application of computer-aided design of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the global pandemic of COVID-19 in early 2020 (Abbasi et al., 2022). In contrast, bacteria in the field of vaccine research and development are faced with more complicated challenges. The high variability of bacteria, rapidly evolving drug resistance, and complexity of interactions between bacteria and their hosts all challenge the development of effective vaccines against bacterial infectious diseases. To address these challenges, leveraging emerging tools such as artificial intelligence, computer-aided design, and advanced immunological evaluation techniques has become pivotal to accelerating the development of safe and effective vaccines. \n\nIn the process of vaccine design, scientists are challenged not only to identify the key antigens that can trigger lasting immune memory, but also to ensure that the vaccine can elicit broad protective immune responses, including humoral and cellular immune responses, to achieve effective protection in the long term. Recently, reverse vaccinology (RV) technology has been widely used in vaccine research and development. As a calculation method, RV is mainly applied to bacterial pathogens. Bexsero, a Neisseria meningitidis B vaccine designed by RV, has been registered and widely used in many countries (Heinson et al., 2015). In addition, a key component of vaccine development-antigen identification-is strongly supported by computational tools such as deep learning, reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. In-depth analysis of vaccine targets derived from pathogen protein-coding genomes has led to the successful development of a multi-epitope subunit vaccine with potentially potent protection. Although the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine need to be further verified (Rawal et al., 2021), this approach not only accelerates the vaccine design process and reduces the reliance on traditional trial methods, but also has important implications for addressing the threat of drug-resistant bacteria. \n\nResearch shows that a new type of machine learning model, compared with traditional methods, achieves higher precision and sensitivity in predicting aspects of mycobacterium tuberculosis (Khanna and Rana, 2019).",

            "text": "Despite many decades of research, an effective vaccine for some pathogens, including those causing malaria, remains elusive [41]. The reverse vaccinology approach, in which the genome of an organism is examined to identify novel antigens, has brought about a new generation of vaccine candidates [42,43]. Advances in multi-strain genome sequencing have enabled not only the identification of novel surface antigens, but also the ability to discern polymorphic and conserved regions. However, vaccines designed using protein sequence alone are not likely to induce optimal antibody responses to pathogen antigens in their native state. The application of structural vaccinology may be the next step in rational vaccine design. Similar to structure-based drug design [44,45], the structural vaccinology strategy employs structural data from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and/or cryo-EM to inform the rational design of novel vaccine antigens. \n\nCurrently, the use of structure-based vaccine design in malaria or disordered antigens is sparse. One study of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from Plasmodium falciparum detailed the structure of the immunodominant NANP repeat region when complexed with functional antibodies elicited by RTS,S vaccinees [46,47]. In that study the same peptide epitope was found to adopt different conformations when bound to different anti-",

A vaccine against the H5N1 influenza strain that is currently epidemic in Asian poultry could not be produced the classical way, by using embryonized chicken eggs without reducing the virulence of the virus by reverse genetics, due to high-mortality rates of the chicken embryos (Horimoto et al., 2006).\n\nRecombinant protein production systems may provide good alternatives for the development of vaccines that are more difficult to produce in vivo for manufacture of so-called subunit vaccines. A pathogen consists of many proteins, frequently with carbohydrate moieties, but these are not all equally important for generation of an adequate immunological response. Subunit vaccines contain the immunodominant components of a pathogen and in the case of viral vaccines these are often (glyco)proteins of the viral coat or envelope such as the hepatitis B surface antigen (Valenzuela et al., 1982) or the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) E2 glycoprotein (Bouma et al., 1999). Viral coat proteins sometimes form virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed in heterologous systems (Brown et al., 1991), which are often immunogenic and may induce both humoral and cellular responses. The subunit vaccine against hepatitis B produced in yeast is highly succesful. An extreme example of subunit vaccines are peptide-based vaccines which consist of small amino acid chains harboring the part of the antigenic protein that is recognized by antibodies. Typically, subunit vaccines do not contain the genetic material of the pathogen or only a small part thereof. Therefore, these vaccines cannot cause disease and do not introduce pathogens into nonendemic regions. An additional advantage of subunit vaccines is that they can be used in combination with specific marker tests, which make it possible to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals, the so-called DIVA vaccines (Capua et al., 2003;van Oirschot, 1999); an important issue in monitoring virus prevalence and virus-free export of animals and their products.\n\nImmunogenic subunits can be isolated chemically from the pathogen, such as the purified capsular polysaccharides present in the Strept",

            "text": "Dr. Haynes summarized the current portfolio of vaccine candidates and platforms and how these have evolved since the initiation of HIV vaccine studies over 30 years ago. A number of distinct concepts have been evaluated in clinical trials (39,40). The failure of multiple HIV vaccine platforms to elicit highly protective immunity or broadly neutralizing antibody responses in human adults underscored the need for novel approaches that would elicit fundamentally different immunity than earlier vaccine approaches. One approach to improving the quality of the HIV vaccine responses has been the presentation of native-like envelope trimer immunogens to the immune system, which has been attempted using gp140 subunit immunogens (41), fold-on trimers (42), native flexible linked (NFL) trimers ( 43), DNA vaccines encoding polyvalent gp120s (44), and mRNA vaccine approaches (45)(46)(47). John P. Moore (Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY) shared the status of SOSIP trimer immunogens that stand out as both engaging multiple bNAbs, eliciting vaccine strain-specific neutralization, and having overcome manufacturing challenges to yield clinical-trial-ready product (48)(49)(50)(51). Though the native-like immunogens are certainly an advance for HIV vaccine development, animal studies indicate that limited presentation of the correctly folded native-like immunogen to a mature adult immune system is unlikely to yield broad and protective HIV-specific immunity that will be required for a highly effective vaccine. \n\nThe B cell lineage design approach to HIV vaccine development emerged as a reverse vaccinology strategy guided by isolation of a collection of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from a subset of HIV-infected individuals who developed broad neutralizing responses. The preclinical HIV vaccine pipeline has further diversified to include candidate vaccines designed to specifically engage germ line immunoglobulin variable genes identified to develop into bNAb lineages in a subset of HIV-infected individuals.",

            "text": "Recent progress made in biotechnology and immunology has shifted the focus of vaccinology strategies to the development of recombinant subunit vaccines. Traditional subunit vaccines, which contain a part of the infectious microorganism rather than the whole pathogen, have already been used against several diseases like pertussis or influenza. However, these vaccines have encountered some disadvantages during commercialization, including low efficiency, biosafety issues, cost-effectiveness, and complexity of scale-up [14,15]. At this point, recombinant subunit vaccines allow for the development of vaccines against a wide range of viruses while eliminating the challenges associated with traditional subunit vaccines through the use of more controlled bioprocess in a shorter production time. This process involves the transfer of a gene encoding an antigen to the different heterologous hosts, like yeast, bacterial species, insects, and mammalian cells [16,17]. A typical example of recombinant subunit vaccine, which is approved for use in humans, was developed One of the substantial strategies in vaccine improvement is the use of novel alternative expression systems instead of traditional ones (bacteria, yeast, insect, and mammalian). With the recent developments in plant biotechnology and immunology, studies have focused on the use of different plant species as bioreactors for recombinant protein production. Plants offer an attractive alternative to the common expression systems since they possess several advantages, including cost-effectiveness, ease of scale-up, ability to perform post-translational modifications similar to mammalian cells, and great bio safety due to the lack of infectious pathogens. Besides, the expression of immunogenic components in edible plants allows the vaccine to be delivered orally, which makes the vaccination approach simple and safer. Although protein expression systems in plants may initially seem attractive, a few obstacles need to be solved before they can be extensively used. Some of the issues are associated with the use of modified plants and regulatory approvals because authorities have concerns about the spread of recombinant genes among other species and the possible hazardous effects of these plants on humans after consumption. Therefore, there should be wellestablished regulatory criteria for growth and use of transgenic plants in recombinant vaccine development [24][25][26].",

Advances in immunology, molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics, and proteomics have added new perspectives to the vaccinology field. The use of recombinant proteins allows the targeting of immune responses focused against few protective antigens. There are a variety of expression systems with different advantages, allowing the production of large quantities of proteins depending on the required characteristics. Live recombinant bacteria or viral vectors effectively stimulate the immune system as in natural infections and have intrinsic adjuvant properties. DNA vaccines, which consist of non-replicating plasmids, can induce strong long-term cellular immune responses. Prime-boost strategies combine different antigen delivery systems to broaden the immune response. In general, all of these strategies have shown advantages and disadvantages, and their use will depend on the knowledge of the mechanisms of infection of the target pathogen and of the immune response required for protection. In this review, we discuss some of the major breakthroughs that have been achieved using recombinant vaccine technologies, as well as new approaches and strategies for vaccine development, including potential shortcomings and risks.",

Moreover, plants can produce glycosylated recombinant proteins, which is not possible in an Escherichia coli-based culture system. As the glycosylation pattern affects the bioactivity of protein-based vaccines and therapeutics, recombinant proteins with a variable glycan pattern and improved efficacy can be generated by controlling glycosylation at different levels via glycoengineering of the host plant [19][20][21].

This reverse vaccinology approach also presents the advantage that previously unknown antigens (such as virulence factors) and even surface-located proteins can be identified, thus making it possible to study the function of some of these antigens, leading to a better understanding of the biology of the pathogen [149]. \n\nAlthough VLP vaccines containing surface glycoproteins can exhibit increased immunogenicity and efficacy, the highly mutational nature of these proteins, well exemplified by the HA and NA of influenza viruses, may require periodic updates of the vaccine antigens. Given the similar nature of TiLV to influenza viruses (segmented RNA virus), a possible solution could be the development of subunit vaccines based on conserved antigen epitopes. Although identification of such epitopes may be cumbersome, this approach could nevertheless be very effective against both newly emerging and previously circulating TiLV strains.",

            "text": "The beginning of the 21st century has already seen new vaccines licensed and become available due to the development of novel approaches. Novel technologies, such as the virus-like particles, have allowed the development of vaccines against HPV (Siddiqui & Perry, 2006;Keam & Harper, 2008). Reverse vaccinology, through mining of genome sequences for high-throughput antigen discovery, has successfully allowed the development of a novel multicomponent recombinant vaccine against meningococcus type B (Giuliani et al, 2006). The first therapeutic vaccine based on blood cell infusion has been licensed for prostate cancer (Plosker, 2011). Several tools have been developed and in some cases already tested in human trials, which will greatly support the discovery and rational design of novel vaccines against difficult targets such as HIV, malaria, TB, dengue, and S. aureus, where conventional technologies have failed. The hope is that, thanks to these technologies, more infectious diseases will be preventable by vaccinating children, adolescents, adults and elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised subjects. Novel vectors and adjuvants may also allow the development of therapeutic vaccines to treat different forms of cancer, chronic infections, and other inflammatory disorders. The development of innovative immunization regimes and novel delivery technologies provides unprecedented means to not just augment but to shape the immune responses. What the experiences of recent clinical trials have taught us is that while the quantity or magnitude of immune responses is important, the quality or flavor of these responses is equally important, and predicting immunogenicity does not necessarily translate into predicting protection. For many of the elusive targets in vaccine development, one of the most challenging gaps to fill is that of identifying biomarkers or correlates of protection. An immediate goal we should set is to exploit the trials undertaken to date, in the attempt to identify signatures of vaccine efficacy that can guide early selection of the most promising vaccine candidates for the future. Understanding what responses are desirable and necessary for protection and how they can be induced by a vaccine will unlock the door to rationally designing effective next-generation vaccines.",

            "text": "According to previous studies, inactivated CIAV vaccines can provide a moderate protective effect for breeding chickens [16,17]. However, since CIAV has a low titer in MDCC-MSB1 cells and chicken embryos, CIAV-inactivated vaccines have not been put into large-scale commercial use due to high production costs. \n\nWith the development of genetic-engineering technology, subunit vaccines and DNA vaccines have gained more and more attention from researchers. A subunit vaccine is a recombinant protective antigen prepared by transferring a viral protective gene into an expression vector. A subunit vaccine has strong immunogenicity, a single component, and relatively simple preparation. Subunit vaccines can induce the body to produce antibodies, but the activation of cellular immunity is limited. A DNA vaccine consists of a eukaryotic expression vector of recombinant DNA containing an antigen gene that is constructed by means of genetic recombination technology. It has the potential to simultaneously immunize multiple antigens and can stimulate the body to produce a humoral immune response and a cellular immune response at the same time [18]. \n\nAlthough certain progress has been made in the research and development of CIAV genetically engineered subunit vaccine and DNA vaccines [17,[19][20][21][22], there are still shortcomings in using these two vaccines alone, and there are few data on viral challenge protection tests of CIAV subunit vaccines and DNA vaccines. In this study, a subunit vaccine and a DNA vaccine of CIAV are prepared, and then chickens are inoculated with the CIAV DNA vaccine and subunit vaccine through a DNA prime/protein boost strategy, and the comprehensive effect is compared with chickens immunized with these two vaccines alone. In addition, the protective effect of combined immunization with the DNA vaccine and subunit vaccine on a CIAV challenge is studied through animal experiments.",

            "text": "However, both strategies have their shortcomings. Conventional vaccinations (attenuated or killed) are typically costly to produce, require adjuvants (inactivated vaccines) and multiple doses (live attenuated and inactivated vaccine) to induce adequate immunity, can interfere with maternal antibodies (live attenuated, inactivated), and offer little or no protection. Considering all of these challenges, continuous research is needed for the development of effective and safe vaccines [16]. Therefore, conventional vaccines have undergone considerable improvements, including mutantattenuated (live-attenuated) and subunit vaccines (a type of inactivated vaccine containing part of the bacteria or virus) over the years. Despite these advancements, only a few licensed commercial Salmonella vaccines are available (Table 1), which include live-attenuated vaccines, killed inactivated vaccines, and a few subunit vaccines [17]. Recently, the introduction of new biotechnological approaches in vaccine development generation has led to the development of potential next-generation vaccines, such as recombinant subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, bacterial ghost (BGs) vaccines, and reverse vaccinology [18]. DNA, bacterial ghost, and mRNA vaccines, when produced through recent developments in molecular biological techniques, induce robust immune responses against pathogens [19]. Another innovative approach to vaccine development is reverse vaccinology, which combines genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to identify new genes in pathogens that could elicit immune response [20]. However, the development of vaccines remains challenging due to the various Salmonella serovars and their unique pathogenic mechanisms. \n\nTherefore, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the developed vaccines for TS and NTS serovars in different animal hosts. Additionally, we used a systematic review approach to gather pertinent studies regarding the safety and efficacy of developed conventional and next-generation vaccines assessed in various animal hosts for this review, which is primarily intended for a broad scientific audience. This review will provide insights into the key issues that veterinary immunologists are currently facing.",

            "text": "This MenB vaccine is also the first vaccine approved for human use for which the starting point of development relied on genomic data and bioinformatics to select the initial pool of antigen candidates by reverse vaccinology (RV) [11]. \n\nThe great developments in the speed of DNA sequencing and the associated computational methods have enabled large-scale antigen mining by RV and it has already been used for several pathogens [12][13][14][15][16][17], mainly bacteria, but recently also for herpes simplex virus [18] to find surface expressed or secreted antigen candidates. Initially, candidates are often found to be suboptimal in terms of stability, safety, immunogenicity, or generating broad protection against all strains of the pathogen. Structural vaccinology (SV) is a rational approach that can be used to address these issues. Major aims in SV are the identification of protective Bcell epitopes on the antigens and optimizing the antigens in terms of stability, epitope presentation, ease of production and safety. SV is a symbiosis between experimental methods like X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and mass spectrometry, and computational methods like structural modeling, computational scaffold design and epitope prediction. Recent breakthrough examples in the fields of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [19], human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [20], MenB [21] and group B streptococcus (GBS) [22] indicate that SV has the potential to become another revolutionary step in vaccine development given that many of the important infectious diseases currently not preventable by vaccines are not amenable to traditional approaches. In this review we discuss the experimental and computational aspects of three key modules of a modern vaccine development pipeline: reverse vaccinology, epitope  characterization, and structure-based antigen optimization and design. Of the myriad of experimental methods, algorithms, and software developed for these approaches, we highlight the ones we consider of highest practical relevance for vaccine development. We summarize our view of the whole vaccine development process for current and near future vaccines in Figure 1.",

            "text": "Biomedical research in the 21 st century has been significantly influenced by the genomic revolution. While traditional methods of vaccine development, such as inactivated whole viruses are still used today (1), vaccine development is no exception. The shift towards omics-based approaches to vaccine development began to take hold with the meningococcal type B vaccine, which was developed using reverse vaccinology in the early 2010s (18,19). Under this approach, the genome of a pathogen is screened to identify potential vaccine targets (19), and pathogens of interest are then expressed in vitro and tested in animal models to determine their immunogenicity (19). In this way, the genomic revolution catalyzed a fundamental shift in the development of vaccines. Such technologies could revolutionize the role of vaccines given their potential to address one of the major limitations of vaccines today and facilitate the design of therapeutic, rather than just prophylactic, vaccines (20).\n\nNucleic-acid based approaches share an underlying principle: a vector that delivers the information needed to produce an antigen. When the host cells manufacture the antigen, it can then trigger an immune response. The fact that no part of the virus is introduced aside from the genetic code of the antigen means that these vaccines carry no risk of infection. Such approaches build on subunit vaccination strategies, where a component of a virus (e.g., an antigenic protein) is delivered by the vaccine. Platforms based on genomic sequencing began to be explored beginning in the 1980s as genetic research became increasingly feasible. Advances in genetic engineering allowed for gene sequences of specific viral antigens to be grown in vitro (21). Studies also demonstrated that model organisms could be induced to construct antigens that would trigger an immune response (22)(23)(24). These two developments sparked interest in whether it could be possible to identify any or all of the antigens encoded by a virus's genome and train the immune response to recognize them.\n\nThe delivery and presentation of antigens is fundamental to inducing immunity against a virus. Vaccines that deliver nucleic acids allow the introduction of foreign substances to the body to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses (25). Delivering a nucleic acid sequence to host cells allows the host to synthesize an antigen without exposure to a viral threat (25). Hostsynthesized",

            "text": "Reverse Vaccinology (RV) is a genome-based approach developed for the first time in early 1990's by Rappuoli (3) to identify meningococcal protein vaccine candidates in Group B meningococcus (MenB). In its original conception, since antigens inducing humoral antibody response are primarily located in extracellular or outer membrane district, all the open reading frames extracted from the genome sequence of MenB strain MC58 were screened to select proteins predicted to be surface exposed, secreted or lipoproteins. \n\nRV approach has revolutionized vaccine development by adopting computerized screening of protein sequences from the pathogen as the first step of the process, to select a subset of promising antigens, aka potential vaccine candidates (PVCs) (Figure 1A). \n\nRV offers two main advantages compared to traditional vaccine development approaches: (i) identification of candidate antigens without the need to grow the pathogen (ii) identification of any antigen independently by its purified quantity to be suitable for vaccine testing. \n\nProteins returned by RV methods are called throughout this review PVCs (Potential Vaccine Candidates). Other names given to the selected proteins are VCs (Vaccine Candidates), VTs (Vaccine Targets), PVCs (Protein Vaccine Candidates). PVCs identified by RV undergo in-vitro and in-vivo validation through experimental assays aimed at confirming their protective potential. Each pathogen has its specific experimental assays and it is hard to standardize a common set of experimental features; the most common experimental evidences are the protection outcomes in animal models against virulent bacterial challenge or results obtained from correlate to protection like the human bactericidal assay (4). In the context of this review we refer to any candidate protein that gave positive results in confirmatory preclinical experimental assays as BPAs (bacterial protective antigens). In the literature synonymous of BPAs are protective antigens (PAg), known antigens (KA), or known protective antigens (KPA). Lists of BPAs for different bacteria or viruses might be found in databases like Violin (Protegen) (5) or mining the literature. A comprehensive review of the main biological features characterizing BPAs deposited in Violin (Protegen) might be found in Ong et al. (6).",

            "text": "The \"protein-based\" or \"subunit\" vaccine comprises technologies to develop viral antigenic parts or fragments eliciting an effective immune response. 67 The PS vaccine development has used recombinant technology for synthesizing protein antigens. This approach has advantages over other platforms regarding the robust immune response, less severe adverse effects, less demanding in terms of production, storage, and transportation. Still, it demands optimization of adjuvant required for a more vigorous immune response. 67 Since recombinant PS vaccines are non-replicating, they are considered a safer approach. The principle lies in the uptake of recombinant viral antigen by the adjuvant-stimulated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the subsequent presentation to adaptive immune cells. This technology has been utilized and tested widely. The first example of the PS vaccine was anthrax protective antigen made in the 1960s and licensed in 1970; however, the PS vaccines for influenza remain famous. 67 Currently, the COVID-19 PS vaccines account for 33% of all vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Out of 28 PS vaccine candidates against COVID-19, six have already entered Phase 3 clinical trials. 68 These PS COVID-19 vaccine candidates are using different antigenic parts, mainly different versions of fulllength structural spike protein or fragment of S protein (S1 domain) that mediates viral binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of host cells or the receptorbinding domain (RBD). The S protein contains three domains: N-terminal outer domain with subunit S1 and subunit S2, Cterminal cytoplasmic domain, and a third transmembrane domain. The S protein has a trimeric structure with three S1 subunits (for viral attachment to host cells) placed on the top of the stem of three S2 subunits (for virus-cell membrane fusion). Receptor-binding motif (RBM) of RBD (residues 331-524) in the S1 subunit is precisely required for initial docking to ACE2.

            "text": "Besides neutralization, antigen-bound IgG can also trigger the initiation of the classical complement pathway, as well as other protective responses, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) 1 . These effector functions are finetuned by the structure of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, especially by the Fc subclass and glycosylation, which synergistically modulate the IgG affinity for complement and immune cell receptors 2 . \n\nDuring antimicrobial responses, polyclonal IgG targets several antigens on a given pathogen, and various epitopes within each antigen, resulting in a broader range of protective responses compared to monoclonal IgG. However, characterizing the properties of polyclonal antibodies at a systems-wide level, including their antigenic repertoires, binding epitopes, subclass distributions, glycosylation patterns, and effector functions, remains a significant analytical challenge 3 . In turn, a poor understanding of the structural and functional IgG features that contribute to host protection prevents the identification of useful correlates of immunity to major human pathogens and the development of antimicrobial vaccines 4,5 . \n\nRecently, efforts in reverse vaccinology have led to the development of systems antigenomic approaches that exploit the availability of annotated genome data, novel surface display technologies, and proteomics workflows, to characterize microbial antigens recognized by antibodies and T-cells. Examples include screening genome sequences of Group B Streptococcus, cloning surface-exposed antigens, and conducting immunization challenges in animal models; building protein arrays paired with flow cytometry binding assays to study antibodies against predicted surface GAS proteins; and using reverse vaccinology and human infection challenge models to explore the antigenic breadth of antibodies against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] . Systems antigenomics has been successful in defining pathogen-specific antibody antigenomes, (i.e., the spectrum of molecules expressed by a given pathogen that are recognized by host antibodies), a central bottleneck of most vaccine development pipelines 13,14 .",

Novel next generation vaccination involving a rational design of B-and T-cell epitope-based vaccine have made substantial progress in the clinical trials. The recombinant epitope-based malaria vaccine that successfully reached phase-III trials might become the first commercial vaccine for parasitic disease [27]. \n\nImmunoinformatic approaches have been used for prediction of an antigenic epitope for vaccine development and high-affinity antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic applications [28,29]. Some examples of computational immunoinformatic tools that has the potential to help experimental researchers to validate the in silico designed epitope-based vaccine includes but not limited to SARS-CoV-2 [30], Zika virus [31], and Nipah virus [32]. In silico identified protein regions with high probability of being effective epitopes might help in designing effective experimental assays with improved precision [33]. The present work involves the application of extensive computational immunoinformatic tools to identify potential B and T-cell epitopes to enable us to design a multi-epitope vaccine construct containing predicted antigenic fragments of rotavirus proteins. A tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell adhesion motif was added at the N-terminal end of the final vaccine construct to improve the immunogenicity. Allergenicity, antigenicity, epitope conservancy, structural modelling, docking and molecular dynamics simulation of vaccine constructs were carried out to ensure vaccine property of multi-epitope protein. Codon optimized multi-epitope vaccine antigens was expressed, and affinity purified in E. coli. The present observations of computational bioinformatics are expected to help researchers to select epitopes for further experimental validations and develop recombinant subunit vaccine against rotavirus.",

            "text": "Recently, several new platform technologies including recombinant VLPs have been developed in order to facilitate the scale-up of vaccine production including overcoming the drawbacks of the egg-based vaccine production method. The first recombinant influenza vaccine FluBlok based on HA antigen has received FDA approval [22]. The surface envelope glycoproteins such as influenza HA and NA generally are viewed as the primary targets for vaccine development. HA currently represents the major target for vaccine development including approved and experimental vaccines [22]. Recombinant HA-based vaccines have been shown to be efficacious against influenza including H7N9 [17, [23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Experimental NA-based vaccines have been reported [32,33]. The induction of immune responses against the surface envelope proteins has advantages, because virus-neutralizing antibody response to the viral envelope proteins can prevent early steps of viral infection. Human monoclonal antibodies targeting the HA glycoprotein can neutralize H7N9 influenza virus [34]. Importantly, the neutralizing antibodies protected against A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus challenge [35]. \n\nThe novel recombinant VLP vaccine platforms included VLPs prepared in mammalian, insect, and plant expression systems. Recombinant VLPs are morphologically and biochemically similar to the wild type influenza virus (Figure 2); however, they lack viral genetic material and are unable to replicate and cause infection. Table 2 shows examples of various VLPs prepared from H7N9 virus antigens. Cell culture-based production of VLPs can potentially overcome limitations of classic influenza vaccines [36]. As VLPs closely resemble viruses, they contain immunological epitopes in the natural conformation, are highly immunogenic, but they are non-infectious because they are prepared in the absence of viral genomic RNA segments. Each VLP represents a repetitive and highly organized molecular array of antigens displayed on the VLP surface. VLPs have been shown to be better immunogens than subunit vaccines because of their self-adjuvant properties [51].",

            "text": "In the early 1970s, advancements in molecular biology led to the development of recombinant DNA technology [9], and over the next 50 years, recombinant expression systems such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) or baculovirusinsect cells were stablished for foreign protein production, leading to the third phase of vaccine development and the emergence of subunit vaccines [8]. The first subunit vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) was approved in 1986 and was based on the viral surface protein that self-assembled into VLPs using S. cerevisiae as expression system [10]. Vaccine design focused on the use of specific antigens from infectious agents, including those that were unable to culture or were highly pathogenic, and recombinant vaccines such as human papillomavirus (HPV) were also developed. Over the last years, advances in genetic engineering have enabled the development of new platforms for protein expression, such as mammalian cells, plants or insect larvae, and also the emergence of new technologies applied to vaccine development, such as nanotechnology. \n\nNowadays, there are vaccines available to protect against more than 20 human diseases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that vaccines save between 4 million and 5 million lives every year [11]. Although the market value of veterinary vaccines is modest when compared to human counterparts, veterinary vaccination has also seen many significant advances in technologies over the last years. What is more, many new vaccine technologies may find their first commercial application in veterinary market, and this is reason why veterinary vaccines are more varied. In addition to traditional vaccines based on whole-pathogens and subunit vaccines, new vaccines technologies, such as live genetically modified pathogens, vectored vaccines (that use viruses as delivery systems for foreign antigens) and DNA vaccines, are already approved for their commercialization [12]. \n\nThe One Health approach has emerged in the recent decades as a new perspective within vaccination strategies. It is a transdisciplinary approach that recognizes the importance of the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment.",

            "text": "Sommerset et al. described commercially available fish vaccines and how they perceived that the field would evolve over time [12]. Additional reviews have focused on current vaccine applications for large-scale fish farming operations, and future trends for inactivated, live-attenuated, and DNA vaccines [13]. Given the development of new technology and a lack of research reviews on advancements in fish vaccine technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of where the field is currently. Up to now, over 26 licensed fish vaccines are commercially available worldwide for use in a variety of fish species (Table 1). Most of the vaccines have been approved for use by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for a variety of aquaculture species, and the majority of these vaccines utilize conventional production methods that start by culturing target pathogens [14,15]. This array of vaccines has successfully protected fish against a variety of serious fish diseases. \n\nA strong understanding in fish vaccinology is generally based on two sciences: microbiology and immunology. With the advancement of molecular biology and the improved knowledge of protective antigens, there are rapid developments for new generations of vaccines for use in animals and humans [16][17][18][19]. Modern vaccine technology has targeted specific pathogen components, and vaccines developed using such approaches may include subunit or recombinant DNA vaccines that contain novel antigens produced using various expression systems [19,20]. Other technologies, such as RNA particle vaccines, have been developed globally and appear to induce greater levels of immunity than traditional vaccine technology [18]. Overall, such advances are promising; however, actual implementation had been somewhat limited for aquaculture due in part to the challenges of the aqueous environment and practical application of mass vaccination due to the nature of commercial fish farming [21]. In this review, we describe the use of conventional aquaculture vaccines and provide an overview of molecular approaches to vaccine development that are the most promising for new vaccines for use in aquaculture.",

            "text": "Vaccination first began in the 18th Century when Edward Jenner protected humans from smallpox by administering material from humans infected with cowpox. In the 19th Century, Pasteur, Koch, Ramon and M\u00e9rieux pioneered the development of live-attenuated and killed vaccines, and inactivated toxins, to protect against rabies, cholera, plague and typhoid. Additional major vaccine developments in the 20th Century provided protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, several types of meningococcus and pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae B, hepatitis and influenza. Collectively, these vaccines have eliminated most of the life-threatening childhood diseases that previously caused millions of deaths and severe morbidity, thus rendering vaccination one of the most effective medical interventions in history [1,2]. In the 21st Century, vaccination continues to play a highly significant and expanding role in the control and elimination of disease. Nevertheless, many important disease-causing infections are not yet preventable by vaccination, including, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), groups A and B streptococcus (GAS, GBS), malaria, tuberculosis and ebola. Moreover, certain vulnerable population groups generally tend to be poorly served by vaccination. Therefore, further research and development of novel vaccines is required to address a plethora of currently unmet, globally-significant medical needs [3]. \n\nOne of the most important advances in vaccine research over the last 10-15 years was the advent of whole-genome sequencing technology. Genomics drove the development of the \"reverse vaccinology\" approach, which overcame challenges that had not been resolved via conventional vaccinology [4]. Indeed, it was the whole-genome sequencing of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B that enabled the development of reverse vaccinology for the identification of recombinant antigens for a protein-based vaccine against serogroup B meningococcus [5,6]. Since then, it has become routine to obtain the amino acid sequence of all possible proteins that a pathogen might encode in its genome, which greatly potentiates the early stages of vaccine discovery.",

            "text": "SCID mice have become the preferred host for propagation of P. abortibovis, providing a consistent bacterial load for experimental analysis (Blanchard et al. 2010). \n\nA live bacterial vaccine consisting of P. abortibovis-infected SCID mouse spleen cells is undergoing field trials with favorable results (J. L. Stott, unpublished data). However, the vaccine can only be administered to nonpregnant cows as the bacteria in the vaccine are live and virulent. A recombinant vaccine would provide the added benefit of being safe for administration to both open and pregnant cattle (Ellis 1999). Since recombinant vaccine development relies on a thorough understanding of the pathogen's genomic makeup, sequencing and assembly of the P. abortibovis genome was the first step in the development of a recombinant vaccine for EBA. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has increased access to large quantities of sequence data, thereby enabling the successful assembly of many bacterial genomes. Since the advent of NGS, a new field known as \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV), defined as an in silico approach to discover potential vaccine candidates starting with the genome sequence of a bacterial strain, has emerged (Rappuoli 2001). RV predicts putative antigens based on genomic sequence data and circumvents the limitations of traditional vaccine development for pathogens that are difficult to cultivate. The identification of vaccine candidates through an in silico approach can substantially reduce the immunologic bench experiments required to identify potential vaccine candidates. \n\nThe objectives of this study were to assemble and annotate the complete genome of P. abortibovis, use a RV approach to identify vaccine candidates, and perform immunologic western blots to experimentally evaluate the antigenicity of these candidate proteins.",

            "text": "Vaccination is now in its third century of practice. Beginning in 1796, the year in which vaccinology was born thanks to Edward Jenner, different approaches have implemented vaccine features in terms of effectiveness and safety [18]. \n\nUntil 1980, an empirical approach was used and microorganisms or their toxins had to be attenuated or killed and injected into the vaccine in order to elicit an immune response in the recipient. This method enabled the development of vaccines that, while generally highly immunogenic, had several side effects due to their high reactogenicity. Rabies vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), the Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccines, the Mumps, Rubella, and Measles vaccines, live attenuated and killed Polio vaccines, and polysaccharide vaccines against Meningococcus A, C, W, Y, and Haemophilus influenzae type B were all obtained by following an empirical approach [18]. \n\nIn the 1980s, important technological advances led to the production of conjugated vaccines and vaccines obtained using recombinant DNA technology. \n\nGlycoconjugate vaccines addressed the problem of low immunogenicity in highly purified vaccines by conjugating polysaccharides to proteins, leading to the production of novel conjugated vaccines against Pneumococcus, Haemophilus Influenzae type B, and Meningococcus A, C, W, and Y which were able to elicit a better immunological response in both children and in the elderly [18]. \n\nRecombinant DNA technology provided the ability to produce pathogen components in non-pathogenic vectors without the need for the pathogen itself, improving the safety and purity of vaccines and enabling the development of vaccines against Hepatitis B and Human Papilloma Virus, among others [18]. \n\nIn recent years, the availability of wide genomic screening has given rise to the possibility of analysing entire bacterial and viral genomes to discover novel vaccine targets. This new approach, known as \"reverse vaccinology\", has led to the development of vaccines otherwise impossible to produce, such as the Meningococcus B vaccine. \n\nMoreover, other innovative and interesting approaches include synthetic biology and structural biology.",

The method has proved to be very useful in evaluating basic B cell biology concepts in health and autoimmunity. Furthermore, valuable mAbs, have been isolated from vaccinated [46], naturally immunized donors [45] and patients with autoimmune disease [76]. In general, mAbs recovered by single B cell antibody technologies may be useful reagents for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic studies and clinical development. Major applications include the prevention of infectious diseases by passive immunization [77] and therapies for disorders currently medicated with serum IgG preparations [78]. A deeper understanding of neutralizing mAbs isolated from immune donors will also be helpful for rationale structure-based vaccine designs. Promising efforts in this reverse vaccinology approach are currently being made in HIV research, and should be applicable in other infectious diseases. In addition, future advancements on microfluidic platforms, including PCR cycling combined with next generation sequencing methods are likely to exceed the current systems and allow for high-throughput Ig gene sequence analyses of individual antibody repertoires. By increasing the availability of such repertoires, single B cell antibody technologies are likely to lead in the development of novel mAb therapeutics.",

            "text": "Vaccinology is an evolving science. The first attempts of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur to develop attenuated smallpox and rabies vaccines were soon followed by the discovery that immunization with toxoids or inactivated microorganisms protected against diphtheria, tetanus or whooping cough. Recently, the development of cell culture and recombinant DNA technologies has allowed the design of vaccines against a variety of bacteria and viruses [56]. The 21st century has projected novel technologies such as reverse vaccinology, which has resulted in vaccines against type B meningitis, or the recent advent of adenoviral vectors or mRNA vaccines [57]. \n\nIn this study, we propose a complementary approach through the use of attenuated vaccines as bacterial factories to produce the immunogenic constituents of other proof-of-concept vaccines. This approach is limited to live attenuated vaccines such as the typhoid vaccine, the TB vaccine BCG, or BCG-replacement strategies such as MTBVAC. The development of live vaccine factories opens interesting perspectives in terms of multivalent immunization, persistent presentation of the antigen to the immune system, or its preparation as lyophilized formulations. In addition to health benefits, the combination of multiple immunizations in a single vaccine allows lower costs in terms of production, distribution and personnel required for administration. We should also remember that live TB vaccines confer a plethora of beneficial, nonspecific effects [58] such as protecting against unrelated pathogens [18,22] through priming trained immunity [59] or enhancing the immunity of unrelated vaccines [31]. Taken together, these heterologous effects of live TB vaccines together with the potential to construct recombinant derivatives open exciting perspectives for nextgeneration vaccine strategies.",

            "text": "Transition of successful experimental vaccines to industrial production and manufacturing may become a bottle neck in vaccinology since veterinary vaccines need to fulfi ll several important requisites, among them environmental and safety issues, manufacturing costs and marketability prospects. Considering that most novel vaccine technologies (other than killed or attenuated vaccines) need to adapt the current production processes, many vaccines will never develop further enough to reach market. Nonetheless, animal vaccine research is a very attractive research fi eld with many advantages and complexity over human vaccine fi eld. Firstly, due the larger number of target animal species or segments (ruminant livestock, poultry, porcine, equine, companion animals, aquaculture, and other animal vaccines), secondly, the lack of deep knowledge in the immune mechanisms and lack of reagents adds more difficulties if immune response characterization is needed. The possibility to test the effi cacy of the vaccine prototypes in the target species and study the immune response evoked is one important difference that can speed the process of vaccine development over that of human vaccines. Another important advantage is the possibility of testing more innovative approaches that can be further tested for human vaccine development. \n\nThe following chapters illustrate a number of different techniques to provide antigen delivery in order to develop vaccines against viral diseases. Though the number of techniques is not exhaustive, the ones showed can be considered most currently used by laboratory researchers in the fi eld of animal health. The reader will fi nd useful examples for application to a particular viral disease since most of the techniques can be virtually applied to any virus pathogen. Among them, representative protocols for each of the broad categories for vaccine technologies discussed above. More discursive chapters are also included related to different techniques and protocols for analyses of the immune responses, the use of adjuvants as an essential part of vaccines based on nonlive organisms, and experiences on the use of DNA vaccination in large animals.",

            "text": "A key aspect of non-viral vaccine development involves the selection of antigens that can effectively elicit a protective immune response. Whereas traditional vaccines are generally developed through attenuation or inactivation of pathogens and through the incorporation of few selected antigens as vaccine components, new technologies have recently been applied toward antigen discovery and design. For example, \"reverse vaccinology\" refers to the ability to screen the complete antigen sets based on whole-genome sequencing of pathogens for the ability to induce protective antibody responses. Combinations of reverse vaccinology and traditional vaccine approaches allow for an efficient development of immunogenic vaccine candidates (74,75). \n\nBioinformatic tools have contributed greatly to vaccine design and evaluation in recent years. Computational approaches are continually improving in their ability to predict T and B-cell epitopes from the complete antigen pools and to rationally design antigens with potential long-lasting protective immunity. Such algorithms calculate antigen-antibody interaction energies and structures (76) that increasingly bridge modeling based on existing templates and free-modeling based on heterologous structures and database consensus design (77). Deep sequencing combined with computational analysis allows for thoroughly characterizing the B cell repertoire in survivors of disease to identify the protective immunity (78). \n\nA computationally designed antigen found to be protective in animal models was first reported for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F antigen in 2013 (79). Many challenging vaccine targets have since been developed rationally for HIV (80)(81)(82), hepatitis C (83,84), herpes (85), Zika (86,87), RSV (82), HPV (88), as well as for bacteria (82,89), fungi (90), and cancers (91). Rational vaccine design has also been utilized to improve VLP and NP vaccines by selecting a repetitive and predictive protein backbone structure for enhanced antigen presentation (92). Finally, rational antigen design is being explored for activation of dendritic cells (93) such as targeting C-type lectin receptors to activate antigen presentation in the context of the pathogens (e.g., Ebola and HIV) (94).",

            "text": "Although no multi-epitope vaccines have proceeded to clinical trials on animals or humans, they are on the event horizon. Multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) attempt to achieve the broadest response across ages and regional differences in pathogen strains by incorporating many times more antigens than are used in subunit vaccines by splicing together only the smaller epitope peptide chain sequences of the antigens. An effective multi-epitope vaccine would elicit a strong immune response without inducing the onset of autoimmune disease. In addition to provoking a broad immune response and longlasting immunity, they could potentially be customized for specific pathogens. However, the development of these vaccines is fraught with scientific, technical, logistical, and economic challenges. \n\nMulti-epitope vaccine construction utilizes reverse vaccinology, by starting with the pathogen's genome and using an in silico process to identify and predict multiple epitopes from antigenic proteins that can account for varied MHC profile compatibility, crossprotection, and precision medicine [29,36]. Multiple computational software and database bioinformatic and immunoinformatic tools are being used to more quickly and efficiently predict, design, and optimize vaccine candidates without the need for physical experiments until later stages. \n\nSelected epitopes are then assessed for their immunogenicity through the use of bioinformatic and immunoinformatic tools. The ability of the epitopes to elicit a strong immune response must then be validated experimentally, but since the use of reverse vaccinology attempts to improve upon the conventional approach to vaccine development by bypassing the cultivation stage of the pathogen to identify these antigens, this approach makes vaccine development faster, more effective, safer, and less costly [4,[29][30][31]. \n\nAn ideal multi-epitope vaccine candidate would possess both the ability to trigger a humoral and cell-mediated immune response, termed immunogenicity, as well as the ability to interact with the products of the immune response often in the form of antibodies or cell surface receptors, termed antigenicity [4,[29][30][31]37].",

            "text": "Vaccine research has moved from the application of whole organism approach (inactivated or live attenuated) to synthetic antigenic peptide-based or gene-based vaccine approaches for man and animals against a number of infectious diseases. \n\nVaccine discovery, though initially made by chance due to keen observation or hit and trial method, later became a deliberate attempt to combat infectious diseases. In initial times the whole organisms were applied in scarified wounds to give the host an opportunity to mount an immune response against an infectious agent. But later more specific and safer killed or attenuated live organism-based vaccines became important in vaccine research even though the vehicles added to make the vaccines more immunogenic were causing serious health problems in the individuals given the vaccines. Availability of desired vaccines against the lethal, wasting and debilitating diseases has backed immensely the attainment of successful public health programmes. As of now, scientific challenges still exist to develop safer, effective and reliable vaccines that boost protection against the pathogens of major significance. With the recent advancement in the field of immunology and vaccinology, modern biotechnological innovative approaches are becoming available to counter such diseases. \n\nTo ameliorate these problems, recombinant DNA technology-based vaccine research gained strength and advanced the idea of gene delivery as vaccines using shotgun method, replication-defective live virus vector vaccine, single-copy virus vaccine and split, peptide and edible vaccines have been researched. Thus, vaccinology has traversed through three successive phases/eras. The first one was with initial stages using scabs or infective material of related diseases in animals to prevent reinfection. The second era started with the advent of cell culture or chicken embryobased techniques and introduction of inactivated and attenuated viruses as vaccine, whereas the inclusion of rDNA technology in vaccine production made them to advance to the third era. The innovative technologies have transformed the concept of vaccine development and will go a long way in the generation of safer and more effective vaccines. Scientific advancements and their application will certainly provide better-quality health-based products. Based on cost-effectiveness, vaccination still remains a high priority for the prevention and control of animal diseases. These advancements in vaccine development will meaningfully lessen the prevalence of diseases in man and animals.",

            "text": "The evolution of vaccines can be traced back to the observation in the 18th century that a biological preparation of weakened or killed forms of the microbe can confer a protective immunity against a specific disease [17]. Over time, vaccine technology has yielded a wide range of new vaccines. Currently, vaccines can be classified, according to the nature of the antigen, into three groups: (a) first-generation (conventional) vaccines, which include live attenuated and inactivated or killed vaccines; (b) second-generation vaccines, also called subunit vaccines, which are composed of mostly protein parts such as protein antigens or recombinant proteins, and (c) third-generation vaccines which include recombinant vector and nucleic acid (DNA and mRNA) vaccines. Supplementary Table S1 provides a list of current commercial poultry vaccines, including their trade names, manufacturers, and routes of administration, in accordance with the latest updates from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.",

            "text": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by various pathogens that are mostly transmitted through sexual intercourse. \n\nVaccination helps stimulate the immune response as well as defend against pathogenborne contagious diseases. The prediction and use of surface antigenic epitopes are critical for the development of an efficient vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. Recently, using an in silico technique to work with bacterial pathogens, many targets have been found that are drug resistant or for which no vaccination is available [25]. In the post-genomic age, reverse vaccinology is a common and popular method for quickly identifying new vaccine targets [26,27]. In this study, we mainly used reverse vaccinology and subtractive genomics. We are primarily interested in identifying potential vaccines and therapeutic targets for syphilis disease. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that our followed approach has been reported as a successful method for proteome filtration and vaccine candidates selection in several targeted bacteria including Klebsiella Pneumoniae [81], Staphylococcus aureus [82], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [83], Shigella flexneri [84], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [85] and Moraxella catarrhalis [86]. Furthermore, the vaccine generated showed protective functions when it was validated by wet laboratory techniques. For example, a vaccine designed against Echinococcus granulosus through an immunoinformatic approach has activated mice humoral immunity and cellular immunity and has good antigenicity and immunogenicity [87]. Furthermore, the evaluation of a multitope vaccine against uropathogenic Escherichia coli showed that IgG and IgA antibody levels improved in serum and mucosal samples from vaccinated mice [88]. It is important to mention that the current study has applied an in silico approach for the design and evaluation of the potential vaccine; given the limitations of our method, we were very stringent and only chose top candidate epitopes confirmed by multiple tools. While immunoinformatics integrated with the reverse vaccinology approach was used to propose the potential vaccine of the current study and it was predicted immunogenic, future wet lab experiments are essential to comprehensively validate our findings.",

            "text": "are available. Candidate dengue vaccine development has been based on a variety of technologies including live attenuated virus, recombinant proteins, chimeric vaccines, recombinant viral vectors and DNA vaccines 3 . Epitopes are the regions of an antigen that are bound by antigen-specific adaptive immune membrane receptors on lymphocytes or by secreted antibodies. Epitopes provide valuable information for disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment 4 , and also represent a new strategy for prophylactic and therapeutic induction of pathogenspecific immunity 5 . Epitope-based vaccines (EVs) can induce both cellular (T-cell epitopes) and humoral (B-cell epitopes) immune responses. T-cell epitopes bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and interact with the T-cell receptor, stimulating a T-cell response. B-cell epitopes interact with antibodies. Recognition of the appropriate peptide-MHC complexes by the antigen-specific receptor of T-lymphocytes leads to cell proliferation and a cascade of cellular immune responses 6 . MHC-II molecules bind longer peptides (15-20 amino acids), whereas MHC-I molecules bind shorter peptides (9 amino acids or less) 7 . Prediction of such epitope binding is critical. Hence, various computational algorithms and methods have been used for the prediction of epitopes 8 and mostly conserved epitopes should be considered for vaccine development 9 . \n\nThe identification of immunodominant antigenic regions has significantly advanced the development of peptide-based vaccines. Potential advantages of the epitope-based approach include increased safety and the opportunity to rationally engineer epitopes for increased potency and breadth 10 . Antigenic regions induce a more specific immune response to a disease compared to other vaccination methods 11 . Computational approaches in predicting epitopes are an alternative to the expensive experimental discovery. However, computational methods may not predict functional protective epitopes due to variation among epitopic regions across strains or serotypes. Advantages of computational prediction of highly conserved epitopes for use in vaccines are the time saved and the safety of such vaccines 10 .",

            "text": "Since Edward Jenner first vaccinated an 8 year old boy in 1796 by inoculating fresh cowpox lesion matter (21), enormous leaps forward have been made in the field of vaccine development. Empirical approaches like attenuation and inactivation of microorganisms were the first steps forward to modern vaccinology (22). Recently, new technologies such as glycoconjugates and the introduction of novel vaccine adjuvants changed the field of vaccines, however the biggest change came with the first sequencing of the Heamophilus influenzae whole genome in 1995, a discovery that allowed the birth of \"Reverse Vaccinology, \" a genome-based approach to vaccine development (23,24). This approach, following the sequencing and analysis of the Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain whole genome, allowed the identification of novel candidates and the development of a four-component meningococcus B vaccine (4CMenB) (25,26). This recently licensed vaccine has already shown incredible effectiveness in the UK with 82.9% protection against all MenB strains in infants (27). The evolution of vaccine development further moved forward with the advancement of new methodologies and technological breakthroughs. Indeed, in 2016 the \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\" entered the stage. With this approach, the human immune system is analyzed at a single cell level allowing the characterization of the antibody response like never before (28). The gain of knowledge acquired by this approach allows to identify highly immunogenic antigens to develop novel and more efficacious vaccine candidates. The RSV fusion protein (F) case is a major example of the phenomenal power of the reverse vaccinology 2.0. Indeed, human B cells were directly isolated from RSV convalescent donors and cultured to naturally produce human monoclonal antibodies (humAbs). Among all the antibodies screened for RSV neutralization in vitro, the humAbs named D25 resulted in the most potent antibody with a median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.1 ng/ml (100-150 times more than palivizumab, the only monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for RSV prevention in infants) (29).",

            "text": "Ever since the discovery by Edward Jenner, more than two centuries ago, that vaccinia virus could be used to protect people from variola, vaccines have been of utmost importance in fighting infectious diseases [1], as they are the most cost effective tools for the prevention of infectious diseases. To date several types of vaccines are available, including live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit or split, toxoid, conjugate, DNA, and recombinant vectored vaccines [2]. While conventional vaccines, like live-attenuated or inactivated wild-type, have successfully protected vaccinees from various infectious diseases over the years, they are not available for most infectious diseases and for those who cannot afford them.\n\nConventional vaccine production methods, which predominantly use viruses and bacteria or their products, produced with classical production methods, are labour intensive, expensive, and time consuming, while some of the desired antigens cannot be produced in this way [3]. Furthermore, highly virulent pathogens can only be produced under expensive special safety conditions, while attenuated agents may have a tendency of reverting to their pathogenic form and can usually only be used in fully competent individuals [4].\n\nTo overcome the challenges of traditional vaccine production, the development and use of novel generations of vaccines, like those based on GM technologies, are being considered more and more frequently. The advent of these novel technologies may also be expected to create opportunities for the development of vaccines targeting new indications and/or application fields. Since there are many major indications for which no or only unsatisfactory vaccines are available, like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, the exploitation of novel technologies, like the use of vector-based vac-cine candidates or vector-based production of protective antigens, may eventually allow us to fill the gap of this unmet medical need. To date several vaccines for humans, based on GM technologies have been licensed (for review see e.g. [5][6][7][8]) and a lot of candidates are in the pipeline.\n\nAn interesting approach for vaccine development based on GM technology is the use of vectors, which carry selected genes encoding antigens that induce protective immunity. They can either be used as vaccines proper, or for the production of antigens that are incorporated in vaccines. The present paper only",

The \u201cYLQPRTFLL\u201d peptide sequence (position 269\u2013277) which was predicted to be a B cell epitope and likewise a strong binder of the HLA*A\u20100201 was selected for the design of the vaccine candidate, having satisfied series of antigenicity assessments. Through the codon optimization protocol, the nucleotide sequence for the vaccine candidate design was generated and targeted at the human toll\u2010like receptor 7 (TLR7). Bioinformatics analyses showed that the sequence \u201cUACCUGCAGCCGCGUACCUUCCUGCUG\u201d exhibited a strong affinity and likewise was bound to a stable cavity in the TLR7 pocket. This study is therefore expected to contribute to the research efforts directed at securing definitive preventive measures against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.",

A variety of formulations and vaccinology approaches are being pursued for targeting the spike glycoprotein, including simian and human replication\u2010defective adenoviral vaccines, subunit protein vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines and whole\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Here, we directed a reverse vaccinology approach towards the design of a nucleic acid (mRNA\u2010based) vaccine candidate. The \u201cYLQPRTFLL\u201d peptide sequence (position 269\u2013277) which was predicted to be a B cell epitope and likewise a strong binder of the HLA*A\u20100201 was selected for the design of the vaccine candidate, having satisfied series of antigenicity assessments. Through the codon optimization protocol, the nucleotide sequence for the vaccine candidate design was generated and targeted at the human toll\u2010like receptor 7 (TLR7). Bioinformatics analyses showed that the sequence \u201cUACCUGCAGCCGCGUACCUUCCUGCUG\u201d exhibited a strong affinity and likewise was bound to a stable cavity in the TLR7 pocket. This study is therefore expected to contribute to the research efforts directed at securing definitive preventive measures against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.",

Historically, the process of vaccine development through to licensure requires decades; however, clinicians and public health officials are often faced with outbreaks of viral diseases, sometimes of a pandemic nature that would require vaccines for adequate control. New viral diseases emerge from zoonotic and vectorborne sources, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Chikungunya, and while these diseases are often detected in resource-rich countries, they usually begin in lowand mid-income countries.1 Therefore, part of the timeline for a vaccine involves surveillance and detection of new pathogens in remote areas and transfer of specimens to laboratories capable of vaccine development. Development of vaccines for viral infections has historically been an empirical and iterative process based on the use of attenuated or inactivated whole virus. This requires unique methods of cultivation for each virus, development of animal models for vaccine testing, and a prolonged process of fine-tuning product formulation and immunogenicity, and for live-attenuated vaccines, pathogenicity. Thus, preclinical vaccine development can take years, followed by several more years of early-phase clinical testing and defining of dose and schedule. Moreover, efficacy testing and registration with regulatory agencies often takes another 5 to 10 years. In total, 15 to 20 years would be a typical timeframe from virus discovery to vaccineavailability iftheprocessproceedssmoothlyandthere are no major biological or logistical challenges. Fortunately, during the last decade, there have been substantial technological advances for conceiving, developing, manufacturing, and delivering vaccines. Rapid genetic sequencing allows both early identification of new pathogens and the identity of the genes encoding structural proteins that can form the basis for vaccine immunogen development. Also, rapid isolation of human monoclonal antibodies has proven to be extremely helpful in defining epitopes that are the targets of protective immunity. Additional tools of modern vaccinology include (1) delineation of atomic-level structures of viral proteins that facilitates structure-enabled immunogen design and protein engineering; (2) cell sorting and sequencing technologies that allow single-cell analysis of immune responses; and (3) genetic knock-in technologies that allow construction of animal models with human antibody genes for vaccine testing. These tools have already provided the potential not only for solving longstanding problems in vaccinology, such as the development of a new candidate vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, but they have facilitated rapid development of new candidate vaccines for emerging pathogens such as the Zika virus and pandemic strains of influenza virus. Synthetic vaccinology and platform manufacturing are important innovations that can speed the initial vaccine immunogen design and vaccine development process, and shorten the time needed for manufacturing and initial regulatory approval to begin phase 1 testing. Synthetic vaccinology is the process of using viral gene sequence information to accelerate vaccine development.2 For example, if a new influenza virus emerges anywhere in the world and is identified through genomic sequencing, the digitally transferred information can be used to synthesize nucleic acids encoding the viral surface proteins (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase). The process of gene synthesis is now extremely rapid and relatively inexpensive. Thus, within a few weeks, DNA plasmids encoding viral proteins can be available for preclinical testing. These genetic vectors (DNA and mRNA) can be used directly for immunization whereby intramuscular immunization leads to muscle cells producing the viral proteins. Alternatively, the genetic vectors can be used to express recombinant protein antigens, in vitro, that can be used for immunization. Similarly, if an outbreak of a new flavivirus becomes an epidemic or even a pandemic threat, as with Zika in 2015, the gene sequences that encode the viral surface proteins premembrane and envelope can be rapidly identified and form the basis for vaccine immunogen design strategies, based on prior knowledge of flavivirus structure and mechanisms of neutralization.3 Once a structurally authentic immunogen is available, the protein or genetic vectors encoding the protein can be used to immunize animals. In addition, the vaccine proteins can be used as probes to identify monoclonal antibodies secreted by B cells of convalescent humans. Such antibodies are valuable not only for refining vaccine immunogen designs, but also for development of diagnostic assays and potentially for use in passive transfer as therapeutic agents. Thus, development of reagents, diagnostics, candidate vaccines, and immune assessment assays can be done without having the actual virus in hand. This has particular value for viruses with extreme pathogenicity because it avoids the need for high-level containment in laboratory and manufacturing facilities. Platform manufacturing technologies allow more rapidproductionandclinicalimplementationoncethevaccine immunogen design is established. The term platform is used in many ways; however, in vaccine production, VIEWPOINT",

Additional tools of modern vaccinology include (1) delineation of atomic-level structures of viral proteins that facilitates structure-enabled immunogen design and protein engineering; (2) cell sorting and sequencing technologies that allow single-cell analysis of immune responses; and (3) genetic knock-in technologies that allow construction of animal models with human antibody genes for vaccine testing. These tools have already provided the potential not only for solving longstanding problems in vaccinology, such as the development of a new candidate vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, but they have facilitated rapid development of new candidate vaccines for emerging pathogens such as the Zika virus and pandemic strains of influenza virus. Synthetic vaccinology and platform manufacturing are important innovations that can speed the initial vaccine immunogen design and vaccine development process, and shorten the time needed for manufacturing and initial regulatory approval to begin phase 1 testing. Synthetic vaccinology is the process of using viral gene sequence information to accelerate vaccine development.2 For example, if a new influenza virus emerges anywhere in the world and is identified through genomic sequencing, the digitally transferred information can be used to synthesize nucleic acids encoding the viral surface proteins (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase). The process of gene synthesis is now extremely rapid and relatively inexpensive. Thus, within a few weeks, DNA plasmids encoding viral proteins can be available for preclinical testing. These genetic vectors (DNA and mRNA) can be used directly for immunization whereby intramuscular immunization leads to muscle cells producing the viral proteins. Alternatively, the genetic vectors can be used to express recombinant protein antigens, in vitro, that can be used for immunization. Similarly, if an outbreak of a new flavivirus becomes an epidemic or even a pandemic threat, as with Zika in 2015, the gene sequences that encode the viral surface proteins premembrane and envelope can be rapidly identified and form the basis for vaccine immunogen design strategies, based on prior knowledge of flavivirus structure and mechanisms of neutralization.3 Once a structurally authentic immunogen is available, the protein or genetic vectors encoding the protein can be used to immunize animals. In addition, the vaccine proteins can be used as probes to identify monoclonal antibodies secreted by B cells of convalescent humans. Such antibodies are valuable not only for refining vaccine immunogen designs, but also for development of diagnostic assays and potentially for use in passive transfer as therapeutic agents. Thus, development of reagents, diagnostics, candidate vaccines, and immune assessment assays can be done without having the actual virus in hand. This has particular value for viruses with extreme pathogenicity because it avoids the need for high-level containment in laboratory and manufacturing facilities. Platform manufacturing technologies allow more rapidproductionandclinicalimplementationoncethevaccine immunogen design is established. The term platform is used in many ways; however, in vaccine production, VIEWPOINT",

In 2015 malaria claimed about 429 000 lives, mostly among children below five year of age in sub\u2010Saharan Africa, and caused 212 million clinical episodes in a population of approximately 3.3 billion people living in regions at risk of infection. The development of an effective malaria vaccine is recognized as one of the most promising approaches for preventing infections and reducing transmission. To date, there is no vaccine on the market for prevention of malaria and only a few candidate vaccines were able to induce some protective efficacy. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate the pace of design and development of new malaria vaccine candidates that induce broad and long-lasting protective immunity. Reverse vaccinology and structural vaccinology are two complementary techniques that hold much promise in this regard. \nThe pathogenesis of malaria is primarily associated with blood-stage infection and there is strong evidence that antibodies specific for parasite blood-stage antigens can control parasitemia. This provides a strong rationale for incorporation of asexual blood-stage antigen components into an effective multivalent malaria subunit vaccine. \n \nIn this thesis, we exploited the great potential of the \u2018omics\u2019 sciences for the selection of hypothetical surface-exposed protein and the evaluation of their potential as vaccine candidate antigens. For the characterization of selected antigens we have exploited an entirely cell-based, rapid and reliable approach for the generation of antigen-specific and parasite cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): (I) generation of mammalian cell lines expressing high levels of the selected predicted malaria antigens as transmembrane proteins; (II) living\u00ad-cell immunization of mice; (III) generation of hybridoma cell lines producing mAbs capable of recognizing the endogenous antigen in its native context. \nThis strategy has led us to the identification of the Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine-\u00adRich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) as promising blood\u00ad-stage malaria vaccine candidate: (I) PfCyRPA has limited natural immunogenicity, (II) is highly conserved among P. falciparum isolates and (III) forms together with the Reticulocyte-binding Homolog 5 (PfRH5) and the PfRH5-interacting Protein (PfRipr) a multiprotein complex crucial for P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion; (IV) PfCyRPA-specific mAbs showed parasite in vitro growth\u00ad-inhibitory activity due to inhibition of merozoite invasion; (V) passive immunization experiments in P. falciparum infected NOD\u00adscid IL2R\u03b3null mice engrafted with human erythrocytes demonstrated in vivo growth-\u00adinhibitory activity of PfCyRPA specific mAbs. \n \nTo investigate whether growth inhibitory anti\u00adPfCyRPA and anti\u00adPfRH5 Abs can be induced by active immunization with the adjuvanted recombinant proteins, PfCyRPA and PfRH5 were recombinantly expressed as soluble protein in mammalian and insect cells respectively, purified from culture supernatant and employed for immunization of mice. mAbs raised against recombinant PfCyRPA and PfRH5 proteins showed potent parasite growth-\u00adinhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in a vaccine. \n \nTo examine the 3D structure of PfCyRPA and to explore the dynamics of its surface loops, we generated co-crystals of it in complex with an inhibitory mAb and elucidated the 3D structure of PfCyRPA and of the epitope\u2013paratope interface by X-ray crystallography. Elucidation of the structure of the epitope recognized by the protective mAb will strongly facilitate design of peptidomimetics in a structural vaccinology approach. The overall structure of PfCyRPA is a six-bladed \u03b2-propeller with each blade of the propeller being a four-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet. The five disulfide bonds of the protein are located within blades 1-5, stabilizing each individual blade. Since the 6th blade is composed of \u03b2-strands both from the N- and the C-terminus and has no disulfide bond, PfCyRPA has the potential to undergo large conformational changes by disassembly of blade 6. \n \nAmong additional hypothetical antigens investigated in the framework of this thesis, PF14_0044 showed interesting features: while none of the generated PF14_0044-specific mAbs significantly inhibited parasite growth, a synergistic in vitro inhibitory activity was observed when anti-PF14_0044 mAbs were combined with anti-PfCyRPA mAbs.

Given the persistent nature of tinea cruris, vaccination emerges as a promising strategy for fungal infection management, offering targeted, durable protection against various fungal species. Vaccines stimulate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity and are administered prophylactically to prevent infections while minimizing the risk of antifungal resistance development.

This study explores the complete proteome of T. rubrum, identifying potential protein candidates for vaccine development through reverse vaccinology. Immunogenic epitopes from these candidates were mapped and integrated into multitope vaccines and reverse translated to construct mRNA vaccines. Then, the mRNA was translated and computationally assessed for physicochemical, chemical, and immunological attributes.

Furthermore, immune simulations of vaccines with and without adjuvant demonstrated activation of immune responses, evidenced by elevated levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgM antibodies, cytokines, and interleukins. There was no significant change in antibody production between vaccines with and without adjuvants, but adjuvants are crucial for activating the innate immune response via TLRs.

The isolated 11-amino-acid peptide probe was predicted to retain the native three-dimensional (3D) conformation seen within the Luk holotoxin. Indeed, this peptide was recognized by the selecting anti-Luk MAb, and, using mutated peptides, we showed that a particular amino acid side chain was essential for these interactions. Furthermore, murine immunization with this peptide elicited IgG responses that were highly reactive with both the autologous synthetic peptide and the full-length Luk toxin homologues. Thus, using a gene fragment- and phage display-based pipeline, we have identified and validated immunogenic B-cell epitopes that are cross-reactive between members of the pore-forming leukocidin family. This approach could be harnessed to identify novel epitopes for a much-needed S. aureus-protective subunit vaccine.",

We have made outstanding progress in the identification of novel protective antigens that have been incorporated into the gold nanoparticle platform and used as vaccines. ABSTRACT Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 remains a pathogen of significance and high consequence around the world. This outcome is due in part to the high economic impact associated with massive, contaminated product recalls, prevalence of the pathogen in carrier reservoirs, disease sequelae, and mortality associated with several outbreaks worldwide. Furthermore, the contraindication of antibiotic use for the treatment of EHEC-related infections makes this pathogen a primary candidate for the development of effective prophylactic vaccines. However, no vaccines are approved for human use, and many have failed to provide a high degree of efficacy or broad protection, thereby opening an avenue for the use of new technologies to produce a safe, effective, and protective vaccine. Building on our previous studies using reverse vaccinology-predicted antigens, we refine a formulation, evaluate new immunogenic antigens, and further expand our understanding about the mechanism of EHEC vaccine-mediated protection. In the current study, we exploit the use of the nanotechnology platform based on gold nanoparticles (AuNP), which can act as a scaffold for the delivery of various antigens. Our results demonstrate that a refined vaccine formulation incorporating EHEC antigen LomW, EscC, LpfA1, or LpfA2 and delivered using AuNPs can elicit robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses associated with reduced EHEC colonization in vivo. Furthermore, our in vitro mechanistic studies further support that antibody-mediated protection is primarily driven by inhibition of bacterial adherence onto intestinal epithelial cells and by promotion of macrophage uptake and killing.

We have made outstanding progress in the identification of novel protective antigens that have been incorporated into the gold nanoparticle platform and used as vaccines.

Sequence variation of surface-exposed proteins and cross-reactivity of the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide with human tissues have hampered efforts to develop a successful vaccine. To overcome these obstacles, the entire genome sequence of a virulent serogroup B strain (MC58) was used to identify vaccine candidates. A total of 350 candidate antigens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and used to immunize mice. The sera allowed the identification of proteins that are surface exposed, that are conserved in sequence across a range of strains, and that induce a bactericidal antibody response, a property known to correlate with vaccine efficacy in humans."

Currently there are two major approaches for delivery of genetic material, viral and non-viral. The majority of on-going clinical trials in gene therapy or DNA vaccines use retroviruses and adenoviruses for delivering genetic materials. Viral delivery systems are far more effective than non-viral delivery however there are concerns regarding toxicity, immunogenicity and possible integration of viral genetic material into the human genome. Given the negative charge of the phosphate backbone of DNA, polycationic molecules have been the major focus as carriers of DNA. There are several physiological barriers to overcome for effective systemic delivery of DNA. The ideal vector must be stable in the systemic circulation, escape the reticuloendothelial system, able to extravasate tissues, enter the target cell, escape lysosomal degradation and transport DNA to the nucleus to be transcribed. With increasing understanding of the physicochemical properties essential to overcome the various barriers, it is possible to apply rational design to the cationic carriers. A number of poly-amino acids, cationic block co-polymers, dendrimers and cyclodextrins have been rationally designed to optimize gene delivery. This review will discuss approaches that have been used to design various synthetic polycations with enhanced DNA condensing ability, serum stability and endosomolytic capability for efficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo."

The potential for seasonal protection arising from a single injection of antibodies is appealing and has been pursued for a number of infectious agents. However, until recently, antibody-based strategies to combat infectious agents have been hampered due to the fact that most antibodies have been found to be strain specific, with the virus evolving resistance in many cases. The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in influenza, dengue virus, and HIV, which bind to multiple, structurally diverse strains, has provided renewed interest in this area. This review will focus on new technologies that enable the discovery of bNAbs, the challenges and opportunities of immunotherapies as an important addition to existing antiviral therapy, and the role of antibody discovery in informing rational vaccine discovery \u2013 with agents targeting influenza specifically addressed. Multiple candidates have entered the clinic and raise the possibility that a single antibody or small combination of antibodies can effectively neutralize a wide variety of strains. However, challenges remain \u2013 including combating escape variants, pharmacodynamics of antibody distribution, and development of efficacy biomarkers beyond virologic endpoints."

Polysaccharide-based vaccines have provided a degree of success in limiting morbidity from disseminated bacterial infections, including those caused by the major human obligate pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of these polysaccharide vaccines, such as partial coverage and induced escape leading to persistence of disease, provide a compelling argument for the development of protein vaccines.

The bane of conventional vaccines, such as those that include whole organisms or large proteins, appear to be the inclusion of unnecessary antigenic load that, not only contributes little to the protective immune response, but complicates the situation by inducing allergenic and/or reactogenic responses. Peptide vaccines are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses, consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences. Conversely, peptide vaccines used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting. In this article, we discuss the specific advantages and considerations in targeted induction of immune responses by peptide vaccines and progresses in the development of such vaccines against various diseases. Additionally, we also discuss the development of particulate carrier strategies and the inherent challenges with regard to safety when combining such technologies with peptide vaccines.",

Of these, the alpha, beta, and epsilon toxins are responsible for causing the most severe C. perfringens-related diseases in farm animals. The best way to control these diseases is through vaccination. However, commercially available vaccines are based on inactivated toxins and have many production drawbacks, which can be overcome through the use of recombinant antigens. In this study, we produced recombinant alpha, beta, and epsilon toxins in Escherichia coli to formulate a trivalent vaccine. Its effectiveness was evaluated through a potency test in rabbits, in which the vaccine generated 9.6, 24.4, and 25.0\u2009IU/mL of neutralizing antibodies against the respective toxins. Following this, cattle, sheep, and goats received the same formulation, generating, respectively, 5.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.48, 4.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43, and 4.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\u2009IU/mL against alpha toxin, 13.71\u2009\u00b1\u20091.17\u2009IU/mL (for all three species) against beta toxin, and 12.74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.70, 7.66\u2009\u00b1\u20091.69, and 8.91\u2009\u00b1\u20092.14\u2009IU/mL against epsilon toxin. These levels were above the minimum recommended by international protocols. As such, our vaccine was effective in generating protective antibodies and, thus, may represent an interesting alternative for the prevention of C. perfringens-related intoxications in farm animals."

However, prior infection or circulating maternal antibodies can also mediate a non-protective antibody response that can enhance the course of disease in a subsequent heterotypic infection. Naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies can help us understand the protective and pathogenic roles of the humoral immune system in dengue virus infection.ResultsEpstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of a human subject with previous dengue infection was performed. B cell cultures were screened by ELISA for antibodies to dengue (DENV) envelope (E) protein. ELISA positive cultures were cloned by limiting dilution. Three IgG1 human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) were purified and their binding specificity to E protein was verified by ELISA and biolayer interferometry. Neutralization and enhancement assays were conducted in epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines, respectively. All three HMAbs bound to E from at least two of the four DENV serotypes, one of the HMAbs was neutralizing, and all were able to enhance DENV infection.ConclusionsHMAbs against DENV can be successfully generated by EBV transformation of B cells from patients at least two years after naturally acquired DENV infections. These antibodies show different patterns of cross-reactivity, neutralizing, and enhancement activity."

Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach."

It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) (Bruno et al., 2015)(Flower et al., 2010)[196](Bagnoli et al., 2011). Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity (Bagnoli et al., 2011)(Patronov et al., 2013)(268386748)(Sela-Culang et al., 2015)(Vita et al., 2014)(Yao et al., 2013). Recombinant expression of the in-silico selected vaccine candidates and testing them for immunogenicity and protection in pre-clinical models are then the next steps (Figure 2) (Bruno et al., 2015).",

In spite of the continuing efforts in the past decade, the problem remains unsolved and therefore still attracts a lot of attention from bioinformaticists. Recently, several discontinuous epitope prediction servers became available, and it is intriguing to review all existing methods and evaluate their performances on the same benchmark. In addition, these methods are also compared against common binding site prediction algorithms, since they have been frequently used as substitutes in the absence of good epitope prediction methods.",
                    "[2187358 | Patronov et al. | 2013 | Citations: 371]": "Vaccination is generally considered to be the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases. All vaccinations work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system in order to evoke an immune response. The active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated (\u2018attenuated\u2019) forms of the causative pathogens (bacteria or viruses), or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic. The increased understanding of antigen recognition at molecular level has resulted in the development of rationally designed peptide vaccines. The concept of peptide vaccines is based on identification and chemical synthesis of B-cell and T-cell epitopes which are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. The accelerating growth of bioinformatics techniques and applications along with the substantial amount of experimental data has given rise to a new field, called immunoinformatics. Immunoinformatics is a branch of bioinformatics dealing with in silico analysis and modelling of immunological data and problems. Different sequence- and structure-based immunoinformatics methods are reviewed in the paper.",

There are four major reasons for this: (1) the lack of efficacious treatment for many devastating infections; (2) the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria; (3) the need for improving the safety of the more traditional licensed vaccines; and finally, (4) the great promise for innovative vaccine design and research with convergence of omics sciences, such as genomics, proteomics, immunomics, and vaccinology. Our first project based on omics was initiated in 2000 and was termed reverse vaccinology. At that time, antigen identification was mainly based on bioinformatic analysis of a singular genome. Since then, omics-guided approaches have been applied to its full potential in several proof-of-concept studies in the industry, with the first reverse vaccinology-derived vaccine now in late stage clinical trials and several vaccines developed by omics in preclinical studies. In the meantime, vaccine discovery and development has been further improved with the support of proteomics, functional genomics, comparative genomics, structural biology, and most recently vaccinomics. We illustrate in this review how omics biotechnologies and integrative biology are expected to accelerate the identification of vaccine candidates against difficult pathogens for which traditional vaccine development has thus far been failing, and how research will provide safer vaccines and improved formulations for immunocompromised patients in the near future. Finally, we present a discussion to situate omics-guided rational vaccine design in the broader context of global public health and how it can benefit citizens in both developed and developing countries.",

It is a discipline which applies informatic techniques to problems of the immune system. To a great extent, immunoinformatics is typified by epitope prediction methods. It has found disappointingly limited use in the design and discovery of new vaccines, which is an area where proper computational support is generally lacking. Most extant vaccines are not based around isolated epitopes but rather correspond to chemically-treated or attenuated whole pathogens or correspond to individual proteins extract from whole pathogens or correspond to complex carbohydrate. In this chapter we attempt to review what progress there has been in an as-yet-underexplored area of immunoinformatics: the computational discovery of whole protein antigens. The effective development of antigen prediction methods would significantly reduce the laboratory resource required to identify pathogenic proteins as candidate subunit vaccines. We begin our review by placing antigen prediction firmly into context, exploring the role of reverse vaccinology in the design and discovery of vaccines. We also highlight several competing yet ultimately complementary methodological approaches: sub-cellular location prediction, identifying antigens using sequence similarity, and the use of sophisticated statistical approaches for predicting the probability of antigen characteristics. We end by exploring how a systems immunomics approach to the prediction of immunogenicity would prove helpful in the prediction of antigens.",

Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity (Bagnoli et al., 2011)(Patronov et al., 2013)(268386748)(Sela-Culang et al., 2015)(Vita et al., 2014)(Yao et al., 2013).

Currently there are two major approaches for delivery of genetic material, viral and non-viral. The majority of on-going clinical trials in gene therapy or DNA vaccines use retroviruses and adenoviruses for delivering genetic materials. Viral delivery systems are far more effective than non-viral delivery however there are concerns regarding toxicity, immunogenicity and possible integration of viral genetic material into the human genome. Given the negative charge of the phosphate backbone of DNA, polycationic molecules have been the major focus as carriers of DNA. There are several physiological barriers to overcome for effective systemic delivery of DNA. The ideal vector must be stable in the systemic circulation, escape the reticuloendothelial system, able to extravasate tissues, enter the target cell, escape lysosomal degradation and transport DNA to the nucleus to be transcribed. With increasing understanding of the physicochemical properties essential to overcome the various barriers, it is possible to apply rational design to the cationic carriers. A number of poly-amino acids, cationic block co-polymers, dendrimers and cyclodextrins have been rationally designed to optimize gene delivery. This review will discuss approaches that have been used to design various synthetic polycations with enhanced DNA condensing ability, serum stability and endosomolytic capability for efficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo."

This approach can signifi cantly reduce the time necessary for the identifi cation of antigens for development of candidate vaccine and enables systematic identifi cation of all potential antigens even from pathogens which are diffi cult or currently impossible to culture. Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach. Nevertheless, once the protective antigen is identifi ed it enables scientists to systemically classify such antigens, and develop efficient preparations virtually against any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined.\n\nSubunit vaccines offer superior safety profi les and can be manufactured with minimal risk of contamination [ 4 , 5 ]. When coupled with appropriate adjuvants, they can also focus the immune response on protective or highly conserved antigenic determinants that may not elicit a potent response during natural infection or after vaccination with an inactivated or attenuated pathogen [ 6 , 7 ]."

It enables an approach termed \"reverse vaccinology,\" a genome-based unbiased discovery process for candidate vaccine antigens (Figure 2) (Bruno et al., 2015)(Flower et al., 2010)[196](Bagnoli et al., 2011). Rather than starting from live attenuated or inactivated microorganisms or drawing on prior knowledge about pathogen-host interaction, reverse vaccinology begins with an analysis of the microbial genome for open reading frames to reveal the putative proteome. This analysis can be refined in several ways to narrow down the number of candidate antigens to be tested in pre-clinical models: (1) Computational comparison will reveal the degree of protein conservation within and between microbial species; (2) tools predicting subcellular localization can be used for filtering out molecules accessible to antibodies, namely, proteins released by the microorganism or expressed on its surface; and (3) there are algorithms predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes and hence immunogenicity (Bagnoli et al., 2011)(Patronov et al., 2013)(268386748)(Sela-Culang et al., 2015)(Vita et al., 2014)(Yao et al., 2013).

In spite of the continuing efforts in the past decade, the problem remains unsolved and therefore still attracts a lot of attention from bioinformaticists. Recently, several discontinuous epitope prediction servers became available, and it is intriguing to review all existing methods and evaluate their performances on the same benchmark. In addition, these methods are also compared against common binding site prediction algorithms, since they have been frequently used as substitutes in the absence of good epitope prediction methods."

                            "Vaccination is generally considered to be the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases. All vaccinations work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system in order to evoke an immune response. The active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated (\u2018attenuated\u2019) forms of the causative pathogens (bacteria or viruses), or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic. The increased understanding of antigen recognition at molecular level has resulted in the development of rationally designed peptide vaccines. The concept of peptide vaccines is based on identification and chemical synthesis of B-cell and T-cell epitopes which are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. The accelerating growth of bioinformatics techniques and applications along with the substantial amount of experimental data has given rise to a new field, called immunoinformatics. Immunoinformatics is a branch of bioinformatics dealing with in silico analysis and modelling of immunological data and problems. Different sequence- and structure-based immunoinformatics methods are reviewed in the paper."

This new approach, called \"reverse vaccinology\" (Rappuoli, 2000), does not require cultivation of the original pathogen, thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms. It is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico, which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems. The resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological and/or functional studies to select the most promising candidates (e.g., able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies, capacity to confer protective immunity). Flanking studies are usually carried out, such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains, or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections (Singh et al., 2004)."

                            "Meningitis and sepsis caused by serogroup B meningococcus are two severe diseases that still cause significant mortality. To date there is no universal vaccine that prevents these diseases. In this work, five antigens discovered by reverse vaccinology were expressed in a form suitable for large-scale manufacturing and formulated with adjuvants suitable for human use. The vaccine adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide induced bactericidal antibodies in mice against 78% of a panel of 85 meningococcal strains representative of the global population diversity. The strain coverage could be increased to 90% and above by the addition of CpG oligonucleotides or by using MF59 as adjuvant. The vaccine has the potential to conquer one of the most devastating diseases of childhood."

The approach was conceptualized for the first time by Stephen Johnson and coworkers using DNA immunization, 3 subsequently proposed using protein immunization by L. Lissolo and coworkers (Abstracts WHO Conference 'Utilization of genomic information for tropical disease drug and vaccine discovery', Geneva, 1998; (Grandi, 2001) ), and finally demonstrated to be effective by Pizza and coworkers. 5 A Neisseria meningitidis Group B vaccine based on antigens (and Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), see below) selected by Reverse Vaccinology has recently been registered in Europe.

                            "Vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach."

                            "Vaccine research and development are experiencing a renaissance of interest from the global scientific community. There are four major reasons for this: (1) the lack of efficacious treatment for many devastating infections; (2) the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria; (3) the need for improving the safety of the more traditional licensed vaccines; and finally, (4) the great promise for innovative vaccine design and research with convergence of omics sciences, such as genomics, proteomics, immunomics, and vaccinology. Our first project based on omics was initiated in 2000 and was termed reverse vaccinology. At that time, antigen identification was mainly based on bioinformatic analysis of a singular genome. Since then, omics-guided approaches have been applied to its full potential in several proof-of-concept studies in the industry, with the first reverse vaccinology-derived vaccine now in late stage clinical trials and several vaccines developed by omics in preclinical studies. In the meantime, vaccine discovery and development has been further improved with the support of proteomics, functional genomics, comparative genomics, structural biology, and most recently vaccinomics. We illustrate in this review how omics biotechnologies and integrative biology are expected to accelerate the identification of vaccine candidates against difficult pathogens for which traditional vaccine development has thus far been failing, and how research will provide safer vaccines and improved formulations for immunocompromised patients in the near future. Finally, we present a discussion to situate omics-guided rational vaccine design in the broader context of global public health and how it can benefit citizens in both developed and developing countries."

This usually involves some complex combination of informatic-based prediction methodologies. Recombinant expression of the resulting set of identified molecules can overcome their reduced natural abundance, which has often prevented us recognising their true potential. By enlarging the repertoire of native antigens, this technology can help to foster the development of a new cohort of vaccines."

Therefore, harnessing the antibody component of a potent human humoral response to disseminated infection is valuable for the identification of novel protective antigens. This approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (RV 2.0) (Burton, 2002)(Rappuoli et al., 2016), relies on the isolation and recombinant expression of the variable regions of heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chain genes of immunoglobulin (focus has centerd on IgG) using a variety of molecular tools. Enriched by the development of high-throughput technologies, the screening of large numbers of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) is also advancing knowledge of host-pathogen interactive biology and auto-immunity (26,(Amara et al., 2018)."

                            "Preclinical vaccine development methods are enriched by detailed analysis of the human immune response to etiological agents of infectious diseases. For example, with the development of high-throughput technologies, deep sequencing of the gene segments encoding the variable regions of antibody heavy (VH) and light (VL = \u03ba or \u03bb) chains in a given B cell repertoire is providing valuable information useful in understanding adaptive immunity to infections, autoimmunity, and malignancies (Dekosky et al., 2013)(Georgiou et al., 2014). Identifying the targets of antibodies of interest by cloning and in vitro expression of VH and VL chains of B-cell antibodies is a powerful approach, which can be utilized to inform on the functional immunogenicity of both known and novel antigens. The use of this approach, termed reverse vaccinology 2.0 (26), in the cloning of neutralizing human recombinant monoclonal antibodies [human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs)] from patients convalescing from viral infectious diseases is well documented; the first studies in the use of reverse vaccinology 2.0 focused on the isolation and functional characterization of antibodies targeting the dengue, HIV, and influenza viruses (Schieffelin et al., 2010)(Wrammert et al., 2008)(Wu et al., 2010). The power of the approach lies in the expression of paired VH and VL regions from individual plasmablasts or memory B cells; the output being the expression of hmAbs mimicking natural VH + VL combinations induced in the host."

Information gained from high-throughput DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes (Ig-seq) can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high sensitivity, to discover antibodies specific for antigens of interest, to guide vaccine development and to understand autoimmunity. Rapid progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different laboratories."

In particular, whole genome sequencing has revolutionized vaccinology, translating genomic information to vaccine candidates, through a process termed \"reverse vaccinology\". The next phase of this once fresh approach-known as \"reverse vaccinology 2.0\"-now assembles a more multi-faceted, seamless pipeline of complementary disciplines that 1) pre-screens human donors 2) identifies and sequences B cell receptors of highly specific or broadly reactive B cells 3) expresses these sequences as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 4) structurally and functionally characterizes the targeted antibody epitopes. However, this pathway not only applies to the development of vaccines immunogens, but is now the basis to rapidly scale prophylactic and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as well (Georgiou et al., 2014)(Rappuoli et al., 2016)."

Using sequence information of antibody variable regions, the interaction of antibodies with their target antigen can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. The protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format, such as nanoparticle technologies or adjuvants. Finally, this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans."

However, prior infection or circulating maternal antibodies can also mediate a non-protective antibody response that can enhance the course of disease in a subsequent heterotypic infection. Naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies can help us understand the protective and pathogenic roles of the humoral immune system in dengue virus infection.ResultsEpstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of a human subject with previous dengue infection was performed. B cell cultures were screened by ELISA for antibodies to dengue (DENV) envelope (E) protein. ELISA positive cultures were cloned by limiting dilution. Three IgG1 human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) were purified and their binding specificity to E protein was verified by ELISA and biolayer interferometry. Neutralization and enhancement assays were conducted in epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines, respectively. All three HMAbs bound to E from at least two of the four DENV serotypes, one of the HMAbs was neutralizing, and all were able to enhance DENV infection.ConclusionsHMAbs against DENV can be successfully generated by EBV transformation of B cells from patients at least two years after naturally acquired DENV infections. These antibodies show different patterns of cross-reactivity, neutralizing, and enhancement activity."

The isolation of these antibodies, most of which are rarely induced in human infections, has primarily been achieved by large-scale screening for suitable donors and new single B cell approaches to human monoclonal antibody generation. Engineering the antibodies to improve half-life and effector functions has further augmented their in vivo activity in some cases. Super-antibodies offer promise for the prophylaxis and therapy of infections with a range of viruses, including those that are highly antigenically variable and those that are newly emerging or that have pandemic potential.

These include antibodies targeting the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stalk, HIV V2 and V3 glycans, and Dengue envelope protein <Paper corpusId=\"201019732\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"7627323\" paperTitle=\"(Shriver et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This information has been used to graft both linear and discontinuous epitopes onto computationally designed scaffolds, creating designer antigens with enhanced immunogenicity <Paper corpusId=\"201019732\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches enable comprehensive profiling of antibody repertoires induced by these designer antigens, facilitating the identification of additional bNAbs and further refinement of antigens <Paper corpusId=\"201019732\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCurrent strategies in vaccine antigen identification employ reverse vaccinology approaches to select promising glyco- or protein-derived antigens based on structural studies of the target epitopes recognized by potent antibodies <Paper corpusId=\"233388611\" paperTitle=\"(Schijns et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10823671\" paperTitle=\"(Rappuoli et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Rational, structure-guided vaccine design can also involve developing structurally simpler immunogens that present well-defined minimal epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.

                            "Passive immunization using antibodies is a promising alternative to other antiviral treatment options. The potential for seasonal protection arising from a single injection of antibodies is appealing and has been pursued for a number of infectious agents. However, until recently, antibody-based strategies to combat infectious agents have been hampered due to the fact that most antibodies have been found to be strain specific, with the virus evolving resistance in many cases. The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in influenza, dengue virus, and HIV, which bind to multiple, structurally diverse strains, has provided renewed interest in this area. This review will focus on new technologies that enable the discovery of bNAbs, the challenges and opportunities of immunotherapies as an important addition to existing antiviral therapy, and the role of antibody discovery in informing rational vaccine discovery \u2013 with agents targeting influenza specifically addressed. Multiple candidates have entered the clinic and raise the possibility that a single antibody or small combination of antibodies can effectively neutralize a wide variety of strains. However, challenges remain \u2013 including combating escape variants, pharmacodynamics of antibody distribution, and development of efficacy biomarkers beyond virologic endpoints."

Rational, structure-guided vaccine design can also involve the development of structurally simpler immunogens that present well-defined minimal epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, serving as epitope mimics for elicitation of more focused immune responses (Correia et al., 2014). When refined recombinant or synthetic subunit vaccines are designed, the structural features of the antigen may strongly impact the desired antibody-response."

Several major pathogens have resisted traditional vaccine development, although vulnerable epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies have been identified for several such cases. Hence, new vaccine design methods to induce epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies are needed. Here we show, with a neutralization epitope from respiratory syncytial virus, that computational protein design can generate small, thermally and conformationally stable protein scaffolds that accurately mimic the viral epitope structure and induce potent neutralizing antibodies. These scaffolds represent promising leads for the research and development of a human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed to protect infants, young children and the elderly. More generally, the results provide proof of principle for epitope-focused and scaffold-based vaccine design, and encourage the evaluation and further development of these strategies for a variety of other vaccine targets, including antigenically highly variable pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and influenza."

Mimics of natural infection, including live attenuated and killed pathogens, which induce such antibodies in vivo, have generated highly successful vaccines. However, pathogens that induce functional antibodies at lower levels or more sporadically have been more refractory to vaccine design. Such pathogens are being tackled by more systematic approaches involving identifying functional antibodies, templating immunogens from the antibodies, and then evaluating the immunogens iteratively. I believe this is a powerful new approach to vaccine design as discussed below."

The application of recombinant DNA technology in subunit vaccine development has addressed many safety concerns associated with traditional vaccines by eliminating the need to work with intact pathogens. Instead, these vaccines utilize specific protein antigens or epitopes produced through recombinant DNA techniques, focusing the immune response on protective components while avoiding reactogenic or allergenic sequences <Paper corpusId=\"31827531\" paperTitle=\"(Bs et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11616975\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe efficacy of subunit vaccines depends not only on the selection of appropriate antigens but also on their formulation with suitable adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. Since recombinant antigens alone may not elicit sufficiently strong immune responses, adjuvants play a crucial role in boosting the protective effect of these vaccines <Paper corpusId=\"31827531\" paperTitle=\"(Bs et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combination approach has proven successful in various applications, including the development of a trivalent vaccine against Clostridium perfringens toxins. In this case, researchers produced recombinant alpha, beta, and epsilon toxins in Escherichia coli and demonstrated their ability to generate protective levels of neutralizing antibodies in rabbits, cattle, sheep, and goats <Paper corpusId=\"31827531\" paperTitle=\"(Bs et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6496809\" paperTitle=\"(Moreira et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA significant advantage of recombinant subunit vaccines is their production efficiency and consistency. Unlike traditional vaccine manufacturing processes that involve growing and inactivating pathogens, recombinant technology enables the production of large quantities of highly purified antigens in expression systems such as E. coli. This approach overcomes many production drawbacks associated with inactivated toxin-based vaccines, resulting in more consistent and safer products <Paper corpusId=\"31827531\" paperTitle=\"(Bs et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6496809\" paperTitle=\"(Moreira et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe development of peptide-based vaccines represents a further refinement of the subunit vaccine concept. These vaccines use short peptide fragments to induce highly targeted immune responses while avoiding unnecessary antigenic load that might contribute to allergenic or reactogenic effects. Though peptide vaccines may be weakly immunogenic when used alone, their combination with particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting can overcome this limitation <Paper corpusId=\"31827531\" paperTitle=\"(Bs et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11616975\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

In view of the fact that antigens obtained abundantly not necessarily be the good vaccine candidates (Flower, 2009). In order to improve vaccine efficacy, rational preclinical development of recombinant antigens and improved protocols for predicting the immunogenicity of antigens is an important endeavour. The efficacy of majority of the vaccine candidates prepared from purified recombinant antigens and peptides depends on the antigens alone, the success of subunit vaccines also depends on the adjuvants added to vaccine formulations to boost the immune response to the antigen (Moreira et al., 2016)(Li et al., 2014)."

The bane of conventional vaccines, such as those that include whole organisms or large proteins, appear to be the inclusion of unnecessary antigenic load that, not only contributes little to the protective immune response, but complicates the situation by inducing allergenic and/or reactogenic responses. Peptide vaccines are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses, consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences. Conversely, peptide vaccines used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting. In this article, we discuss the specific advantages and considerations in targeted induction of immune responses by peptide vaccines and progresses in the development of such vaccines against various diseases. Additionally, we also discuss the development of particulate carrier strategies and the inherent challenges with regard to safety when combining such technologies with peptide vaccines."

                            "Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic bacterium that produces several toxins. Of these, the alpha, beta, and epsilon toxins are responsible for causing the most severe C. perfringens-related diseases in farm animals. The best way to control these diseases is through vaccination. However, commercially available vaccines are based on inactivated toxins and have many production drawbacks, which can be overcome through the use of recombinant antigens. In this study, we produced recombinant alpha, beta, and epsilon toxins in Escherichia coli to formulate a trivalent vaccine. Its effectiveness was evaluated through a potency test in rabbits, in which the vaccine generated 9.6, 24.4, and 25.0\u2009IU/mL of neutralizing antibodies against the respective toxins. Following this, cattle, sheep, and goats received the same formulation, generating, respectively, 5.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.48, 4.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43, and 4.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\u2009IU/mL against alpha toxin, 13.71\u2009\u00b1\u20091.17\u2009IU/mL (for all three species) against beta toxin, and 12.74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.70, 7.66\u2009\u00b1\u20091.69, and 8.91\u2009\u00b1\u20092.14\u2009IU/mL against epsilon toxin. These levels were above the minimum recommended by international protocols. As such, our vaccine was effective in generating protective antibodies and, thus, may represent an interesting alternative for the prevention of C. perfringens-related intoxications in farm animals."

The reverse vaccinology approach significantly reduces the time required for antigen identification by utilizing genomic information to directly design and produce protective antigens using recombinant technology <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This systematic approach enables identification of potential antigens even from pathogens that are difficult or impossible to culture, expanding the range of diseases that can be targeted through vaccination <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, subunit vaccines developed through recombinant antibody technology offer superior safety profiles compared to traditional whole-pathogen vaccines. These vaccines can be manufactured with minimal risk of contamination and eliminate the need for handling dangerous live pathogens during production <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. When formulated with appropriate adjuvants, subunit vaccines can focus the immune response on protective or highly conserved antigenic determinants that may not naturally elicit potent responses during infection or after vaccination with inactivated or attenuated pathogens <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these advantages, recombinant antibody technology has notable limitations. The approach is restricted to identifying protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting other important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, a significant challenge in reverse vaccinology remains the identification of protective antigens that will induce effective immunity against the targeted pathogen <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. While computational methods can predict potential antigens, extensive experimental validation is still required to confirm their protective efficacy <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nNevertheless, once protective antigens are successfully identified, this approach enables scientists to systematically classify such antigens and develop efficient preparations against virtually any pathogen whose genome has been sequenced <Paper corpusId=\"101189902\" paperTitle=\"(Turanek et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This systematic capability represents a fundamental shift in vaccine development strategy from empirical to rational design approaches <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.",

                            "In comparison with conventional approaches which require a laborious process of attenuation or inactivation of pathogens, or selection of individual components important for induction of immune response, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility of using genomic information derived from in silico analyses for direct design and production of protective antigen using recombinant technology. This approach can signifi cantly reduce the time necessary for the identifi cation of antigens for development of candidate vaccine and enables systematic identifi cation of all potential antigens even from pathogens which are diffi cult or currently impossible to culture. Of course, this approach is limited to identifi cation of protein or glycoprotein antigens, omitting such important vaccine components such as polysaccharides and glycolipids. The principal question for reverse vaccinology consists in identifi cation of protective antigen, which presents the main hurdle of this approach. Nevertheless, once the protective antigen is identifi ed it enables scientists to systemically classify such antigens, and develop efficient preparations virtually against any pathogen that has had its genome sequence determined.\n\nSubunit vaccines offer superior safety profi les and can be manufactured with minimal risk of contamination [ 4 , 5 ]. When coupled with appropriate adjuvants, they can also focus the immune response on protective or highly conserved antigenic determinants that may not elicit a potent response during natural infection or after vaccination with an inactivated or attenuated pathogen [ 6 , 7 ]."
