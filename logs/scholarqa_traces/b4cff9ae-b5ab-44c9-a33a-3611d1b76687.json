Hecht et al. [13] (Weizmann Institute) applied findings generated in mice (Tchorsh-Yutsis et al.) [14] to a non-human primate model. The mouse studies had demonstrated the curative potential of such implants in diabetic mice under relatively tolerable immune suppression. A working hypothesis, suggesting that embryonic pig pancreas transplantation would not be adversely affected by a humoral response was based on 2 observations: 1) hyperacute and acute rejection are mainly mediated by complement activation in blood vessels, mediated by preformed anti-pig antibodies recognizing carbohydrates expressed on endothelial cells; and 2) data from the mouse studies showed that the embryonic pancreas implants predominantly induce host-type vasculature to support their growth and development in the recipient, resulting in an organ comprised mainly of porcine epithelial cells and host endothelium. It was found that that porcine E42 embryonic pancreatic tissue can correct hyperglycemia in diabetic Cynomolgous monkeys under a tolerable immune suppression protocol and was concluded that long-term proliferative capacity of these grafts, their ability to induce revascularization by host endothelium, and their reduced immunogenicity, suggest that porcine embryonic xenotransplantation could offer an attractive replacement therapy for diabetes [13,14]. Host immune suppression was required for successful engraftment of embryonic pig pancreas in rodents [14] or non-human primates [13] in the studies of Tchorsh-Yutsis et al. and Hecht et al. It is likely that one or more factors in the methodology we employ different from that used by these investigators is critical for engraftment without an immune suppression requirement.

Oral medication and exogenous insulin can only temporarily maintain blood glucose levels and do not cure the disease. Most patients need life-long injections of exogenous insulin. In recent years, advances in islet transplantation have significantly advanced the treatment of diabetes, allowing patients to discontinue exogenous insulin and avoid complications.Long-term follow-up results from recent reports on islet transplantation suggest that they provide significant therapeutic benefit although patients still require immunotherapy, suggesting the importance of future transplantation strategies. Although organ shortage remains the primary obstacle for the development of islet transplantation, new sources of islet cells, such as stem cells and porcine islet cells, have been proposed, and are gradually being incorporated into clinical research. Further research on new transplantation sites, such as the subcutaneous space and mesenteric fat, may eventually replace the traditional portal vein intra-islet cell infusion. Additionally, the immunological rejection reaction in islet transplantation will be resolved through the combined application of immunosuppressant agents, islet encapsulation technology, and the most promising mesenchymal stem cells/regulatory T cell and islet cell combined transplantation cell therapy. This review summarizes the progress achieved in islet transplantation, and discusses the research progress and potential solutions to the challenges faced.",

                    "text": "In the year 2000 the Edmonton protocol proved that clinical pancreatic islet allotransplantation (alloTx) can be successfully performed to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen [1]. Even if islet replacement could be considered a preferable alternative to insulin therapy in long-term diabetic patients, this therapeutic option will be practically limited by the number of islet donors that will never be sufficient. A possible solution to the problem of tissue supply may be found by investigating the potential of embryonic as well as induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functional insulinproducing cells. Clinical applications await successful testing in animal models. Alternatively, xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of pig islets is currently the most advanced and appealing approach with respect to a possible clinical application [2]. Pigs are the best candidates as human substitutes [3] for several reasons: pig insulin differs from human insulin by just one amino acid; pig islets have lower sensitivity to destruction by recurrent T1D autoimmunity than human islets [4], they do not accumulate amyloid [5], and pig donors can be genetically modified to improve immunomodulation and cytoprotection of pig islets. The experimental results of pig islets to non-human diabetic primates xenoTx are more encouraging than those obtained using pig whole organs, which makes their employment predictable in clinical trials in the next few years [6\u2022\u2022]. To make this technique a clinically feasible treatment option we need to generate more convincing preclinical data in the pig-to-primate xenoTx model.",

Bertera, M. Grupillo, M. Trucco, R. Bottino\n## Abstract\nThe therapy of type 1 diabetes is an open challenging problem. The restoration of normoglycemia and insulin independence in immunosuppressed type 1 diabetic recipients of islet allotransplantation has shown the potential of a cell-based diabetes therapy. Even if successful, this approach poses a problem of scarce tissue supply. Xenotransplantation can be the answer to this limited donor availability and, among possible candidate tissues for xenotransplantation, porcine islets are the closest to a future clinical application. Xenotransplantation, with pigs as donors, offers the possibility of using healthy, living, and genetically modified islets from pathogen-free animals available in unlimited number of islets. Several studies in the pig-to-nonhuman primate model demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical islet xenotransplantation and have provided insights into the critical events and possible mechanisms of immune recognition and rejection of xenogeneic islet grafts. Particularly promising results in the achievement of prolonged insulin independence were obtained with newly developed, genetically modified pigs islets able to produce immunoregulatory products, using different implantation sites, and new immunotherapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to generate additional safety and efficacy data in nonhuman primate models to safely translate these findings into the clinic.\n## Introduction\nIn the year 2000 the Edmonton protocol proved that clinical pancreatic islet allotransplantation (alloTx) can be successfully performed to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen [1]. Even if islet replacement could be considered a preferable alternative to insulin therapy in long-term diabetic patients, this therapeutic option will be practically limited by the number of islet donors that will never be sufficient. A possible solution to the problem of tissue supply may be found by investigating the potential of embryonic as well as induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functional insulinproducing cells. Clinical applications await successful testing in animal models. Alternatively, xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of pig islets is currently the most advanced and appealing approach with respect to a possible clinical application [2]. Pigs are the best candidates as human substitutes [3] for several reasons: pig insulin differs from human insulin by just one amino acid; pig islets have lower sensitivity to destruction by recurrent T1D autoimmunity than human islets [4], they do not accumulate amyloid [5], and pig donors can be genetically modified to improve immunomodulation and cytoprotection of pig islets. The experimental results of pig islets to non-human diabetic primates xenoTx are more encouraging than those obtained using pig whole organs, which makes their employment predictable in clinical trials in the next few years [6\u2022\u2022]. To make this technique a clinically feasible treatment option we need to generate more convincing preclinical data in the pig-to-primate xenoTx model.\n\n## Conclusions\nBuilding on the remarkable recent progress in the preclinical pig-to-NHP model, it appears that adult porcine islets have the best potential, from both a logistic and immunologic point of view, to reverse diabetes in NHPs and furthermore in humans. The simultaneous development of suitable sources of genetically modified pigs and more resistant-engineered pig islets, together with the establishment of clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimens, could be translated into tangible benefits for patients with T1D in the very near future. However, questions remain and detailed problems need to be adequately addressed.",

While islet-alone xenotransplantation strategies continue to show improvement with source pig genetic modifications and refinements to immunosuppression regimens, approaches like encapsulation which allow for reversal of diabetes without immunosuppression may be more clinically relevant. Porcine islet xenotransplantation, in conjunction with kidney xenotransplantation, remains a particularly compelling therapeutic possibility for patients with diabetic nephropathy who require both kidney and islet replacement, and who have already committed to immunosuppression for their kidney grafts. Composite islet-kidney transplantation has proven challenging in xenogeneic preclinical models; however, preliminary studies in islet-after-kidney xenotransplantation are promising and may point to a path forward with combined islet and kidney transplantation for diabetic nephropathy.",

The baboon recipient maintained normal serum creatinine with no evidence of rejection for six months following kidney and islet transplant but was euthanized due to sepsis related to pyelonephritis in setting of stent occlusion on POD180. Immediately after islet transplantation, hyperglycemia was reversed with normalization of blood sugars from >250mg/dL (pre-transplant) to 80-110 mg/dL. Porcine islets functioned and maintained normal BG levels without any exogenous insulin treatment throughout the recipient's postoperative course. Post-mortem evaluation of liver confirmed presence of insulinstaining islets. \n\nDiscussion: timing of sequential transplants and immunomodulatory strategies may be important for success of islet-afterkidney xenotransplantation \n\nAs referenced above (see Preclinical progress in porcine islet xenotransplantation), investigators have recently achieved cure of diabetes in baboons using pooled islets from neonatal genetically modified pig donors (46). However, this required an average of 14 neonatal pancreases (70 piglets for 5 baboon recipients). In our model, we have achieved normoglycemia using islets derived from a single source adult pig with an administered islet mass of 12,500 IEQ/ kg. Of note, this is within range though slightly less than was required in the recent clinical islet-after-kidney transplantation studies where successful islet transplants averaged >16,000 IEQ/kg (2). \n\nOne reason for the success of free islet transplantation in this model may be timing of sequential transplants: kidney-first transplantation promotes absorption of anti-pig antibodies, likely reducing IBMIR following islet transplantation, corresponding to reduced loss of islets. This may have enabled durable reversal of diabetes with fewer islet equivalents as compared with clinical isletafter-kidney transplantation. Indeed, the possible antibody absorption benefits of sequential transplant timing is less clear in the clinical islet-after-kidney studies, where islet transplantation occurred well after index kidney transplantation.",

Negative controls were present in previous studies of composite IK technologiesin pig-to-pig, baboon-tobaboon, and macaque-to-macaque modelsand demonstrated preservation of islets with composite I-K transplantation across allogeneic barriers. In the past year, due to lack of inbred or cloned source pigs, we tested an alternative strategy for combined islet and kidney transplantation across a xenogeneic barrier that would also serve as a control of the composite I-K strategy. This alternative approach involves delayed islet transplantation after kidney and vascularized thymus transplantation (role of vascularized thymus transplantation in the induction of tolerance across xenogeneic barriers reviewed in (28)), using a recipient size-matched kidney and thymus source pig, as well as a large source pig for islets. Notably this approach (without thymus co-transplantation) is also similar to recent work in human islet-after-kidney transplantation conducted by the CIT consortium. Although additional cases are required, we have achieved reversal of diabetes and life-supporting renal function for 180 days with this kidney-first sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation (52). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of maintenance of durable normoglycemia and stable creatinine with porcine kidney and islets in a diabetic and life-supporting pig-to-baboon combined kidney, vascularized thymus and islet xenotransplantation model.

Patients with diabetic nephropathy represent a uniqueand growingpopulation that would benefit from both islet and kidney transplantation. Indeed, the favorable riskto-benefit considerations of combined islet and kidney transplantation in this population inspired recent promising clinical studies in islet after kidney transplantation led by the Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) Consortium (2). However, at present these procedures are rare, due, in part, to a shortage of deceased donor organs (3). Xenotransplantation using organs derived from pigs may overcome this organ shortage and allow for broader application of combined islet and kidney transplantation. \n\nThe past several years have seen enormous progress in the field of xenotransplantation, with advances in gene-editing and immunosuppression leading to long-term survivals of both kidney and heart xenografts in pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) studies (4-7), as well as early studies (preclinical and clinical) in humans (8)(9)(10). Clinical translation of porcine islet transplantation predated these recent successes in solid organ xenotransplantation, with encouraging pig-to-NHP studies leading to several small clinical studies using porcine islets in humans (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21).

Eisenson, Hayato Iwase, Weili Chen, Yu Hisadome, Wanxing Cui, Michelle R Santillan, Alexander C. Schulick, Du Gu, Amanda Maxwell, Kristy Koenig, Zhaoli Sun, Daniel Warren, Kazuhiko Yamada\n## Abstract\nCombined islet and kidney xenotransplantation for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy represents a compelling and increasingly relevant therapeutic possibility for an ever-growing number of patients who would benefit from both durable renal replacement and cure of the underlying cause of their renal insufficiency: diabetes. Here we briefly review immune barriers to islet transplantation, highlight preclinical progress in the field, and summarize our experience with combined islet and kidney xenotransplantation, including both challenges with islet-kidney composite grafts as well as our recent success with sequential kidney followed by islet xenotransplantation in a pig-to-baboon model.\n## Introduction\nDiabetes is a leading cause of both cardiovascular disease and end stage renal disease (ESRD), and incidence is increasing across the country and across the globe (1). Human islet transplantation is an effective treatment for diabetic patients but requires lifelong immunosuppression: prospective islet transplant recipients must weigh the risks of immunosuppression against the short-and longterm complications of diabetes. Patients with diabetic nephropathy represent a uniqueand growingpopulation that would benefit from both islet and kidney transplantation. Indeed, the favorable riskto-benefit considerations of combined islet and kidney transplantation in this population inspired recent promising clinical studies in islet after kidney transplantation led by the Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) Consortium (2). However, at present these procedures are rare, due, in part, to a shortage of deceased donor organs (3). Xenotransplantation using organs derived from pigs may overcome this organ shortage and allow for broader application of combined islet and kidney transplantation. \n\nThe past several years have seen enormous progress in the field of xenotransplantation, with advances in gene-editing and immunosuppression leading to long-term survivals of both kidney and heart xenografts in pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) studies (4-7), as well as early studies (preclinical and clinical) in humans (8)(9)(10). Clinical translation of porcine islet transplantation predated these recent successes in solid organ xenotransplantation, with encouraging pig-to-NHP studies leading to several small clinical studies using porcine islets in humans (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21). However, results of these early studies in clinical islet xenotransplantation have been mixed.\n\n## Preclinical progress in porcine islet xenotransplantation: encapsulation and source pig genetic modifications\nIn solid organ xenotransplantation, preformed antibody binding leads to hyperacute rejection of graft; in free islet xenotransplantation, preformed antibody binding leads to an amplified IBMIR with islet loss (40). While elimination of targets of preformed Nabs (particularly elimination of a-gal with creation of a-1,3 Galactosyl transferase gene knockout or GalTKO source pigs) has been essential for successful pig-to-NHP heart and kidney xenotransplantation (4,41,42), the impact of using GalTKO source pigs on xenograft survival in islet transplantation is less conclusive, which may be a function of changes in a-gal expression with islet maturation (43)(44)(45). Similarly, correcting for species incompatibilities between porcine and primate complement regulatory systems through individual insertion of human complement regulatory proteins may not significantly reduce the incidence of IBMIR (44). However, combining carbohydrate antigen gene knockouts with complement regulatory transgenes proves additive: xenogeneic islets from GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 and GalTKO.hCD39.hCD46 source pigs demonstrated reduced islet loss and attenuated IBMIR (15, 16). More recently, islets derived from neonatal GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 source pigs demonstrated cure of diabetes with >1 year of insulin independence in the stringent pigto-baboon model (46).\n\n## Combined kidney and islet xenotransplantation to broaden clinical applicability of porcine islet xenotransplantation\nMarked improvements in diabetes management and emerging therapies have changed the risk-benefit calculus associated with islet transplantation more broadly, and porcine islet xenotransplantation in particular. As described in the preceding section, encapsulation technologieswhich may allow for durable glucose control without immunosuppressionremain one relevant application for porcine islet xenotransplantation. Another relevant strategy is combining porcine islet xenotransplantation with solid organ xenotransplantation. This strategy has already been employed with success by the CIT consortium treating diabetic nephropathy with islet transplantation after kidney transplantation, but broader application is limited by the shortage of deceased donor organs. The following sections detail our preclinical experience with combined islet and kidney transplantation, including both composite islet-kidney transplantation as well as kidney-first sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation.\n\n## Combined islet and kidney xenotransplantation: recent success with sequential kidney followed by islet xenotransplantation\nDefinitive evaluation of composite I-K transplantation in a pigto-NHP model also requires a control: independent kidney and free islet transplantation. Negative controls were present in previous studies of composite IK technologiesin pig-to-pig, baboon-tobaboon, and macaque-to-macaque modelsand demonstrated preservation of islets with composite I-K transplantation across allogeneic barriers. In the past year, due to lack of inbred or cloned source pigs, we tested an alternative strategy for combined islet and kidney transplantation across a xenogeneic barrier that would also serve as a control of the composite I-K strategy. This alternative approach involves delayed islet transplantation after kidney and vascularized thymus transplantation (role of vascularized thymus transplantation in the induction of tolerance across xenogeneic barriers reviewed in (28)), using a recipient size-matched kidney and thymus source pig, as well as a large source pig for islets. Notably this approach (without thymus co-transplantation) is also similar to recent work in human islet-after-kidney transplantation conducted by the CIT consortium. Although additional cases are required, we have achieved reversal of diabetes and life-supporting renal function for 180 days with this kidney-first sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation (52). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of maintenance of durable normoglycemia and stable creatinine with porcine kidney and islets in a diabetic and life-supporting pig-to-baboon combined kidney, vascularized thymus and islet xenotransplantation model. These preliminary results were recently presented at the International Xenotransplantation Association Congress (San Diego, 2023), and are described in detail in the following sections:\n\n## Results: islet-after-kidney pig-to-baboon xenotransplantation cures diabetes and renal insufficiency\nBoth renal insufficiency and diabetes were cured with kidneyfirst sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation. The baboon recipient maintained normal serum creatinine with no evidence of rejection for six months following kidney and islet transplant but was euthanized due to sepsis related to pyelonephritis in setting of stent occlusion on POD180. Immediately after islet transplantation, hyperglycemia was reversed with normalization of blood sugars from >250mg/dL (pre-transplant) to 80-110 mg/dL. Porcine islets functioned and maintained normal BG levels without any exogenous insulin treatment throughout the recipient's postoperative course. Post-mortem evaluation of liver confirmed presence of insulinstaining islets. \n\nDiscussion: timing of sequential transplants and immunomodulatory strategies may be important for success of islet-afterkidney xenotransplantation \n\nAs referenced above (see Preclinical progress in porcine islet xenotransplantation), investigators have recently achieved cure of diabetes in baboons using pooled islets from neonatal genetically modified pig donors (46). However, this required an average of 14 neonatal pancreases (70 piglets for 5 baboon recipients). In our model, we have achieved normoglycemia using islets derived from a single source adult pig with an administered islet mass of 12,500 IEQ/ kg. Of note, this is within range though slightly less than was required in the recent clinical islet-after-kidney transplantation studies where successful islet transplants averaged >16,000 IEQ/kg (2). \n\nOne reason for the success of free islet transplantation in this model may be timing of sequential transplants: kidney-first transplantation promotes absorption of anti-pig antibodies, likely reducing IBMIR following islet transplantation, corresponding to reduced loss of islets. This may have enabled durable reversal of diabetes with fewer islet equivalents as compared with clinical isletafter-kidney transplantation. Indeed, the possible antibody absorption benefits of sequential transplant timing is less clear in the clinical islet-after-kidney studies, where islet transplantation occurred well after index kidney transplantation.\n\n## Porcine islet xenotransplantation: the best path forward may be dual indication transplantation\nPorcine islet xenotransplantation is one promising strategy for cure of diabetes among an evolving landscape of emerging therapies in diabetes management. While islet-alone xenotransplantation strategies continue to show improvement with source pig genetic modifications and refinements to immunosuppression regimens, approaches like encapsulation which allow for reversal of diabetes without immunosuppression may be more clinically relevant. Porcine islet xenotransplantation, in conjunction with kidney xenotransplantation, remains a particularly compelling therapeutic possibility for patients with diabetic nephropathy who require both kidney and islet replacement, and who have already committed to immunosuppression for their kidney grafts. Composite islet-kidney transplantation has proven challenging in xenogeneic preclinical models; however, preliminary studies in islet-after-kidney xenotransplantation are promising and may point to a path forward with combined islet and kidney transplantation for diabetic nephropathy.",

In the last decade, several groups from around the world have shown success in restoring insulin independence for a period > 6 mo in diabetic nonhuman primate recipients of pig islets, a breakthrough achievement in xenotransplantation [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] .

Many tissues (e.g., cardiac valves) are already broadly utilized with human patients [20] . While non-vascularized or decellularized tissues such as the valves are easier to implant than organs or islets, as they do not entail the complexity of dealing with xenorejection, the willingness of the public to accept porcine cardiac valves helps lay the groundwork for acceptance of additional medical uses for the pig. \n\nPractical considerations also make the pig a likely candidate for medical use. While nonhuman primates are the closest animals to humans from an evolutionary standpoint and, therefore, would be immunologically and physiologically more adaptive to human needs, their use in clinical xenotransplantation would not likely be accepted. Apes are endangered species, thus raising ethical concerns. They have litters of one or two offspring (like humans) and their growth requires years to reach full size, making it difficult to achieve a sufficient number of potential donors to satisfy demand.",

While nonhuman primates are the closest animals to humans from an evolutionary standpoint and, therefore, would be immunologically and physiologically more adaptive to human needs, their use in clinical xenotransplantation would not likely be accepted. Apes are endangered species, thus raising ethical concerns. They have litters of one or two offspring (like humans) and their growth requires years to reach full size, making it difficult to achieve a sufficient number of potential donors to satisfy demand.",

Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (110), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (113). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (114). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (115). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (116) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (117,118) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment. However, translating these experimental successes to a clinical setting remains a major challenge. The first ever human islet xenotransplantation of 10 patients with fetal porcine islets was performed by Growth et al. in 1994 (119). They demonstrated that xenografts can survive for up to serval months, but patients failed to show any improvements in their glycemic control (119). Since then, investigators have made procedural adjustments including genetic modifications, islet encapsulation, and isolation modifications in an attempt to improve the clinical success of xenotransplantation. In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120).",

Asari, Y. Nanno, Hiroyuki Nakamura, Taisuke Okawa, Takumi Fukumoto\n## Abstract\nAllogeneic islet transplantation becomes a viable option for patients with unstable type 1 diabetes. However, considering the huge number of patients with type 1 diabetes, human donor shortage is a serious issue. To overcome the donor shortage issue, xenotransplantation is an attractive option. In fact, clinical islet xenotransplantation has been conducted since 1990s. The first clinical trial was performed using fetal pigs and demonstrated the porcine pancreatic tissue could survive in human body with immunosuppressive strategies. To scale up the islet production, Canadian group established a method for islet isolation from neonatal pigs. Their method has been used for clinical islet xenotransplantation in New Zealand, Russian, Mexico, Argentina, and China. Recently Korean group published a clinical protocol for islet xenotransplantation using adult pigs. For the next generation of islet xenotransplantation, gene-modified pigs were created. Especially \u201csuperislets\u201d created by Belgian group demonstrated promising preclinical outcomes. With advanced donor pigs, islet xenotransplantation might become a suitable treatment for the majority of type 1 diabetic patients.

In the present study, we generated immunocompromised type 1 diabetic G\u00f6ttingen mini-pig models and demonstrated the engraftment of human-induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived pancreatic islet cells (iPICs). We induced hyperglycemia with a concomitant reduction in endogenous C-peptide levels in pigs that underwent thymectomy and splenectomy. After estimating the effective in vivo dose of immunosuppressants (ISs) via in vitro testing, we conducted exploratory implantation of iPICs using various implantation methods under IS treatments in one pig. Five weeks after implantation, histological analysis of the implanted iPICs embedded in fibrin gel revealed numerous islet-like structures with insulin-positive cells. Moreover, the area of the insulin-positive cells in the pre-peritoneally implanted grafts was greater than in the subcutaneously implanted grafts. Immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that these iPIC grafts contained cells positive for glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptides, similar to naturally occurring islets. The engraftment of iPICs was successfully reproduced. These data support the observation that the iPICs engrafted well, particularly in the pre-peritoneal space of the newly generated immunocompromised diabetic mini-pigs, forming islet-like endocrine clusters. Future evaluation of human cells in this immunocompromised pig model could accelerate and development of cell therapy products. Graphical Abstract",

Approximately 3.3% to 13.5% of patients with T1DM experience unstable blood glucose regulation and recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms despite appropriate insulin therapy 1,2 . For these patients, pancreas/islet transplantation is a promising therapeutic option; however, it is hampered by the shortage and non-uniform quality of cells in clinical settings 3 . In this context, stem cell-derived islets have gained attention as an alternative cell source owing to the feasibility of largescale cell manufacturing with uniform quality 4,5 . \n\nT1DM rodent models are often used to assess the engraftment and functioning of human primary and stem cellderived islets. However, humans and rodents exhibit significant differences in terms of anatomy, body size, and blood volume. These variations may lead to translational challenges; thus, the use of animal models closer in size to humans is preferable to obtain translatable results for clinical applications. Among the many experimental animals, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs), and pigs 6,7 are commonly used. In addition, mini-pig skin resembles human skin in multiple aspects such as cell components and the thickness of individual skin layers 8,9 . In fact, pigs have been used to evaluate subcutaneously implanted human-sized surgical devices 10 , as well as insulin pumps, whose catheters are inserted into the subcutaneous space 11 . Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models 12 . Itoh et al. 12 recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

Mochida, Teruki Hamada, Saori Watanabe-Matsumoto, Shuhei Konagaya, Manami Kaneko, Ryo Ito, Hikaru Ueno, Taro Toyoda\n## Abstract\nIn the development of cell therapy products, immunocompromised animal models closer in size to humans are valuable for enhancing the translatability of in vivo findings to clinical trials. In the present study, we generated immunocompromised type 1 diabetic G\u00f6ttingen mini-pig models and demonstrated the engraftment of human-induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived pancreatic islet cells (iPICs). We induced hyperglycemia with a concomitant reduction in endogenous C-peptide levels in pigs that underwent thymectomy and splenectomy. After estimating the effective in vivo dose of immunosuppressants (ISs) via in vitro testing, we conducted exploratory implantation of iPICs using various implantation methods under IS treatments in one pig. Five weeks after implantation, histological analysis of the implanted iPICs embedded in fibrin gel revealed numerous islet-like structures with insulin-positive cells. Moreover, the area of the insulin-positive cells in the pre-peritoneally implanted grafts was greater than in the subcutaneously implanted grafts. Immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that these iPIC grafts contained cells positive for glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptides, similar to naturally occurring islets. The engraftment of iPICs was successfully reproduced. These data support the observation that the iPICs engrafted well, particularly in the pre-peritoneal space of the newly generated immunocompromised diabetic mini-pigs, forming islet-like endocrine clusters. Future evaluation of human cells in this immunocompromised pig model could accelerate and development of cell therapy products. Graphical Abstract\n## Introduction\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the destruction of insulin-releasing \u03b2-cells in the pancreatic islets. Approximately 3.3% to 13.5% of patients with T1DM experience unstable blood glucose regulation and recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms despite appropriate insulin therapy 1,2 . For these patients, pancreas/islet transplantation is a promising therapeutic option; however, it is hampered by the shortage and non-uniform quality of cells in clinical settings 3 . In this context, stem cell-derived islets have gained attention as an alternative cell source owing to the feasibility of largescale cell manufacturing with uniform quality 4,5 . \n\nT1DM rodent models are often used to assess the engraftment and functioning of human primary and stem cellderived islets. However, humans and rodents exhibit significant differences in terms of anatomy, body size, and blood volume. These variations may lead to translational challenges; thus, the use of animal models closer in size to humans is preferable to obtain translatable results for clinical applications. Among the many experimental animals, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs), and pigs 6,7 are commonly used. In addition, mini-pig skin resembles human skin in multiple aspects such as cell components and the thickness of individual skin layers 8,9 . In fact, pigs have been used to evaluate subcutaneously implanted human-sized surgical devices 10 , as well as insulin pumps, whose catheters are inserted into the subcutaneous space 11 . Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models 12 . Itoh et al. 12 recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

Islet transplantation into the portal vein is the current clinical practice. This method can induce the dysfunction in islet engraftment and survival owing to low oxygen tension, an active innate immune system, and the provocation of an inflammatory response, eventually resulting in the loss of many transplanted islets. Thus, subcutaneous transplantation has been recommended as an alternative choice (van der Windt et al., 2008). \n\nAdult and neonatal pig islets xeno-transplanted in immunosuppressive nonhuman primates survived for more than 6 months (Cardona et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006). These reports are encouraging since porcine pancreatic xenograft can survive longer than other xenograft organs, suggesting the crucial clue in xenotransplantation. Several investigators alleged that xenotransplantaion of pig pancreatic primoria may be a candidate model as a therapeutics for both types 1 and 2 diabetes (Thomas et al., 1995;Rogers et al., 2006).

Park\n## Abstract\nXenotransplantation is a hot topic currently, since the demand for diverse organs is increasing in patients. Among many species, pigs are suitable animals for xenotranplantation as they share many anatomical and physiological characteristics with humans. This review article provides an overview of porcine xenotransplantation and the rejection of pig xenotransplants in primates, and use of genetically modified and cloned pigs in xenotransplantation. It also highlights major target organs in porcine xenotransplantation and virus infection in xenotransplantation.\n## Pancreatic islet xenotransplantation\nHigh yields of pure and viable porcine islet cells to be used for microencapsulation are crucial for successful xenotransplantation and the reduction of the damage in porcine islet isolation should be considered (Stiegler et al., 2010). Islet transplantation into the portal vein is the current clinical practice. This method can induce the dysfunction in islet engraftment and survival owing to low oxygen tension, an active innate immune system, and the provocation of an inflammatory response, eventually resulting in the loss of many transplanted islets. Thus, subcutaneous transplantation has been recommended as an alternative choice (van der Windt et al., 2008). \n\nAdult and neonatal pig islets xeno-transplanted in immunosuppressive nonhuman primates survived for more than 6 months (Cardona et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006). These reports are encouraging since porcine pancreatic xenograft can survive longer than other xenograft organs, suggesting the crucial clue in xenotransplantation. Several investigators alleged that xenotransplantaion of pig pancreatic primoria may be a candidate model as a therapeutics for both types 1 and 2 diabetes (Thomas et al., 1995;Rogers et al., 2006). Rogers et al. (2007) demonstrated that transplantation of embryonic day (E) 28 (E28) pig pancreatic primordia into the mesentery of STZdiabetic rhesus macaques reduced insulin requirement, suggesting the availability for diabetes. Although the report of porcine pancreatic islets xenograft into non-human primates was restricted to type I diabetes (van der Windt et al., 2009;Cooper and Casu, 2009), the usefulness in type II diabetes also remains to be attempted. Komoda et al. (2005) have demonstrated that islets from transgenic pigs expressing N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III showed prolonged survival after transplantation into cynomolgus monkeys.",

In addition, transplantation of galactosyl knock-out neonate pig islets was found to significantly enhance normoglycemia rates in diabetic primates, likely due to the decreased susceptibility of these xenografts to innate immunity mediated by complement and preformed xenoantibodies [33] . These results, however, required treatment with a heavy immunosuppressive regimen, in particular an anti-CD154-specific mAb, an antibody that induced thromboembolic events precluding its clinical use [34] . Despite the unacceptability of these immunosuppressive regimens in humans, these results are very encouraging since an alternative, nontoxic regimen combined with xenotransplantation of pig islets may induce normoglycemia in diabetic patients. \n\nA bioartificial pancreas, in which islets of Langerhans are encapsulated within a semipermeable membrane, may be an alternative therapeutic device for patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. It may constitute a safe and simple method of transplanting islets without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Since the semipermeable membrane protects the islets from the host immune system, the islets are likely to survive and release insulin for a long period of time, thereby controlling glucose metabolism in the absence of immunosuppressive medication. Nevertheless, several important questions are associated with the transplanta-Dufrane D et al .

Despite the unacceptability of these immunosuppressive regimens in humans, these results are very encouraging since an alternative, nontoxic regimen combined with xenotransplantation of pig islets may induce normoglycemia in diabetic patients. \n\nA bioartificial pancreas, in which islets of Langerhans are encapsulated within a semipermeable membrane, may be an alternative therapeutic device for patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. It may constitute a safe and simple method of transplanting islets without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Since the semipermeable membrane protects the islets from the host immune system, the islets are likely to survive and release insulin for a long period of time, thereby controlling glucose metabolism in the absence of immunosuppressive medication. Nevertheless, several important questions are associated with the transplanta-Dufrane D et al . Encapsulated islets for type 1 diabetes tion of immunoisolated adult pig islets as a \"bioartificial pancreas\" [35] (Table 1).",

Citro, Valentina Tomajer, S. Partelli, R. Caldara\n## Abstract\nThis opinion paper evaluates the potential of porcine islets as a promising alternative in beta cell replacement therapy for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), juxtaposed with the current limitations of human donor islets. It analyzes the compatibility of pig islets with human glucose metabolism, their prospects as a limitless and high-quality source of beta cells, and the unique immunogenic challenges they present in xenotransplantation. Additionally, the paper discusses the regulatory and ethical considerations pertinent to the use of porcine islets. By synthesizing current research and expert perspectives, the paper highlights both the opportunities and significant barriers that need addressing to advance pig islets as a viable therapeutic option. The findings advocate for a balanced and forward-looking approach to the integration of pig islets in T1D treatment, underscoring the need for continued research and dialogue in this evolving field.\n",

Further research into the optimal timeline for islet isolation is being conducted in DPF pigs generated at our research center.",

Graft loss after transplant however continues to hinder the long-term success of the procedure. Transplanting the islets as a pre-vascularized composite islet-kidney graft has emerged as a relevant solution. Much groundbreaking research has been done utilizing this model in conjunction with strategies aimed towards islet cell survival and prolongation of function in the host. Transplanting the islet cells as a prevascularized graft under the capsule of the donor kidney as a composite islet-kidney graft has been shown to provide long term durable blood glucose control in large animal studies by limiting graft apoptosis as well as providing a physical barrier against the host immune response. While promising, this technique is limited by long term immunosuppression requirements of the host with its well-known adverse sequelae. Research into tolerance inducing strategies of the host to the allogeneic and xenogeneic islet-kidney graft has shown much promise in the avoidance of long-term immunosuppression. In addition, utilizing xenogeneic tissue grafts could provide a near-limitless supply of organs. The islet-kidney model could provide a durable and long-term cure for diabetes. Here we summarize the most recent data, as well as groundbreaking strategies to avoid long term immunosuppression and promote graft acceptance.",

Use of a xenogeneic (e.g., pig) donor for the composite I-K transplant would allow for preparation of composite I-K's in living donors, as well as eliminating the risk of not obtaining the sufficient islet volume required to correct diabetes in recipients without inducing diabetes in the donors. Xenogeneic tissue grafts of course would provide a near-limitless supply of tissues and organs for this purpose. \n\nSwine would make an ideal candidate for donor tissues to be used in human xenotransplantation (63,64). It would of course have been unreasonable to attempt xenogeneic I-K transplantation until the success of xenogeneic renal transplantation reached a stage where survivals would justify extending the procedure to a composite organ in preclinical pig-to-non-human primate models. Recently, however, investigators both in our center (65) and elsewhere (66,67) have reported renal xenograft survivals of well over 6 months in pig-to-nonhuman primate models. In contrast to renal xenografts maintained with chronic immunosuppression which have eventually progressed to organ loss due to chronic rejection, we have achieved longer than 6 months survival of life-supporting pig kidneys utilizing the tolerance-inducing approach of vascularized thymic grafts (65) (Yamada K. et al. manuscript in preparation) in multiple baboon recipients. These animals were pig specific unresponsive and developed new T cells from the pig thymic grafts. Unfortunately, due to the size disparity between the two species the recipients were ultimately euthanized due to the development of cortical ischemia in the grafts and compartment syndrome in the small baboons caused by the growth of the pig life-supporting kidneys. Even though humans are much larger than the small baboons used in the study, and in theory should not have the same issue, the problems caused by organ growth should be addressed in future studies.",

Free (nonencapsulated) pig islets (either wildtype or genetically-engineered) have maintained normoglycemia in immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for N1 year (Park et al., 2015). Immunoisolated (encapsulated) pig islets have maintained normoglycemia in non-immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for up to 6 months (Dufrane et al., 2006). \n\nGroth et al. performed the first clinical islet xenotransplantation in 1994 using fetal porcine islet-like cell clusters placed under the kidney capsule (Groth et al., 1994). Although clinical benefit was not demonstrated, evidence was provided by measurement of porcine C-peptide that porcine islets could survive in the human body. The first nationally-regulated clinical trial of intra-peritoneal alginate-poly-L-ornithinealginate (APA) encapsulated (neonatal) porcine islet xenotransplantation in nonimmunosuppressed diabetic patients was carried out in New Zealand and was associated with some reduction in hypoglycemic unawareness (Matsumoto et al., 2014).

Cooper\n## Abstract\nNone\n## body\nWith the encouraging results of pancreatic islet allotransplantation, increasing attention is being directed towards pig islet xenotransplantation, which would resolve the problem of islet supply (Markmann et al., 2016;Ekser et al., 2012). Free (nonencapsulated) pig islets (either wildtype or genetically-engineered) have maintained normoglycemia in immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for N1 year (Park et al., 2015). Immunoisolated (encapsulated) pig islets have maintained normoglycemia in non-immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for up to 6 months (Dufrane et al., 2006). \n\nGroth et al. performed the first clinical islet xenotransplantation in 1994 using fetal porcine islet-like cell clusters placed under the kidney capsule (Groth et al., 1994). Although clinical benefit was not demonstrated, evidence was provided by measurement of porcine C-peptide that porcine islets could survive in the human body. The first nationally-regulated clinical trial of intra-peritoneal alginate-poly-L-ornithinealginate (APA) encapsulated (neonatal) porcine islet xenotransplantation in nonimmunosuppressed diabetic patients was carried out in New Zealand and was associated with some reduction in hypoglycemic unawareness (Matsumoto et al., 2014). However, there was a lack of correlation between the number of islets transplanted and the clinical outcome; the transplantation of 5000 IEq/kg was associated with better results than of 15,000 or 20,000 IEq/kg. \n\nIn this issue of EBioMedicine, Matsumoto et al. report the second clinical trial of nationally-regulated encapsulated porcine islet xenotransplantation, conducted in Argentina (Matsumoto et al., 2016). From their previous experience, the authors speculated that a large islet mass was susceptible to injury from oxygen and/or nutrient insufficiency, resulting in cell death.",

While pancreas transplantation remains the gold standard for patients who have difficulty controlling their symptoms with exogenous insulin, islet allotransplantation is now able to provide similar results with some advantages that make it an attractive potential alternative. The Edmonton Protocol, which incorporated a large dose of islets from multiple donors with steroid-free immunosuppression helped to establish the modern era of islet transplantation almost 20 years ago. While islet allotransplantation is recognized around the world as a powerful clinical therapy for type 1 diabetes it is not yet recognized by the Federal Drug Administration of the United States. Large-scale clinical trials administered by the Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium have recently demonstrated that the well-regulated manufacture of a human islet product transplanted into patients with difficult to control type 1 diabetes and with a history of severe hyperglycemic episodes can safely and efficaciously maintain glycemic balance and eliminate the most severe complications associated with diabetes. The results of these clinical trials have established a strong basis for licensure of clinical islet allotransplantation in the US. Recognition by the Federal Drug Administration would likely lead to third party reimbursement for islet allotransplantation as a therapeutic option in the United States and would make the treatment available to many more patients. The high costs of rampant diabetes justify the expense of the treatment, which is in-line with the costs of clinical pancreas transplantation. While much enthusiasm and hope is raised toward the development and optimization of stem cell therapy, the islet transplantation community should push toward licensure, if that means broader access of this procedure to patients who may benefit from it. Even as we prepare to take the first steps in that direction, we must acknowledge the new challenges that a shift from the experimental to clinical will bring. Clinical islet allotransplantation in the United States would be a game-changing event in the treatment of type 1 diabetes and also generate enthusiasm for continued research.",

Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (68). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (69,70). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (71). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46).",

Trucco\n## Abstract\nMilestones in the history of diabetes therapy include the discovery of insulin and successful methods of beta cell replacement including whole pancreas and islet cell transplantation options. While pancreas transplantation remains the gold standard for patients who have difficulty controlling their symptoms with exogenous insulin, islet allotransplantation is now able to provide similar results with some advantages that make it an attractive potential alternative. The Edmonton Protocol, which incorporated a large dose of islets from multiple donors with steroid-free immunosuppression helped to establish the modern era of islet transplantation almost 20 years ago. While islet allotransplantation is recognized around the world as a powerful clinical therapy for type 1 diabetes it is not yet recognized by the Federal Drug Administration of the United States. Large-scale clinical trials administered by the Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium have recently demonstrated that the well-regulated manufacture of a human islet product transplanted into patients with difficult to control type 1 diabetes and with a history of severe hyperglycemic episodes can safely and efficaciously maintain glycemic balance and eliminate the most severe complications associated with diabetes. The results of these clinical trials have established a strong basis for licensure of clinical islet allotransplantation in the US. Recognition by the Federal Drug Administration would likely lead to third party reimbursement for islet allotransplantation as a therapeutic option in the United States and would make the treatment available to many more patients. The high costs of rampant diabetes justify the expense of the treatment, which is in-line with the costs of clinical pancreas transplantation. While much enthusiasm and hope is raised toward the development and optimization of stem cell therapy, the islet transplantation community should push toward licensure, if that means broader access of this procedure to patients who may benefit from it. Even as we prepare to take the first steps in that direction, we must acknowledge the new challenges that a shift from the experimental to clinical will bring. Clinical islet allotransplantation in the United States would be a game-changing event in the treatment of type 1 diabetes and also generate enthusiasm for continued research.\n## EXTENDING THE REACH OF ISLET TRANSPLANTATION\nTable 1 reports a list of sites used in clinical islet transplantation. \n\nFurther on the frontiers of medicine are alternative methods to produce islets without relying on human organ donors, including techniques for the xenotransplantation of porcine islets. Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (68). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (69,70). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (71). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46).",

These results encourage the use of iPSCs-derived blike cells in future diabetes treatment. Further research should be followed to prove their benefits in clinical application. \n\nXenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted 21 . In addition, PERV, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and other microorganisms are potential sources of zoonosis that should be considered as well. Recently, a genetically engineered porcine heart was transplanted to a 57 year old man. The recipient survived 2 months after surgery and the medical team recently reported that the patient had been infected with porcine cytomegalovirus 22 . Thus, zoonosis is still an important issue in xenotransplantation. For this reason, the current International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) guideline recommends the use of PERV-C negative pigs nurtured at a designated pathogen-free facility 23 .

Yoon\n## Abstract\nIslet transplantation is an important option in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, a donor shortage and immunosuppressant\u2010related complications are the current major hurdles of islet transplantation. In this review, we discuss recent updates on islet transplantation to overcome these current obstacles and we share our perspectives on future \u03b2 cell replacement therapy.\n## body\nRecently, Hogrebe et al. 20 introduced a highly efficient iPSC differentiation protocol by targeting the cytoskeleton with latrunculin A (29.1% of NKX6.1 + Cpeptide + ). These results encourage the use of iPSCs-derived blike cells in future diabetes treatment. Further research should be followed to prove their benefits in clinical application. \n\nXenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted 21 . In addition, PERV, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and other microorganisms are potential sources of zoonosis that should be considered as well. Recently, a genetically engineered porcine heart was transplanted to a 57 year old man. The recipient survived 2 months after surgery and the medical team recently reported that the patient had been infected with porcine cytomegalovirus 22 . Thus, zoonosis is still an important issue in xenotransplantation. For this reason, the current International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) guideline recommends the use of PERV-C negative pigs nurtured at a designated pathogen-free facility 23 . In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24 .",

The restoration of normoglycemia and insulin independence in immunosuppressed type 1 diabetic recipients of islet allotransplantation has shown the potential of a cell-based diabetes therapy. Even if successful, this approach poses a problem of scarce tissue supply. Xenotransplantation can be the answer to this limited donor availability and, among possible candidate tissues for xenotransplantation, porcine islets are the closest to a future clinical application. Xenotransplantation, with pigs as donors, offers the possibility of using healthy, living, and genetically modified islets from pathogen-free animals available in unlimited number of islets. Several studies in the pig-to-nonhuman primate model demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical islet xenotransplantation and have provided insights into the critical events and possible mechanisms of immune recognition and rejection of xenogeneic islet grafts. Particularly promising results in the achievement of prolonged insulin independence were obtained with newly developed, genetically modified pigs islets able to produce immunoregulatory products, using different implantation sites, and new immunotherapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to generate additional safety and efficacy data in nonhuman primate models to safely translate these findings into the clinic.",

Data sources Data used in this review were mainly from English literature of Pubmed database. The search terms were \u201cpig islet\u201d and \u201cxenotransplantation\u201d. Study selection The original articles and critical reviews selected were relevant to this review's theme. Results Pigs are suggested to be an ideal candidate for obtaining available islet cells for transplantation. However, the potential clinical application of pig islet is still facing challenges including inadequate yield of high\u2010quality functional islets and xenorejection of the transplants. The former can be overcome mainly by selection of a suitable pathogen\u2010free source herd and the development of isolation and purification technology. While the feasibility of successful preclinical pig islet xenotranplantation provides insights in the possible mechanisms of xenogeneic immune recognition and rejection to overwhelm the latter. In addition, the achievement of long\u2010term insulin independence in diabetic models by means of distinct islet products and novel immunotherapeutic strategies is promising. Conclusions Pig islet xenotransplantation is one of the prospective treatments to bridge the gap between the needs of transplantation in patients with diabetes and available islet cells. Nonetheless, further studies and efforts are needed to translate obtained findings into tangible applications.",

While islet-alone xenotransplantation strategies continue to show improvement with source pig genetic modifications and refinements to immunosuppression regimens, approaches like encapsulation which allow for reversal of diabetes without immunosuppression may be more clinically relevant. Porcine islet xenotransplantation, in conjunction with kidney xenotransplantation, remains a particularly compelling therapeutic possibility for patients with diabetic nephropathy who require both kidney and islet replacement, and who have already committed to immunosuppression for their kidney grafts. Composite islet-kidney transplantation has proven challenging in xenogeneic preclinical models; however, preliminary studies in islet-after-kidney xenotransplantation are promising and may point to a path forward with combined islet and kidney transplantation for diabetic nephropathy.",

However, pancreatic islet transplantation has gradually showed satisfactory and prospective application in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (1). In the year 2000, Edmonton protocol (2) demonstrated that islet allotransplantation had achieved a remarkable success, but shortage of donors still prevented the progression of clinical islet transplantation. Xenotransplantation provides an effective and appropriate solution for this limitation. Among the potential candidates for islet xenotransplantation, pig is considered as the most ideal donor for future clinical applications (3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8). Although encouraging findings have been obtained in pig-to-primate islet xenotransplantation (9)(10)(11), the potential clinical application of pig islet still faces two major challenges: inadequate supply of islet cells with high-quality and xenorejection. This review will discuss the current approach and progress in pig donor selecting, isolation and preparation of pig-islet grafts, prevention of xenorejection, microbial safety, and obtained findings of clinical trials.",

Islet xenotransplantation, using pigs as a source of islets, is a promising approach to overcome this limitation. The greatest obstacle is the primate immune/inflammatory response to the porcine (pig) islets, which may take the form of rapid early graft rejection (the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction) or T-cell-mediated rejection. These problems are being resolved by the genetic engineering of the source pigs combined with improved immunosuppressive therapy. The results of pig-to-diabetic nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation are steadily improving, with insulin independence being achieved for periods >1 year. An alternative approach is to isolate islets within a micro- or macroencapsulation device aimed at protecting them from the human recipient's immune response. Clinical trials using this approach are currently underway. This review focuses on the major aspects of pig-to-primate islet xenotransplantation and its potential for treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

            "text": "Diabetes is a leading cause of both cardiovascular disease and end stage renal disease (ESRD), and incidence is increasing across the country and across the globe (1). Human islet transplantation is an effective treatment for diabetic patients but requires lifelong immunosuppression: prospective islet transplant recipients must weigh the risks of immunosuppression against the short-and longterm complications of diabetes. Patients with diabetic nephropathy represent a uniqueand growingpopulation that would benefit from both islet and kidney transplantation. Indeed, the favorable riskto-benefit considerations of combined islet and kidney transplantation in this population inspired recent promising clinical studies in islet after kidney transplantation led by the Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) Consortium (2). However, at present these procedures are rare, due, in part, to a shortage of deceased donor organs (3). Xenotransplantation using organs derived from pigs may overcome this organ shortage and allow for broader application of combined islet and kidney transplantation. \n\nThe past several years have seen enormous progress in the field of xenotransplantation, with advances in gene-editing and immunosuppression leading to long-term survivals of both kidney and heart xenografts in pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) studies (4-7), as well as early studies (preclinical and clinical) in humans (8)(9)(10). Clinical translation of porcine islet transplantation predated these recent successes in solid organ xenotransplantation, with encouraging pig-to-NHP studies leading to several small clinical studies using porcine islets in humans (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21).

            "text": "Clinical islet transplantation is limited by a relatively static supply of donor pancreases. Porcine islet xenotransplantation has long been proposed as a solution to this organ shortage, but enthusiasm for islet xenotransplantation waned in the face of mixed results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies. However, progress in the field of kidney and heart xenotransplantation with the development of rapid genome editing technologies, novel immunosuppression regimens, and even tolerance induction strategies has led to significant improvements in pig-to-NHP heart and kidney graft survival in recent years. As described in this review, these broader developments in xenotransplantation have contributed to specific improvements in pig-to-NHP islet xenograft transplantation, with recent studies demonstrating reversal of diabetes with costimulation-based immunosuppression protocols using islets obtained from multiply modified pigs (55).\n\nRecent pig-to-human heart and kidney xenograft transplants have recaptured the popular imagination. As the transplant community nears clinical trials in pig-to-human heart and kidney xenograft transplantation (https://www.wsj. com/articles/fda-said-to-plan-pig-organ-transplant-clinicaltrials-11656622411), there is renewed interest in clinical islet xenotransplantation. Given recent progress, there may be adequate pre-clinical efficacy and safety data to initiate select clinical trials within targeted patient populations, according to guidelines established by the International Xenotransplantation Association (11). The results of ongoing pre-clinical studies focusing on further genetic modifications of donor pigs, optimizing costimulation blockade without anti-CD154 mAb, and applying tolerance-inducing strategies to pre-clinical islet xenotransplantation will provide more clarity on the question of when islet xenotransplantation will become a viable clinical solution to diabetes.",

            "text": "The use of islets that originate from different species has been widely explored in order to circumvent the demand for human donors. Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (110), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (113). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (114). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (115). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (116) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (117,118) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment. However, translating these experimental successes to a clinical setting remains a major challenge. The first ever human islet xenotransplantation of 10 patients with fetal porcine islets was performed by Growth et al. in 1994 (119). They demonstrated that xenografts can survive for up to serval months, but patients failed to show any improvements in their glycemic control (119). Since then, investigators have made procedural adjustments including genetic modifications, islet encapsulation, and isolation modifications in an attempt to improve the clinical success of xenotransplantation. In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120).",

The incidence and prevalence of diabetes is predicted to increase. To alleviate this potentially severe situation, safer and more effective therapeutics are urgently required. Mice have long been the mainstay as preclinical models for basic research on diabetes, although they are not ideally suited for translating basic knowledge into clinical applications. To validate and optimize novel therapeutics for safe application in humans, an appropriate large animal model is needed. Large animals, especially pigs, are well suited for biomedical research and share many similarities with humans, including body size, anatomical features, physiology, and pathophysiology. Moreover, pigs already play an important role in translational studies, including clinical trials for xenotransplantation. Progress in genetic engineering over the past few decades has facilitated the development of transgenic animals, including porcine models of diabetes. This article discusses features that attest to the attractiveness of genetically modified porcine models of diabetes for testing novel treatment strategies using recent technical advances.",

            "text": "In the year 2000 the Edmonton protocol proved that clinical pancreatic islet allotransplantation (alloTx) can be successfully performed to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen [1]. Even if islet replacement could be considered a preferable alternative to insulin therapy in long-term diabetic patients, this therapeutic option will be practically limited by the number of islet donors that will never be sufficient. A possible solution to the problem of tissue supply may be found by investigating the potential of embryonic as well as induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functional insulinproducing cells. Clinical applications await successful testing in animal models. Alternatively, xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of pig islets is currently the most advanced and appealing approach with respect to a possible clinical application [2]. Pigs are the best candidates as human substitutes [3] for several reasons: pig insulin differs from human insulin by just one amino acid; pig islets have lower sensitivity to destruction by recurrent T1D autoimmunity than human islets [4], they do not accumulate amyloid [5], and pig donors can be genetically modified to improve immunomodulation and cytoprotection of pig islets. The experimental results of pig islets to non-human diabetic primates xenoTx are more encouraging than those obtained using pig whole organs, which makes their employment predictable in clinical trials in the next few years [6\u2022\u2022]. To make this technique a clinically feasible treatment option we need to generate more convincing preclinical data in the pig-to-primate xenoTx model.",

Paucity of human organ donors has led to the consideration of potential alternative sources of islet cells, with porcine islet cells being attractive candidates for cell therapy. Since porcine insulin has long been used and functions in humans to treat patients before recombinant human insulin became available due to high similarity in porcine insulin protein sequence with only one amino acid residue difference to human insulin, xenogeneic porcine islet cell therapy has long been proposed to treat T1D [26][27][28] . Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has been investigated as a potential bridge or the ultimate treatment for T1D in decades with substantial progresses in both preclinical and clinical studies. Xenogeneic islet cell therapy could become a clinically applicable treatment with proper clinically applicable immunosuppression regimens or efficient biocompatible matrix encapsulation devices that permit diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and prevent transplanted islet cells from the host immune attacks 26,27 . Preclinical pig-to-nonhuman primate transplantation models have been studied and the first long-term graft survival (>6 month) of pig islet cells in non-human primates (NHPs) has been demonstrated [29][30][31] . Subsequent study further confirmed reproducible curative potential in NHP model that pig islet grafts survived and maintained normoglycemia for >6 months with the longest up to 603 days 32 . The clinical studies with xenogeneic porcine islet cells demonstrated the cell survival and function in the human body with no noted serious adverse events, but these clinical islet cell xenotransplantation trials have not shown to durably prevent severe hypoglycemia while maintaining tight glycemic control in T1D patients 28,33 . \n\nXenogeneic hepatocytes for liver failures.",

            "text": "Nearly one in ten Americans suffers from diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, incidence is increasing in the United States and across the globe (1, 2). Diabetes is a leading cause of both cardiovascular disease and end stage renal disease (ESRD) (3,4), and carries particularly high short-term mortality in patients with hypoglycemic unawareness (5). Human islet transplantation has emerged as one effective treatment for diabetic patients with hypoglycemic unawareness (6), but this procedure is rare due, in part, to a shortage of deceased donor pancreases (7). Xenotransplantation using islets obtained from pigs may overcome this organ shortage and allow for broader application of islet transplantation.\n\n. /frtra. .\n\nThere have already been several small clinical studies using porcine islets in humans (8)(9)(10), but results have been mixed and further trials limited by more recent consensus guidelines calling for more rigorous pre-clinical data (11). However, recent studies in pig-to-human heart and kidney xenograft transplantation have reignited public enthusiasm for xenotransplantation and may reopen debate about when to initiate clinical trials in islet xenograft transplantation (12)(13)(14). This review describes the current status of xeno islet transplantation, outlining immunologic barriers to islet transplantation, current strategies to overcome these barriers including genetic modification and novel immunosuppression, and innovative strategies to induce tolerance in xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Diabetes causes several complications in patients, which burden health care systems. Allogeneic islet transplantation could improve physiological glucose metabolism [1]. However, the number of available human donor organs has not kept pace with the growing transplant candidate waiting lists, and a significant number of these patients die without receiving transplants [2]. This allotransplantation issue has stimulated research on the induction of insulin-producing cells and bioengineering. An alternate approach is the use of living cells, tissues, or organs from another species as donors. The concept of cross-species transplantation is known as xenotransplantation, and the transplanted cells, tissues, or organs are called xenografts. Xenotransplantation is an attractive option to overcome the issue of donor shortage [3,4]. \n\nPigs have been selected as the most suitable potential source of organs for xenotransplantation, because there are many similarities between humans and pigs, including similarities related to physiology and anatomy [5,6]. Additionally, porcine and human insulin differ by only one amino acid, and porcine insulin has been used for several decades in clinics. Pigs are widely available in many countries, are easily bred, and are known to have large litters. Additionally, ethical issues associated with the slaughter of nonhuman primates do not exist. Moreover, ethical and regulatory frameworks for islet xenotransplantation are present in several countries, and now, there is a greater awareness of the importance of developing an internationally harmonized ethical and regulatory framework [7]. Thus, pig-to-human xenotransplantation offers a potential bridge to the growing disparity between graft requirement among patients with diabetes and graft availability [3,4]. Indeed, islet transplantation from porcine pancreas was performed for the first time in the 1990s [8]. The International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) launched a consensus statement in 2009 on conditions for safely undertaking clinical trials of porcine islet products in patients with type 1 diabetes [9]. This statement covers the key aspects of ethical requirements. Recently, clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation was restarted under comprehensive regulations in New Zealand [10].",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a severe and debilitating chronic disease that develops in nearly 5% of the world's population [1,2].For all patients who have type 1 diabetes (insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells) or severe type 2 diabetes (impaired insulin secretion combined with reduced sensitivity to insulin), the only practical treatment possible today is lifelong insulin replacement by multiple daily injections.However, even for very compliant patients participating in a carefully titrated insulin therapy protocol aimed at avoiding glycemic fluctuations, it is difficult to tightly control blood glucose levels.Thus, severe microvascular complications associated with the disease may develop [3][4][5][6].Transplantation of an entire pancreas or pancreatic islets would potentially benefit millions of such patients [7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. Unfortunately, this alternative is extremely limited by the shortage of human donor organs available for transplantation [14][15][16].\n\nConsidering the ethical limitations associated with implementation of new strategies for islet allotransplantation, such as from human embryonic tissues, and the ongoing debate regarding the use of human embryonic stem cells or adult pancreatic stem cells for transplantation, the use of porcine tissues might potentially provide an attractive, unlimited source of pancreatic tissue [17].\n\nSeveral safety concerns, in particular the potential hazards associated with endogenous porcine retroviruses, have presented major obstacles to such xenotransplantation [18][19][20].However, it is important to note that previous pig-tohuman xenotransplantations have not revealed a single instance of porcine retrovirus transmission to a human [21].Moreover, a recent study has suggested that these viruses could be eradicated from pig herds bred specifically for xenotransplantation [22].Thus, as argued recently by Ogata and Platt [23], although the potential threat of porcine retroviruses to public health cannot be entirely dismissed, it should be approached by careful attention to the xenograft recipients, rather than being a reason for abandoning the xenotransplantation approach.",

This was later followed by corneal transplantations from pigs to humans and kidney transplantations in NHP [15,16]. The first pancreatic xenotransplantation was performed by Watson et al., implanted three ovine fragments into the subcutaneous plane of a diabetic patient. Though clinically significant blood glucose reduction was not demonstrated, the blood sugar level did decrease [17]. This pioneering work was followed by many experimental xenotransplantations, but results were mostly inconclusive [18][19][20][21]. Shumakov et al. reported 53 fetal porcine xenotransplants and 18 fetal bovine xenotranaplants in diabetic patients [22]. A century later, Groth et al. performed clinical xenotransplantation trial using fetal porcine islet cell-like clusters (ICCs) and provided preliminary data regarding the function and survival of grafts. After porcine islets were transplanted into 10 insulin-dependent diabetic kidney-transplant patients, detectable levels of porcine C-peptide were identified in the urine for up to 400 days and in one case, renal graft biopsy showed insulin and glucagon positive cells after staining [23]. Several xenotransplantation studies have also been performed in NHPs [20], and have succeeded in reversing diabetes [24][25][26][27] and in reducing daily insulin dosage requirement [28]. Transplanted porcine islet grafts were also shown to survive and function in NHPs for longer than 6 months with immunosuppression [25,27,29]. The longest survival rate is now over 603 days according to Shin et al.,[30]. Studies have also shown that microencapsulation of the transplanted islets and immune-isolation lead to better survival rate without the need for aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [26].",

            "text": "Porcine insulin is very close to human insulin with only one amino acid of difference, and for many years, until recombinant human insulin became available, it was used in clinical practice to treat diabetes [8] . In many other ways, the pig is a suitable source of islets for xenotransplantation into human recipients. In the last decade, several groups from around the world have shown success in restoring insulin independence for a period > 6 mo in diabetic nonhuman primate recipients of pig islets, a breakthrough achievement in xenotransplantation [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] . While the results of pigto-nonhuman primate models cannot fully predict the pig-to-human results due to dissimilarities among the different donors and recipient species, they are necessary steps to reach clinical application [18,19] . These results provide evidence that porcine islets would very likely function to restore glycemic control in humans. \n\nThe pig is already a potentially interesting donor for tissues and organs (in particular heart, kidney, lung and liver) due to the anatomical and size compatibility with human recipients. Many tissues (e.g., cardiac valves) are already broadly utilized with human patients [20] . While non-vascularized or decellularized tissues such as the valves are easier to implant than organs or islets, as they do not entail the complexity of dealing with xenorejection, the willingness of the public to accept porcine cardiac valves helps lay the groundwork for acceptance of additional medical uses for the pig. \n\nPractical considerations also make the pig a likely candidate for medical use. While nonhuman primates are the closest animals to humans from an evolutionary standpoint and, therefore, would be immunologically and physiologically more adaptive to human needs, their use in clinical xenotransplantation would not likely be accepted. Apes are endangered species, thus raising ethical concerns. They have litters of one or two offspring (like humans) and their growth requires years to reach full size, making it difficult to achieve a sufficient number of potential donors to satisfy demand.",

            "text": "This article reviews the rationale, sources and preparation of pig islets for xenotransplantation. Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is an attractive alternative and an effective treatment option for type 1 diabetes, however, donor pancreas shortages prevent islet transplantation from being a widespread solution as the supply cannot possibly equal the demand. Porcine islet xenotransplantation has the potential to address these shortages, and recent preclinical and clinical trials show promising scientific support. Pig islets provide a readily available source for islet transplantation, with the recent trials in non-human primates (NHPs) demonstrating their potential to reverse diabetes. The risk of zoonosis can be reduced by designated pathogen-free breeding of the donor pigs, but porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which are integrated into the genome of all pigs, are especially difficult to eliminate. However, clinical trials have demonstrated an absence of PERV transmission with a significant reduction in the number of severe hypoglycemic episodes and up to 30% reduction in exogenous insulin doses. A number of methods are currently being tested to overcome the xenograft immune rejection. Some of these methods include the production of various transgenic pigs to better xenotransplantation efficiency and the encapsulation of islets to isolate them from the host immune system. Furthermore, ongoing research is also shedding light on factors such as the age and breed of the donor pig to determine the optimal islet quantity and function.",

(1994) performed the first clinical islet xenotransplantation using foetal porcine islet cell-like clusters (ICCs), providing preliminary data for subsequent clinical islet xenotransplantation. There has also been some work in islet xenotransplantation from pigs to NHPs and successful reversal of recipient diabetes and achievement of long-term normoglycemia (Dufrane et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006;Cardona et al., 2007). Moreover, in some clinical trials (Yang and Yoon, 2015), xenografts were performed using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets, and the grafts were maintained for more than 2 years with a significant reduction in the number of hypoglycemic episodes. In islet xenotransplantation, islet encapsulation and gene editing technologies are currently used to alleviate rejection (Dhanasekaran et al., 2017). Targeted specific removal of porcine endogenous retroviruses from the genomes of porcine cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 can improve islet xenotransplantation safety. The production of pigs with multiple genetic modifications for xenotransplantation using the targeted specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 has been discussed in this paper and will not be discussed here.",

The primary objective is to utilize the combined pig islet-kidney to effectively treat both renal failure and diabetes in individuals suffering from diabetic nephropathy.

            "text": "Xenotransplantation holds a promising future for many patients, especially those with end-stage renal disease or absurd serum glucose levels. The ideal porcine candidate for xenotransplantation is a pig devoid of any zoonotic micro-organisms and PERV-C. PERV-inactivation has proved to be beneficial for successful xenotransplantation. Pigs that have been genetically modified to PERV have the potential to offer safe and effective organ and tissue supplies for xenotransplantation in the future. Combating zoonotic microorganisms can be accomplished through evaluation and screening processes and by breeding genes devoid of PERV, resulting in PERV knockout pigs, both of which may aid in reducing the risk of zoonotic infections. Pre-xenotransplantation microbial investigations, monitoring of the recipient, and a treatment plan designed especially for the recipient to avoid disease conditions all require careful planning. The latest innovations in xenotransplantation need to be built upon by evaluating the limitations of genetic engineering and proposing strategies for their advancement. Still, significant challenges to clinical human islet xenotransplantation are present, and future efforts should be directed toward developing an ideal genetically engineered swine islet donor source and establishing long-term viable islets with clinically meaningful immunosuppression. Researchers have proven that by successfully bypassing all the hurdles faced in xenotransplantation, in addition to being an effective means of obtaining normal blood glucose levels and reducing several illnesses associated with diabetes, it might embark a novel way for new therapeutic options for type 1 diabetic patients. Lowering the risk of post-xenotransplantation rejection reactions, IBMIR loss, acute inflammation, and chronic inflammatory markers in newly genetically modified porcines will not only increase graft survival but also further advance this field of research.",

Porcine islets, deemed a viable alternative, recently demonstrated successful longterm survival without zoonotic risks in a clinically relevant pig-to-non-human primate islet transplantation model. This success prompted the development of a clinical trial protocol for porcine islet xenotransplantation in humans. Methods A single-center, open-label clinical trial initiated by the sponsor will assess the safety and efficacy of porcine islet transplantation for diabetes patients at Gachon Hospital. The protocol received approval from the Gachon Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) under the Investigational New Drug (IND) process. Two diabetic patients, experiencing inadequate glycemic control despite intensive insulin treatment and frequent hypoglycemic unawareness, will be enrolled. Participants and their family members will engage in deliberation before xenotransplantation during the screening period. Each patient will receive islets isolated from designated pathogen-free pigs. Immunosuppressants and systemic infection prophylaxis will follow the program schedule. The primary endpoint is to confirm the safety of porcine islets in patients, and the secondary endpoint is to assess whether porcine islets can reduce insulin dose and the frequency of hypoglycemic unawareness. Conclusion A clinical trial protocol adhering to global consensus guidelines for porcine islet xenotransplantation is presented, facilitating streamlined implementation of comparable human trials worldwide.",

Additionally, their heart and liver are smaller compared with that of other mammals, including wild pigs, which is an additional concept that must be considered during results comparisons or interpretations of models in which domestic pigs are shown to be different from miniature pigs that have not been selected for the economic burden of metabolic traits. This difference may result in changes in several organ sizes and functions.\n\nDiabetes genetic risk variants have become an issue in humans and in pig models of various interaction forms, including pediatric, juvenile, male, female, and castrated plus domestic verses miniature pig models that address insulitis-T1DM or T2DM. Recently, porcine islets have received more attention for xenotransplantation because once these islets have been genetically modified; they can overcome rejection to some extent [36]. Thus, in theory, genetic modified pigs preselected with the TCF7L2 protective type C/C may provide better or longer lasting islet xenografts to diabetic patients compared with pigs with the T/T sensitive type. The present study points out genetics and other related concerns of diabetes-pig model and emphasizes that well-designed diabetic pig studies could provide useful insights for metabolic syndromes and would likely be of interest for investigations of the glucose homeostasis of pigs, which is similar to that of humans.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation, a type of medical procedure that could potentially overcome the shortage of human organs for transplantation, relies on the use of domestic pigs as donors of organs and tissues. Xenotransplants could also serve as a temporary solution until an appropriate human donor is found. The possibility of individual transplant selection with regard to size and age represents an additional argument for the use of pigs as donors. Genetically modified pigs are a potential source of cells and tissues for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and corneal opacity (Denner, 2016b;Cooper et al., 2017;Walters and Burlak, 2017). Currently, intensive research is being carried out on the utility of porcine kidney, heart, lung, and liver tissues for xenotransplantation (Cooper et al., 2017;Meier et al., 2017;Walters and Burlak, 2017). Porcine liver tissue could also serve as a source of modified hepatocytes for the treatment of patients with congenital metabolic pathologies in order to rebalance the level of hepatic enzymes. In addition, porcine hepatocytes could be used ex vivo in liver perfusion-assist devices (Cooper et al., 2017). Diabetes mellitus type 1 affects millions of people worldwide, resulting in immense treatment costs. Intensive research is currently focused on the transplantation of encapsulated islets of genetically modified pigs into humans (Cooper et al., 2017;Dhanasekaran et al., 2017). The application of genetically engineered porcine tissues can also serve as a temporary skin xenograft in the treatment of severe wounds (Nessler and Chrapusta, 2013;Scobie et al., 2013). In ophthalmology, clinical trials utilizing decellularized porcine corneas recellurized by autologous keratocytes are underway (Hara and Cooper, 2011;Kim and Hara, 2015). The pigs could also be considered as donors of erythrocytes in transfusiology (Cooper et al., 2017). \n\nThe immunological barriers responsible for transplant rejection, as well as those connected with the risk of the cross-species transmission of PERVs, are being systematically reduced.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is not yet standard treatment. There is current research into the feasibility of using donor animal organs such a kidney and liver. However, unlike cells, organs are difficult to screen against potential infectious agents. If clinical trials with cell transplants for diabetes are successful, porcine islet transplants will lead the way for the use of other cells for the treatment of nervous system disorders and enzyme deficiencies (Skinner et al, 2009). \n\nPorcine islet xenotransplantation has the potential to be beneficial for those with absolute insulin deficiency. There is now a consensus that the procedure is relatively safe from xenotic infections. The results of several non-human primate and rodent studies indicate significant efficacy may be achieved. The early results of human clinical trials also suggest that this form of treatment for Type 1 diabetes, without immunosuppression, is worthwhile. There is the concern that the treatment may be too expensive to be a practical treatment for the large numbers of patients who are expected to benefit from porcine islet implants. However, a health economic analysis of quality adjusted life years suggests that this approach may be cost effective taking into account the current cost of treating the disease and complications of cardiovascular disease, blindness, limb amputation, end-stage kidney disease and neuropathy (Beckwith et al, 2010).",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the destruction of insulin-releasing \u03b2-cells in the pancreatic islets. Approximately 3.3% to 13.5% of patients with T1DM experience unstable blood glucose regulation and recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms despite appropriate insulin therapy 1,2 . For these patients, pancreas/islet transplantation is a promising therapeutic option; however, it is hampered by the shortage and non-uniform quality of cells in clinical settings 3 . In this context, stem cell-derived islets have gained attention as an alternative cell source owing to the feasibility of largescale cell manufacturing with uniform quality 4,5 . \n\nT1DM rodent models are often used to assess the engraftment and functioning of human primary and stem cellderived islets. However, humans and rodents exhibit significant differences in terms of anatomy, body size, and blood volume. These variations may lead to translational challenges; thus, the use of animal models closer in size to humans is preferable to obtain translatable results for clinical applications. Among the many experimental animals, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs), and pigs 6,7 are commonly used. In addition, mini-pig skin resembles human skin in multiple aspects such as cell components and the thickness of individual skin layers 8,9 . In fact, pigs have been used to evaluate subcutaneously implanted human-sized surgical devices 10 , as well as insulin pumps, whose catheters are inserted into the subcutaneous space 11 . Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models 12 . Itoh et al. 12 recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

It seems apparent that besides the current technological difficulties regarding proliferative capacity and phenotype maintenance, also the time requirements limit the clinical use of primary human cells. Together with the lack of human donors, this stimulated the search for alternative sources of cells. Pigs emerged as promising candidates for the production of donor tissues as they resemble many anatomical and physiological features of humans. For the cardiovascular system in particular, properties like an identical heart weight to body weight ratio, similar coronary circulation and hemodynamics, as well as comparable healing characteristics of the myocardium [7] rendered pigs not only as a suitable model organism but also as a potential donor for heart xenotransplantation.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, studies in diabetic animal models have demonstrated that porcine islet cell transplantation was sufficient to normalize blood glucose in the recipients, thus proving physiologic activity and metabolic regulation across the species barrier [8,9]. These findings raised hope for the implementation of xenogeneic cell replacement as potential therapy for a multitude of human diseases and disorders and inspired a number of research activities in the newly emerging field of xenogeneic cell therapy [10][11][12]. In fact, translation into clinical trials was achieved for the application of porcine islets of Langerhans with [13] and without Sertoli cells [14] to treat diabetic patients. Long-term follow-up studies documented decreased insulin requirements in a majority of patients [15] and the recent development of encapsulation strategies is supposed to overcome remaining immunological complications [16].",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease wherein the pancreas does not produce enough insulin due to islet beta cell destruction. Despite improvements in delivering exogenous insulin to T1D patients, pancreas or islet transplantation remains the best way to regulate their glycaemia. Results from experimental islet transplantation have improved dramatically in the last 15 years, to the point where it can be comparable to pancreas transplantation, but without the accompanying morbidity associated with this procedure. As with other transplants, the limiting factor in islet allotransplantation is the relatively small number of organs made available by deceased human donors throughout the world. A strong case can be made for islet xenotransplantation to fill the gap between supply and demand; however, transplantation across species presents challenges that are unique to that setting. In the search for the most suitable animal for human xenotransplantation, the pig has many advantages that make it the likely animal of choice. Potentially one of the most beneficial advantages is the ability to genetically engineer porcine donors to be more compatible with human recipients. Several genetic manipulations have already proven useful in relation to hyperacute rejection and inflammation (instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction), with the potential of even further advancement in the near future.",

There have been a few surveys and one interview study with potential xenograft recipients and two interview studies with actual xenotransplantation patients. All study participants were T1DM patients. \n\nAmong the participants of a survey study with diabetes patients (type 1 and 2), 79% would accept the transplantation of porcine islet cells [10]. Of those, 40% could imagine facing psychological problems due to having porcine cells in their body. Another survey with T1DM patients reported an acceptance rate of 52% [11]. However, a majority (70.5%) opted against xenotransplantation when they learned about the potential transmission of unknown diseases, the risks of immunosuppression, and that the transplantation might not result in complete insulin independence. \n\nA questionnaire study about four alternative therapies for diabetes was conducted among 85 patients with T1DM [12]. In addition to islet cell xenotransplantation, allogeneic islet transplantation, DNA vaccination, and induced pluripotent stem cell therapy (IPS) were presented. The preferred treatment was IPS (77.3%), followed by allogeneic islet transplantation (54.3%), xenotransplantation ranked third (52.2%) before DNA vaccination (41.3%). The participants reported the prospect of being insulin independent as the most important motivator for accepting a new therapy, ahead of avoiding hypoglycaemia. \n\nA recent study among 47 patients with T1DM with a similar research design compared several forms of allogeneic islet transplantation, IPS and (multiple and single) islet xenotransplantation [13]. While 83.3% of the participants would accept IPS, 66.7% would accept single and 46.3% multiple xenotransplantation. The single encapsulated form of allogeneic islet transplantation received the highest acceptance rate of 50%. Again, the majority of patients aimed to become independent of insulin.",

            "text": "Several studies have examined the views of diabetes patients who qualify as potential recipients of islet cell xenotransplantation on this potential diabetes therapy. There have been a few surveys and one interview study with potential xenograft recipients and two interview studies with actual xenotransplantation patients. All study participants were T1DM patients. \n\nAmong the participants of a survey study with diabetes patients (type 1 and 2), 79% would accept the transplantation of porcine islet cells [10]. Of those, 40% could imagine facing psychological problems due to having porcine cells in their body. Another survey with T1DM patients reported an acceptance rate of 52% [11]. However, a majority (70.5%) opted against xenotransplantation when they learned about the potential transmission of unknown diseases, the risks of immunosuppression, and that the transplantation might not result in complete insulin independence. \n\nA questionnaire study about four alternative therapies for diabetes was conducted among 85 patients with T1DM [12]. In addition to islet cell xenotransplantation, allogeneic islet transplantation, DNA vaccination, and induced pluripotent stem cell therapy (IPS) were presented. The preferred treatment was IPS (77.3%), followed by allogeneic islet transplantation (54.3%), xenotransplantation ranked third (52.2%) before DNA vaccination (41.3%). The participants reported the prospect of being insulin independent as the most important motivator for accepting a new therapy, ahead of avoiding hypoglycaemia. \n\nA recent study among 47 patients with T1DM with a similar research design compared several forms of allogeneic islet transplantation, IPS and (multiple and single) islet xenotransplantation [13]. While 83.3% of the participants would accept IPS, 66.7% would accept single and 46.3% multiple xenotransplantation. The single encapsulated form of allogeneic islet transplantation received the highest acceptance rate of 50%. Again, the majority of patients aimed to become independent of insulin.",

            "text": "This new treatment modality was tested in rats, and authors concluded that it was a promising approach for safe and effective islet transplantation and long-term type 1 DM management. \n\nHuman pluripotent stem cell-derived islets were produced in different laboratories worldwide and studied in animal models, with some promising results and a potential cell resource for diabetes treatment [81,82]. However, these new approaches have not been systematically assessed in humans or animal models physiologically similar to humans [80]. Xenogeneic islets isolated from pigs is another area of research. Trials of porcine islet xenografts transplanted into primate models have shown a potential to achieve insulin independence and prolonged islet-graft function (>600 days) [34,35]. The disadvantage is that it seems to cause a greater immunological hurdle compared with islet allotransplantation [26,83]. \n\nThese efforts in engineering, regenerative medicine, and xenogeneic islets from pigs will meet some issues concerning their clinical application in humans and ethical concerns regarding their origin, as well as how, when, and where will patients have access to these advanced therapies. There are several dangers associated with xenotransplantation, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, animal welfare, and fair distribution of organs [84]. With a shortage of human tissue available, it is no wonder that researchers have considered the pig as a potential source. For example, porcine valves are routinely used in aortic valve replacements in the UK. However, there is currently no legislation which specifically regulates xenotransplantation in the UK, but a non-statutory body, the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) exists to monitor developments in the xenotransplantation field. \n\nThe lack of uniform definitions for success in \u03b2-cell replacement therapy should be addressed in order to make treatment options comparable in the future [26].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation: the need, the problems and the progress Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues and organs is being developed in response to the steadily decreasing availability of human organs and due to an increased need by the aging human population [1]. In the US, 114,965 people are in desperate need of a lifesaving organ transplant (total waiting list candidates) and of those, 74,816 people are active waiting list candidates [2]. In contrast, only 2853 transplantations were performed in January 2018. On average, 20 people die each day while waiting for a transplant. Xenotransplantation using pig islet cells may be also the most effective solution for the treatment of diabetes. In 2015, 30.3 million Americans, or 9.4% of the population, had diabetes, among them 1.25 million American children and adults with type 1 diabetes [3]. Although type 1 diabetes can be treated with insulin, complications including limb amputations and blindness due to poor patient compliance are the main cost factors when treating the disease. Pig islet cells producing insulin under biological regulation may therefore be the better solution. \n\nPigs, for several reasons including similar physiology, size, low costs as well as the ability to be cloned and easily genetically modified, are the most suitable donor animals. Pig insulin was used for decades to treat diabetes until recombinant human insulin became available. Although there are several barriers to successful clinical xenotransplantation including immunological rejection, physiological incompatibility and the risk of transmission of porcine microorganisms to the human xenotransplant recipient, significant progress has been made in recent years [4,5]. The problem of immunological rejection can be solved by multiple genetic modifications in the pigs and a more effective immunosuppression [6,7]. As a result, the recently measured survival times of pig organ transplants in non-human primates are impressive: pig islet cells can maintain insulin-independent normoglycemia for up to 950 days in diabetic monkeys [8] and the best survival time for the heterotopic transplantation of pig hearts to non-human primates has increased to 945 days [9].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation: the need, the problems and the progress Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues and organs is being developed in response to the steadily decreasing availability of human organs and due to an increased need by the aging human population [1]. In the US, 114,965 people are in desperate need of a lifesaving organ transplant (total waiting list candidates) and of those, 74,816 people are active waiting list candidates [2]. In contrast, only 2853 transplantations were performed in January 2018. On average, 20 people die each day while waiting for a transplant. Xenotransplantation using pig islet cells may be also the most effective solution for the treatment of diabetes. In 2015, 30.3 million Americans, or 9.4% of the population, had diabetes, among them 1.25 million American children and adults with type 1 diabetes [3]. Although type 1 diabetes can be treated with insulin, complications including limb amputations and blindness due to poor patient compliance are the main cost factors when treating the disease. Pig islet cells producing insulin under biological regulation may therefore be the better solution. \n\nPigs, for several reasons including similar physiology, size, low costs as well as the ability to be cloned and easily genetically modified, are the most suitable donor animals. Pig insulin was used for decades to treat diabetes until recombinant human insulin became available. Although there are several barriers to successful clinical xenotransplantation including immunological rejection, physiological incompatibility and the risk of transmission of porcine microorganisms to the human xenotransplant recipient, significant progress has been made in recent years [4,5]. The problem of immunological rejection can be solved by multiple genetic modifications in the pigs and a more effective immunosuppression [6,7]. As a result, the recently measured survival times of pig organ transplants in non-human primates are impressive: pig islet cells can maintain insulin-independent normoglycemia for up to 950 days in diabetic monkeys [8] and the best survival time for the heterotopic transplantation of pig hearts to non-human primates has increased to 945 days [9].",

Safety concerns related to porcine islet transplantation have also been significantly lessened by the fact that no infection had been detected in several clinical studies using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets and porcine islets cotransplanted with Sertoli cells. Importantly, clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimen without anti-CD154 antibody is now being developed. Our detailed procedures of porcine islet isolation from DPF miniature pigs, islet transplantation, immune monitoring with peripheral blood after transplantation, and biopsy and subsequent immunohistochemistry described in this chapter will help other scientists to expedite clinical realization of naked porcine islet transplantation using clinically acceptable immunosuppression in the near future. Also, a quantum leap in advances on gene editing technique that will generate multiple genetically modified pigs or possibly PERV-free pigs within a few months, and on generation of interspecies chimera that will provide human organs in the pigs will heighten the potential of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Present methods for treating IDDM, including insulin administration and antidiabetic drugs, are not effective in preventing adverse complications, especially long-term complications (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993). Replacing pancreatic endocrine tissue via islet transplantation is a physiological approach to particular restoration of hyperglycemia in IDDM patients (Narang and Mahato, 2006). Segmental pancreatic grafts obviate the need for exogenous insulin and postpone development of glomerular lesions in diabetic patients. However, the supply of donor organs is clearly a significant limitation of allotransplantation. To overcome this supply problem, microencapsulated islet cells from pigs are currently under consideration for xenotransplantation (Shapiro et al., 2000;Ryan et al., 2001Ryan et al., , 2002)). The shortage of pancreases from human donors remains a primary obstacle to routine use of islet transplants as a treatment option (Brunicardi and Mullen, 1994). Furthermore, the desire to transplant microencapsulated islet tissue without need for immunosuppression has resulted in the development of immunoisolation devices (Lim and Sun, 1980;Rayat et al., 1999). Islets encapsulation is a frequently explored immunoisolation approach. For decades, IDDM patients have been using porcine insulin (Krickhahn et al., 2002). The pig is currently regarded as an ideal source for microencapsulated islet cells for clinical xenotransplantation (Rayat et al., 1999). Therefore, isolating viable and functional porcine islet cells is a critical issue. \n\nPorcine pancreatic islets may be a potential source for islet xenografts for diabetic patients because of following reasons. Firstly, pig insulin has been used in humans for patients with diabetes mellitus for a long time (Krickhahn et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Pig islet xenoTx shows important, but not insurmountable limitations, even if recent accomplishments in preclinical pig-to-NHP model hold great promises and may have future implications. Concerning preclinical animal models of islet xenoTx there are some relevant considerations on speciesspecific glucose metabolism. For instance, pigs and humans share blood glucose levels in similar concentrations, whereas nondiabetic monkeys exhibit lower unstimulated blood glucose. Endogenous C-peptide levels in monkeys are in higher ranges than in humans, and substantially higher than in pigs. When porcine islets engraft in diabetic NHPs they need to adapt to the higher metabolic demands of their recipients. This results in new cutoff parameters of glucose metabolism associated with good graft islet function, intermediate between donor and recipient baselines [37]. We may envision that, based on the metabolic differences between humans and monkeys, humans and pigs, porcine islets would perform more efficiently in humans than in monkeys. Nonetheless, to pursue the use of porcine islets in preclinical as well as clinical models it is necessary to modify the immunosuppressive protocols and to evaluate agents that can be substitutes for anti-CD154 antibodies, critical and effective components of major studies [16,17,46] because of their thromboembolic effect. Preliminary studies suggest that antagonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies could be equally effective when combined with IL-2R antibodies, CD28 antagonists, and sirolimus. Several other immunosuppressant agents are currently under investigation [54]. \n\nIn the future, immunosuppressive molecules should be selected based on their ability to facilitate negative vaccination systems during the pretransplantation phase by administration of donor antigen to the recipient. The immunological obstacles to xenoTx are significant. A way to reduce the immune response after implantation of pig islet cells in the recipient is the use of transgenic animals. Good results using pigs expressing hCD46 (a human complement-regulatory protein) suggest that protection from complement activation is beneficial to survival of the graft (Fig. 1) [15\u2022].",

However, considering the huge number of patients with type 1 diabetes, human donor shortage is a serious issue. To overcome the donor shortage issue, xenotransplantation is an attractive option. In fact, clinical islet xenotransplantation has been conducted since 1990s. The first clinical trial was performed using fetal pigs and demonstrated the porcine pancreatic tissue could survive in human body with immunosuppressive strategies. To scale up the islet production, Canadian group established a method for islet isolation from neonatal pigs. Their method has been used for clinical islet xenotransplantation in New Zealand, Russian, Mexico, Argentina, and China. Recently Korean group published a clinical protocol for islet xenotransplantation using adult pigs. For the next generation of islet xenotransplantation, gene-modified pigs were created. Especially \u201csuperislets\u201d created by Belgian group demonstrated promising preclinical outcomes. With advanced donor pigs, islet xenotransplantation might become a suitable treatment for the majority of type 1 diabetic patients.

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic disease affecting over 463 million people globally, as recently reported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). 1 Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease in which beta cells are completely destroyed, resulting in metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of insufficient circulating levels of insulin. 2,3 Insulin therapy (exogenous insulin) is a principle method of treatment, but it does not mimic exactly the physiology of insulin secretion in the body. 4 The alternative is pancreas transplantation and/or pancreatic islet cell transplantation. \n\nHowever, the severe shortage of available cadaveric donors limited the widespread adoption of this transplantation. 5 In addition, the number of pancreases and islet quality decreased by several factors, including increasing donor age and obesity. 6 For these reasons, many researchers studied alternative source of islets to solve these key supply problems. Xenotransplantation using pig islets is one of the candidates for clinical transplantation into diabetic patients. Successful xenotransplantation from pigs to humans provides a potential unlimited supply of tissues and cells, resolving the shortage of donor tissues for transplantation. 7 Several research groups studied islet xenotransplantation using pigs as the source of insulin-producing cells. 8 There has been considerable research exploring the use of purified enzyme blends in islet isolation that have been specifically developed for islet isolation in an attempt to improve consistency and increase yields and function of isolated islets. 9 Since 2006, a total of 9 groups performed non-human primate experiments using porcine islets. In 2015, Shin JS et al 10 reported on islets isolated from two pigs transplanted into 4-to 6-kg non-human primates (NHPs). \n\nPorcine islets were isolated using Liberase MTF C/T GMP-grade enzymes. They also used Cobra Venom Factor (CVF), anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody and ATG induction, and sirolimus immunosuppression, in addition to anti-CD154. 3 of 5 recipients also received ex vivo expanded regulatory T-cell therapy.",

Negative controls were present in previous studies of composite IK technologiesin pig-to-pig, baboon-tobaboon, and macaque-to-macaque modelsand demonstrated preservation of islets with composite I-K transplantation across allogeneic barriers. In the past year, due to lack of inbred or cloned source pigs, we tested an alternative strategy for combined islet and kidney transplantation across a xenogeneic barrier that would also serve as a control of the composite I-K strategy. This alternative approach involves delayed islet transplantation after kidney and vascularized thymus transplantation (role of vascularized thymus transplantation in the induction of tolerance across xenogeneic barriers reviewed in (28)), using a recipient size-matched kidney and thymus source pig, as well as a large source pig for islets. Notably this approach (without thymus co-transplantation) is also similar to recent work in human islet-after-kidney transplantation conducted by the CIT consortium. Although additional cases are required, we have achieved reversal of diabetes and life-supporting renal function for 180 days with this kidney-first sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation (52). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of maintenance of durable normoglycemia and stable creatinine with porcine kidney and islets in a diabetic and life-supporting pig-to-baboon combined kidney, vascularized thymus and islet xenotransplantation model. These preliminary results were recently presented at the International Xenotransplantation Association Congress (San Diego, 2023), and are described in detail in the following sections:",

Free (nonencapsulated) pig islets (either wildtype or genetically-engineered) have maintained normoglycemia in immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for N1 year (Park et al., 2015). Immunoisolated (encapsulated) pig islets have maintained normoglycemia in non-immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for up to 6 months (Dufrane et al., 2006). \n\nGroth et al. performed the first clinical islet xenotransplantation in 1994 using fetal porcine islet-like cell clusters placed under the kidney capsule (Groth et al., 1994). Although clinical benefit was not demonstrated, evidence was provided by measurement of porcine C-peptide that porcine islets could survive in the human body. The first nationally-regulated clinical trial of intra-peritoneal alginate-poly-L-ornithinealginate (APA) encapsulated (neonatal) porcine islet xenotransplantation in nonimmunosuppressed diabetic patients was carried out in New Zealand and was associated with some reduction in hypoglycemic unawareness (Matsumoto et al., 2014). However, there was a lack of correlation between the number of islets transplanted and the clinical outcome; the transplantation of 5000 IEq/kg was associated with better results than of 15,000 or 20,000 IEq/kg. \n\nIn this issue of EBioMedicine, Matsumoto et al. report the second clinical trial of nationally-regulated encapsulated porcine islet xenotransplantation, conducted in Argentina (Matsumoto et al., 2016). From their previous experience, the authors speculated that a large islet mass was susceptible to injury from oxygen and/or nutrient insufficiency, resulting in cell death.",

Recent clinical and preclinical trials of islet cell transplantation and xenotransplantation, respectively, suggest that xenogeneic cellular therapy may indeed provide a viable option for the treatment of diabetes. Serendipitously, adult pig islets do not express the galactosyl-\u03b1-1,3-galactose epitope. Instead, rejection [39] of xenogeneic islets in NHPs results from direct or indirect activation of T cells by donor pig xenopeptides. Targeted prevention of T cell co-stimulation has led to great strides in pig islet xenotransplantation to NHPs [40,41]. However, maintenance of immunosuppression puts patients at risk for opportunistic infections, and can cause significant cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, and (in female patients) reproductive toxicity [42,43]. Pig transgenesis could provide an alternative approach to systemic T-cell costimulation blockade, instead relying on the local provision of immunotherapeutic proteins by the xenograft [44,45].\n\nPrevention of zoonotic transmission of pathogens from donor pigs to patients is also crucial for clinical application of porcine xenotransplantation. Although husbandry in a biosecure environment can eliminate most risk, endogenous agents such as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) require special attention. Indeed, upon co-cultivation of pig and human cells, PERVs inefficiently traverse the species barrier [46][47][48]. Although no evidence of pig to human transfer has ever been observed in vivo [49][50][51], it is prudent to develop pigs with a reduced genetic potential for PERV transmission [52][53][54][55][56].",

Before organ retrieval, the animals were housed under standard conditions (19\u00b0C-23\u00b0C; 40%-70% relative humidity; 12:12 h day: night cycle) and fed twice daily with special minipig pelleted food (Ellegard). Water was provided ad libitum. Before this nonhuman study, they conducted 21 porcine islet isolations 28 . They used four young minipigs and 17 retired breeder minipigs and found that the usage of retired breeder animals resulted in high quality and quantity of islets. Therefore, for the nonhuman primate study, female retired breeder minipigs with an average age of 3-4 years and average pregnancies of three to four times were used. They isolated islets using Ricordi method and purified islets with discontinuous gradient centrifugation. Isolated islets were immobilized in alginate and put into the unique device (Fig. 1).

            "text": "An estimated 22 million people currently suffer from type 1 diabetes mellitus (1). This incredible burden is treated with various forms of exogenous insulin therapy but whole pancreas or islet cell transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment. Pancreas or islet transplantation restores glucose homeostasis without constant external monitoring and prevents the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, dramatically improving the patient's quality of life and attenuating the secondary complications of diabetes (2). However, there are too few organ donors to provide enough pancreata for even a fraction of the patients who would benefit from transplantation. This shortage has stimulated extensive research into the use of pigs as alternative islet donors. One advantage of using pigs is that they can be genetically modified to protect islet xenografts from immunological challenges including the intense innate response triggered by intraportal delivery, known as the instant bloodmediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) (3). \n\nOld World non-human primates (NHP) provide the best preclinical model for xenotransplantation of adult porcine islets or neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC), because like humans they possess pre-existing antibodies to the dominant carbohydrate xenoantigen galactose-a1,3-galactose (aGal). Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are the most widely used NHP model in islet xenotransplantation. Shin et al. achieved a median survival of 10 months for wild-type (WT) adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (4,5). However, a high dose of islets was required, along with a complex immunosuppressive protocol that would be unacceptable in the clinic. A more clinically applicable regimen was less effective at preventing rejection and significantly reduced the duration of insulin-independent normoglycemia (6). Graham et al. used clinically available immunosuppressants to achieve median survival of 147 days for WT adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (7). However, recipients developed a state of systemic inflammation associated with increased incidence and severity of adverse events.",

Tables 2,  3, and 4 summarize selected studies in solid organ (heart, kidney, and liver) and islet xenotransplantation with a specific use of anti-CD154mAb (Table 2), anti-CD40mAb (Table 3), or CTLA4-Ig (Table 4) between 2000 (the first use of costimulation blockade in xenotransplantation) to 2017. Continued development and improvement upon immunosuppressive regimens and the introduction of novel experimental agents appear to have contributed to this progress. Studies from the early part of the previous decade showed that induction therapy followed by highdose conventional combination maintenance regimens was generally (but not uniformly) sufficient to sustain lifesupporting pig grafts in nonhuman primates [73]. Conventional immunosuppressive therapy included agents such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methylprednisone, and prednisolone (Tables 2, 3, and 4). In 2000, Buhler et al. introduced the concept of costimulation blockade to the field of xenotransplantation [74]. Using a murine anti-human CD154mAb, they attempted to induce immune tolerance in nonhuman primates to transplanted pig peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). More preclinical studies followed in both solid organ and islet xenotransplantation ( Table 2) and increased markedly in the following decades. The most studied costimulatory modifiers within xenotransplantation have included anti-CD154mAb (Table 2), anti-CD40mAb (Table 3), and the CD28/B7 pathway (including CTLA4-Ig proteins abatacept and belatacept, as well as anti-CD28mAb, Table 4).

For successful pancreatic islet xenotransplantation using porcine pancreatic islets, efficacy and safety must first be demonstrated in pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) preclinical studies, as outlined in the consensus statement of the International Xenotransplantation Association. Our group has achieved long-term survival of wild-type porcine islet grafts in immunosuppressed NHPs by employing two immunosuppressive protocols: one based on CD40-CD40L blockade and another utilizing clinically available immunosuppressants. A clinical trial for pancreatic islet xenotransplantation, following the latter protocol, has received approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). This review aims to highlight the results of clinical trials involving porcine islet xenotransplantation to date, along with the age-specific and other characteristics of the porcine islets used in these trials and the preclinical NHP studies that support them. It offers insights into the perspectives around the first clinical islet xenotransplantation approved by the Korean MFDS, emphasizing improved long-term graft survival.",

            "text": "Islet xenotransplantation is a promising alternative approach to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) treatment and has achieved long-term normoglycemia in porcine-to-primate studies (247-249). Based on preliminary studies in NHPs, the first case of clinical islet xenotransplantation to human can be traced back to 1994 (250). Currently, clinical trials using islet xenotransplantation are developing more rapidly than those in other xenotransplantation areas. In 2014, a clinical trial using islet xenotransplantation under regulatory framework was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (251). This was followed by Phase I/IIa and IIb clinical trials using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets in xenotransplantation performed in Argentina (252), which resulted in a mean transplant estimated function of approximately 0.5, with transplants maintained for more than two years, and a significant reduction in the number of unaware hypoglycemia episodes. Surely, there are still many problems to be solved for islet xenotransplantation before reaching their clinical use, including physiological function consistency, immune rejection, islet loss, and prevention of PERVs infection (253). Immune rejections included HAR, mediated by Gal and non-Gal antigens (254), instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) that may have provoked 60-80% of islet loss (255), and CD4 + T cell-mediated cellular rejection that plays a major role in islet destruction (256). Strategies to alleviate rejection mainly include islet encapsulation and gene editing technology. Recent clinical trials mainly focused on encapsulating the neonatal porcine islets in different high molecular compounds (257). While cell encapsulation technology can potentially shield the islets from the host's immune rejection at initial stage, long-term therapeutic efficacy is still a challenge (258). Another hot spot of research is to attempt different transplantation sites, including the portal vein, subrenal capsule, subcutaneously, the muscle, spleen, gastric submucosal space and peritoneum, depending on the islet volume and its",

Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy. Rat pancreatic islets were encapsulated in highly purified alginate and integrated into a plastic macrochamber covered by a poly-membrane for subcutaneous transplantation. Diabetic Sinclair pigs were transplanted and followed for up to 90 days. We demonstrated a persistent graft function and restoration of normoglycemia without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This concept could potentially offer an attractive strategy for a more widespread islet replacement therapy that would restore endogenous insulin secretion in diabetic patients without the need for immunosuppressive drugs and may even open up an avenue for safe utilization of xenogeneic islet donors.",

Individuals suffering from diabetes who are facing repeated and intense unawareness of hypoglycemia even after receiving the best possible medical treatment may be the most appropriate individuals to consider as potential candidates. Those with diabetic nephropathy would benefit from the successful transplantation of both a pig kidney and pig islets. The low risk in pig islet xenotransplantation trials is attributed to rigorous safety protocols, including genetic engineering of pigs to reduce human immune reactions and meticulous screening for pathogens. This approach minimizes potential zoonotic infections and immunogenic complications. Compliance with FDA regulations is ensured through adherence to established guidelines for xenotransplantation, encompassing product safety, ethical standards, and clinical trial conduct. Detailing these aspects can enhance the research's credibility, demonstrating a commitment to safety, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations in advancing xenotransplantation as a therapeutic option.

Hecht et al. [13] (Weizmann Institute) applied findings generated in mice (Tchorsh-Yutsis et al.) [14] to a non-human primate model. The mouse studies had demonstrated the curative potential of such implants in diabetic mice under relatively tolerable immune suppression. A working hypothesis, suggesting that embryonic pig pancreas transplantation would not be adversely affected by a humoral response was based on 2 observations: 1) hyperacute and acute rejection are mainly mediated by complement activation in blood vessels, mediated by preformed anti-pig antibodies recognizing carbohydrates expressed on endothelial cells; and 2) data from the mouse studies showed that the embryonic pancreas implants predominantly induce host-type vasculature to support their growth and development in the recipient, resulting in an organ comprised mainly of porcine epithelial cells and host endothelium. It was found that that porcine E42 embryonic pancreatic tissue can correct hyperglycemia in diabetic Cynomolgous monkeys under a tolerable immune suppression protocol and was concluded that long-term proliferative capacity of these grafts, their ability to induce revascularization by host endothelium, and their reduced immunogenicity, suggest that porcine embryonic xenotransplantation could offer an attractive replacement therapy for diabetes [13,14]. Host immune suppression was required for successful engraftment of embryonic pig pancreas in rodents [14] or non-human primates [13] in the studies of Tchorsh-Yutsis et al. and Hecht et al. It is likely that one or more factors in the methodology we employ different from that used by these investigators is critical for engraftment without an immune suppression requirement. We have speculated regarding what the factors might be [4].",

A pig with four modified genes, (i) GTKO, and (ii) hCD46, (iii) human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (hTFPI) for antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and (iv) CTLA4-Ig to inhibit cellular immune responses, demonstrated improved success rates in retaining islet mass early postoperatively and maintaining islet implantation and function for up to one year during transplantation (242). This study also provided preliminary insights into glucose metabolism in pigs expressing human genes regulated by the insulin promoter, demonstrating that multiple islet-targeting transgenes inserted into pigs were not harmful to islet function and opened the door to further experiments and genetic manipulation for islet xenotransplantation (243). Multigene donor pigs have been shown to be a reproducibly effective source of islets for pig-tonon-human primate xenotransplantation (209). CG Park and colleagues at Seoul National University in Korea are conducting ongoing research of great significance for islet xenotransplantation, successfully maintaining normal blood glucose levels in diabetic primates within 600 days post porcine islet transplantation (244). A common feature of these successful long-term porcine-to-nonhuman primate islet studies is the use of CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based immunosuppression to prevent rejection. \n\nAlthough there is evidence that anti-CD154 mAb is effective and safe in pig-to-non-human primate islet transplantation models (245), it is associated with thromboembolic complications in humans and is not clinically translatable. \n\nDespite promising data on the use of anti-CD40 antibody (costimulatory blockade) in organ xenotransplantation (246, 247), the islet xenotransplantation community is still searching for a clinically translatable immunosuppressant that can successfully prevent rejection without causing excessive side effects.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues, and organs is under development in order to alleviate the shortage of human donor organs. In the case of kidney allotransplantation, 40% of wait-listed patients are likely to die within five years, since chronic dialysis is a suboptimal form of therapy for many, and their quality of life remains poor [1]. Diabetes patients often suffer, due to insufficient compliance, from later complications despite insulin treatment. Since the supply of human pancreata or islet cells is very low [2], only xenotransplantation of pig islet cells may solve this problem. \n\nPigs are suitable as donor animals, and they are advantageous due to their nearly unlimited availability, short breeding time, and large litters. Pig kidneys and hearts are comparable in size and function to human organs. There is a high physiological similarity, as, for example, pig insulin has been used to treat diabetes for decades. Pigs can be easily genetically modified and cloned, and pig farming is less expensive. In contrast, apes are endangered species, and most monkeys are too small to serve as donor animals. \n\nXenotransplantation must overcome three hurdles on its way into the clinic: rejection, especially hyperacute rejection (HAR); physiological incompatibility; and the risk of transmission of zoonotic pig microorganisms. HAR is based on the presence of preexisting antibodies against sugar residues present on pig proteins, but absent on human proteins. Zoonotic means that the pig microorganisms not only infect the transplant recipient, but induce a more or less severe disease. Whereas most pig viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa can be eliminated by selection, vaccination, antiviral drugs, early weaning, colostrum deprivation, and embryo transfer, that is not possible for the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), because they are integrated in the genome of the pigs.",

            "text": "Many of the considerations in the preceding part of this chapter have been opinion and experiment seeking to determine the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation for Type 1 diabetes in animal models. These animal models are perhaps more or less imperfect as true reflections of the human condition of Type 1 diabetes. It is therefore of critical relevance to review all data and experiences relating to the small number of human exposures to xenotransplanted porcine islets and other cells. Six patients were treated in 1995-6 with either encapsulated or unencapsulated neonatal porcine islets. One of these, a 41-yr-old Caucasian male with type 1 diabetes for 18 years was given an intraperitoneal transplant of alginate-encapsulated porcine islets at the dose of 15,000 islet equivalents (IEQs)/kg bodyweight (total dose 1,305,000 IEQs) via laparoscopy. By 12 weeks following the transplant, his insulin dose was significantly reduced by 30% (p = 0.0001). The insulin dose returned to the pre-transplant level at week 49. Improvement in glycaemic control continued as reflected by total glycated haemoglobin of 7.8% at 14 months from a pre-transplant level of 9.3%. Urinary porcine C-peptide, derived from the porcine pro-insulin precursor, peaked at 4 months (9.5 ng/ml) and remained detectable for 11 months (0.6 ng/ml). The patient was followed as part of a long-term microbiologic monitoring program which subsequently showed no evidence of porcine viral or retroviral infection. \n\nThe patient opted for elective laparoscopy 9.5 yr after transplantation. Abundant nodules were seen throughout the peritoneum. Biopsies of the nodules showed they contained capsules still protecting living cell clusters. Immunohistology noted sparse insulin and moderate glucagon staining cells. The retrieved capsules produced a small amount of insulin when placed in high glucose concentrations in vitro.",

Notably, Living Cell Technologies is currently conducting phase IIb trials for its alginate-encapsulated porcine islet product DIABECELL in New Zealand and Argentina. An attractive feature of xenogeneic islets is the potential for genetic engineering to remove or express transplantfriendly molecules on the target tissue. Such a strategy would focus on removal of the galactose sugar against which humans have natural antibodies, secretion and/or surface expression of immunomodulatory molecules, and interfering with other innate and adaptive immunity pathways.

            "text": "The increasing number of patients in need of organ transplants has made xenotransplantation of islets a potential future treatment option for diabetic patients due to the shortage of organ donors. According to recent advances in preclinical studies on non-human primates, porcine islets may be the ideal choice among various animal organs and tissues for xenotransplantation (147), mainly due to the biochemical compatibility of porcine and human insulin and the potential to obtain a large number of donor pigs through relatively short turnover breeding strategies. Additionally, another theoretical advantage of porcine islets is their potential resistance to autoimmune recurrence against human b-cells (148). The main barrier to interspecies transplantation is the preformed xenogeneic antibodies that cause hyperacute rejection. Hyperacute rejection (HAR) is a rapidly occurring rejection in islet transplantation and other organ transplants, usually occurring within minutes to hours after transplantation. This condition arises from the interaction between pre-existing antibodies from humans or non-human primates (NHP) and the antigens present in the graft (149).Among these antibodies, the most common are IgMs and IgGs that identify galactose-a1,3-galactose (a-Gal) residues, which are attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids by the a1,3 galactosyltransferase (a1,3GT) found in non-primate genomes. Humans and apes do not have a-Gal epitopes (150). Furthermore, approximately 70-90% of these antibodies specifically target a-Gal epitopes (151). As a result, when an organ from a pig is transplanted into a human or a non-human primate (NHP), the existing anti-Gal antibodies attach to the a-Gal epitopes found on the graft's vascular endothelium.",

Embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells combined with genome editing technologies are valuable tools to probe disease mechanisms, engineer in desired attributes such as safety switches and upon differentiation to use as potential replacement cell sources. Other potential cell sources are pigs, possibly with human pancreas. Such 'humanized' animals might also prove valuable for disease modeling, as will other genetically modified species. To accompany cell sources some form of immunoprotection will be required, such as retrievable planar, bead or fiber encapsulation devices. \n\nAs an alternative to using modified porcine organs, it is conceivable to combine gene knockouts in key developmental genes and interspecies chimeras to produce pigs with complementing human organs that can be harvested for transplant. As proof of concept for chimera complementation, Nakauchi et al. first created mice with rat pancreas 11 , and subsequently rats with mice pancreas 12 . These remarkable feats were achieved by injecting rat pluripotent stem cells into early-stage mouse embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, or mouse pluripotent stem cells into early-stage rat embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, islets isolated from rats with mouse pancreas were able to successfully reverse diabetes in recipient mice for >1 year, in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. These data provide compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of stem cell-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a xenogeneic host. As a next step towards the generation of pigs with human pancreas, knockout pig embryos were created with an apancreatic phenotype. Complementation of these embryos with allogenic blastomeres then created functioning pancreata in the vacant niches 13 . Ethical issues and regulations in Japan currently preclude testing the feasibility of reconstituting pancreas from human pluripotent stem cells in these animals.",

Thus, subcutaneous transplantation has been recommended as an alternative choice (van der Windt et al., 2008). \n\nAdult and neonatal pig islets xeno-transplanted in immunosuppressive nonhuman primates survived for more than 6 months (Cardona et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006). These reports are encouraging since porcine pancreatic xenograft can survive longer than other xenograft organs, suggesting the crucial clue in xenotransplantation. Several investigators alleged that xenotransplantaion of pig pancreatic primoria may be a candidate model as a therapeutics for both types 1 and 2 diabetes (Thomas et al., 1995;Rogers et al., 2006). Rogers et al. (2007) demonstrated that transplantation of embryonic day (E) 28 (E28) pig pancreatic primordia into the mesentery of STZdiabetic rhesus macaques reduced insulin requirement, suggesting the availability for diabetes. Although the report of porcine pancreatic islets xenograft into non-human primates was restricted to type I diabetes (van der Windt et al., 2009;Cooper and Casu, 2009), the usefulness in type II diabetes also remains to be attempted. Komoda et al. (2005) have demonstrated that islets from transgenic pigs expressing N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III showed prolonged survival after transplantation into cynomolgus monkeys.",

The first clinical islet xenotransplantation was performed by a Swedish team using fetal pancreatic tissue. Thereafter, clinical trials of islet xenotransplantation were conducted in New Zealand, Russia, Mexico, Argentina, and China using neonatal pig islets. In clinical trials, fetal or neonatal pancreata are used because of the established reliable islet isolation methods. These trials demonstrate the method\u2019s safety and efficacy. Currently, the limited number of source animal facilities is a problem in terms of promoting islet xenotransplantation. This limitation is due to the high cost of source animal facilities and the uncertain future of xenotransplantation. In the United States, the first xenogeneic heart transplantation has been performed, which could promote xenotransplantation. In Japan, to enhance xenotransplantation, the \u2018Medical Porcine Development Association\u2019 has been established.

            "text": "In 1994, CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in a T1D patient. This study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation but did not show improvement in the patient's condition (238). Over the following decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more thoroughly explored in preclinical trials with non-human primates (239,240). Humoral rejection is the main obstacle to the success of xenotransplantation. The a1,3Gal epitope, present on the surface of almost all animals except humans and some primates, is the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig-to-human and pig-to-non-human primate islet xenotransplantation. The University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. designed Gal knockout (GTKO) pigs that do not express Gal (158). This proved to be a significant milestone in the development of xenotransplantation. Although other xenogeneic antigens were later discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are considered a potential choice for eventual clinical translation. However, Gal knockout does not prevent islet rejection, and other genetic manipulations have been explored. In 2009, the Pittsburgh islet team first demonstrated long-term function (up to one year) of islet grafts in streptozotocin-induced diabetic non-human primates transplanted with porcine islets genetically modified to express human complement regulatory protein (hCD46). hCD46 expressed on porcine islets limited antibody-mediated rejection, allowing for the reduction of immunosuppression to maintain sufficient islet mass for long-term normal function. However, it did not reduce the initial islet loss associated with IBMIR as expected (241). This led to the further development of multigene pig islet donors capable of providing multifaceted protection to enhance islet transplantation. Five years later, the same group achieved similar success, long-term transplantation of islets from multigene pigs for the first time.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation using porcine pancreatic islets has the potential to alleviate donor shortages and to provide a nearly unlimited source of beta cells. Along with successful porcine islet isolation, the need for a site that can provide optimal revascularisation leading to adequate blood glucose control is essential for long-term success [1]. We have previously shown that fetal pig pancreatic fragments (FPPFs) transplanted under the kidney capsule where these kidneys were subsequently transplanted can effectively cure both renal failure and diabetes in a single transplant [1]. Xenotransplantation of a composite kidney/FPPF graft would have the significant advantages of only requiring a single transplant and giving time for the FPPFs to mature prior to transplantation [1].\n\nThese findings are extremely relevant to both neonatal and adult islet tissues as ultimately all islet tissue is calculated on the same basis of islet equivalence and so when transplanted ends up developing to provide the same functional mass and capacity regardless of the site into which it is transplanted.\n\nWe have compared outcomes for porcine islets transplanted into three sites: kidney, liver and spleen subcapsular spaces. Porcine islets transplanted beneath the kidney capsule performed well. Transplant of islets into the kidney subcapsule showed superior results for recipient blood glucose and insulin response compared with islets transplanted into the liver and spleen. The kidney subcapsular transplant site outcomes support the findings of our companion paper investigating mouse and human islets [8].\n\nThe choice of site for the transplant has an impact on both long-term outcome and short-term complications. While the kidney has advantages shown in this study and in [8], it is unlikely to be a viable clinical option due to the small subcapsular space available in the human kidney. Groth et al were the first to transplant fetal pig islets under the kidney capsule in humans in the clinical setting [10]. However, despite having biopsiable tissue, no graft had functional porcine C-peptide release. Nevertheless, Groth et al's study supports the potential application of composite islet/renal grafts wherein readily accessible extra islets could be co-transplanted with a kidney graft. Alternatively, the islets could be co-",

            "text": "Demonstrating consistent long-term survival and function of porcine islet xenografts in preclinical NHP models is a critical prerequisite for moving forward to the clinical translation of islet xenotransplantation (21,22). Here we report the outcome of a series of transplants of GM NICC in diabetic baboons. We used this model rather than macaques because of the closer similarity of baboons to humans in several characteristics including immune system and body temperature (9). However, baboons present specific challenges related to their size and high insulin demand; indeed, the basal daily exogenous insulin requirements post diabetes induction of the animals used in this study were almost twice those reported for macaques used in similar studies (7,8,23). This may help to explain the previously reported maximum survival of adult or neonatal porcine islets in baboons for only around 1 month (10-12), with normoglycemia for 1 day at most (10). Despite these challenges, we achieved, for the first time, successful long-term reversal of diabetes by transplantation of GTKO/CD55-CD59-HT NICC in five consecutive immunosuppressed baboons. Since we had previously shown that conventional clinically based immunosuppression was unable to prevent rejection of these GM NICC (12), we used a new protocol comprising our non-activating anti-CD2 mAb (17) to deplete T cells and NK cells, tacrolimus for the first 4 months, and costimulation blockade with belatacept and anti-CD154. Gao et al. recently reported that lymphocyte depletion with ATG promoted engraftment and survival of GM NICC xenografts in macaques (8). However, anti-CD2 has several potential advantages over ATG; it favours depletion of effector T cells (24) while sparing regulatory T cells (25,26), and avoids the adverse side effects of ATG (27). Anti-CD154 was included because of its demonstrated efficacy in NHP xenotransplantation (28).",

            "text": "This review has highlighted the challenges of the cellular immune response in islet xenotransplantation. Currently there is no immunosuppressive strategy that overcomes the dual challenges of efficacy and safety. This brings us back to the need to refocus on one of the major advantages of xenotransplantation; the opportunity to genetically modify the donor with the aim of minimising the treatment required for the recipient. Over the past two decades there have been considerable progress in developing a genetically modified pig islets that overcomes the dual problems of IBMIR and cell mediated rejection. This has been accelerated more recently by the generation of multi-transgenic pigs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This new generation of pigs have been designed to target simultaneously several components of the immune system. \n\nThey have yet to be formally tested in NHP models of islet xenotransplantation, although preliminary studies of porcine kidneys from these pigs transplanted into cynomologus monkeys have shown promising results (134). A new option for islet cell replacement has been reported recently. In February of 2022 ViaCyte/CRISPR announced in a press release that their first patient was treated in phase 1 trial of gene-edited islet cell replacement therapy for type1 diabetes, suggesting the development of gene-edited, stem cell-derived, \"hypoimmunogenic\" islet cell products as a promising alternative strategy for treatment of T1D. Whilst this sounds promising, formal evaluation of the trial results in the peer reviewed literature is awaited.

Immune rejection, physiological incompatibility and bio\u2010safety are the most critical issues. Methods To ensure the safety and efficacy of gene editing, second\u2010 and third\u2010generation sequencing technologies have allowed us to obtain a clearer genetic background of donor pigs for xenotransplantation. Based on the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, the local DPF\u2010 excluded lists and DPF donor facility were established in Changsha, China. A pig\u2010to\u2010human islet clinical trial was conducted and overseen by the respective Chinese governmental agency. Results The DPF standards for pig husbandry eliminated specific pathogens in donor pigs. We have established a PERV\u2010C free, genetic information clean, DPF donor for xenotransplantation. A clinical trial of ten adult patients (9M:1F) with type 1 diabetes who received DPF porcine islet xenotransplantation via the portal vein were performed. Clinical accepted immunosuppressant drugs and autologous Treg were used for controlling immune rejection. No cross\u2010species infection events occurred in this trial, and importantly, no cross\u2010species transmission of PERV was found. Conclusions Xenotransplantation is a pioneer study and safety is the most important issue. The fundamental principles for establishing xenotransplantation donor pigs should follow the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 (2008), the second WHO consultation,and the 2018 Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 which would finally help reducing the risks of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Background The transplantation of porcine islet cells provides a new potential therapy to treat patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Compared to other biomedical technologies, xenotransplantation stands out in terms of its involvement of animals as graft sources, as well as the possible transmission of infectious diseases. As these aspects are especially relevant for potential xenotransplantation recipients, it is important to assess their opinion regarding this technology, in particular in terms of the requirements that should be met in the informed consent process for xenotransplantation. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with seven T1DM patients to assess their information needs prior to xenotransplantation. Before the interview, the participants received a model informed consent form for a clinical trial with porcine islet cells transplantation. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results In the interviews, we identified several requirements that are crucial for patients with T1DM in order to consider xenotransplantation as a potential treatment option: therapy-related requirements, professional care and supervision, successful behaviour and attitude management, improving quality of life, and managing control/self-determination challenges. Regarding the informed consent form, several of the participants\u2019 questions remained open and should be addressed in more detail. The interviewees stressed the importance of personal consultations. Conclusions To become a sustainable therapeutic option, patients especially expected an improved diabetes control and a reduction of diabetes-related burdens. Health-related aspects prove to be pivotal for diabetic patients when considering porcine islet cell transplantation. The use of pigs as source for organ retrievals was not considered as problematic.",

            "text": "The object of allogeneic islet Tx is not that it should be the first therapeutic option for all. For many patients, exogenous insulin and tight metabolic control can be effective. However, for the many patients for whom islet Tx is the most effective option, including those with the most lifethreatening forms of T1D, it would be beneficial to be able to offer the procedure in the US. As demand increases, the supply of pancreata suitable for islet isolation may eventually become inadequate. Xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of porcine organs such as kidneys has long been considered as a possibility to overcome the limitations placed on organ Tx by insufficient human donors to accommodate demand. Research into xenoTx has primarily been driven by long waiting lists for kidney Tx that currently include over 90,000 individuals [100] and adds 40,000 annually [99]. \n\nLikewise, porcine islets have been considered as a replacement for human pancreas donors for islet Tx [101]. Physiological differences among species, and particularly immunological incompatibilities, have led to sophisticated measures to produce pigs more compatible to humans [102]. Dr. Thomas Starzl, often considered \"the father of modern transplantation\" showed early interest in xenoTx [103] and was a proponent of genetic engineering of pig donors. Several authors of this report were part of the group that was responsible for the breakthrough generation of the first \u03b11,3-Galactosyltransferase-deficient pigs [104] that represents the foundation of recent successful pre-clinical xenoTx. Our group has extensive experience in pig-tononhuman primate islet Tx models of diabetes [105][106][107]. We successfully demonstrated graft survival for a milestone of 1 year using genetically engineered pigs and repeated this success with multi-genetic pigs by adding various combinations of human transgenes [106,107]. A South Korean group has demonstrated graft survival >900 days using unmodified wild-type pigs [108]. These pre-clinical results, however, have been possible due to the use of clinically unavailable immunosuppression based on anti-CD154mAbs [109].",

Since the 1990s, researchers have attempted to use pigs as the source animal for xenotransplantation, and the pig is currently considered the most appropriate candidate species. Reasons for selecting the pig as a source animal include the pig's relatively large litter size and short maturation period, its size and physiological similarity to humans, the low risk of xenozoonosis, and the readily application of genetic engineering techniques to produce porcine organs that are resistant to rejection (7). However, the genetic discrepancy between pigs and humans has resulted in barriers for xenotransplantation, including immunological rejection, and risk of xenozoonosis. As with human allotransplants, xenotransplants are prone to immunological rejection. However, a vascularized porcine organ is more vigorously rejected in comparison with the current reaction observed in allotransplants because of the genetic distance between pigs and primates. Thanks to genetically modified pigs and immunosuppressive therapy, survival time results for xenografts have improved considerably in preclinical xenotransplantation models. These results in NHP models indicate that the use of xenotransplantation in clinical applications is approaching.\n\nIn this article, we (a) describe our understanding of immunological rejection responses in xenotransplantation, (b) summarize the genetically modified pigs used for xenotransplantation, and (c) report the current survival time of xenografts in pig-to-NHP models. On the basis of this considerable progress, we hold that clinical application of xenotransplantation will soon be a reality.",

            "text": "raft.\n\nIn parallel with developments in islet allotransplantation, scientists have also begun to experiment with porcine islets. Just over a century after Watson Williams attempted to transplant ovine pancreatic tissue, researchers have revived xenotransplantation as a possible therapy to cure diabetes and other conditions. Porcine islets have been sourced from fetal, neonatal and adult pigs. Source pigs may be wild-type or genetically modified. Pigs are an ideal source of islet cells because they are readily available, breed quickly, produce large litters and display insulin secretion patterns comparable to those found in humans (Liu and Harlan 2008). Porcine insulin was used to treat diabetics for many decades. The hyper-acute rejection of pig tissue may be ameliorated through cloning and genetic modification. Though pigs are generally the preferred source animal, researchers have also experimented with islet cells from other species including cows, rabbit and fish (Mihalicz et al. 2011). By comparison to non-human primates, pigs pose less disease risks and less ethical concerns since they are lower on the evolutionary scale (Boneva and Folks 2004).\n\nThe first islet xenotransplantation clinical trial was performed by Carl-Gustav Groth, the former Chief Physician of Transplant Surgery at Karolinska University Hospital, in Huddinge, Sweden. Though Groth first conceived of the idea in the mid-70s, it was not until the 1990s that he performed his clinical trial. Between 1990 and 1993, Groth treated ten participants with islet cells from porcine foetuses (Groth et al. 1994). The pig cells were either transplanted into the kidney capsule or infused into the intra-portal vein. A subsequent kidney biopsy identified viable islet cells and a related hormone called glucagon indicating insulin secretion. Though the trial did not lead to any reductions in the participant's insulin requirements, it did offer valuable preliminary data on graft function and indication of long term survival of porcine cells in the human body. Two years later, another team of Swedish scientist attempted to treat two dialysis patients with animal external therapy. Patient blood was circulated through pig kidneys for over an hour before it was returned to the patient's body (Hanson 2011).\n\nGroth's",

            "text": "Both renal insufficiency and diabetes were cured with kidneyfirst sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation. The baboon recipient maintained normal serum creatinine with no evidence of rejection for six months following kidney and islet transplant but was euthanized due to sepsis related to pyelonephritis in setting of stent occlusion on POD180. Immediately after islet transplantation, hyperglycemia was reversed with normalization of blood sugars from >250mg/dL (pre-transplant) to 80-110 mg/dL. Porcine islets functioned and maintained normal BG levels without any exogenous insulin treatment throughout the recipient's postoperative course. Post-mortem evaluation of liver confirmed presence of insulinstaining islets. \n\nDiscussion: timing of sequential transplants and immunomodulatory strategies may be important for success of islet-afterkidney xenotransplantation \n\nAs referenced above (see Preclinical progress in porcine islet xenotransplantation), investigators have recently achieved cure of diabetes in baboons using pooled islets from neonatal genetically modified pig donors (46). However, this required an average of 14 neonatal pancreases (70 piglets for 5 baboon recipients). In our model, we have achieved normoglycemia using islets derived from a single source adult pig with an administered islet mass of 12,500 IEQ/ kg. Of note, this is within range though slightly less than was required in the recent clinical islet-after-kidney transplantation studies where successful islet transplants averaged >16,000 IEQ/kg (2). \n\nOne reason for the success of free islet transplantation in this model may be timing of sequential transplants: kidney-first transplantation promotes absorption of anti-pig antibodies, likely reducing IBMIR following islet transplantation, corresponding to reduced loss of islets. This may have enabled durable reversal of diabetes with fewer islet equivalents as compared with clinical isletafter-kidney transplantation. Indeed, the possible antibody absorption benefits of sequential transplant timing is less clear in the clinical islet-after-kidney studies, where islet transplantation occurred well after index kidney transplantation.",

There has however, for a number of decades been a concerted effort to use various forms of por- cine \u03b2-cells as a replacement transplant alternative to cadaveric human donors. This has seen major advances in the last decade with significant development of multi-transgenic donor pigs that now can potentially be used for xenotransplantation. This has been achieved with cellular transplants leading the way using porcine islet cell transplants as a form of \u03b2 cell replacement in pre-clinical studies to treat diabetic non-human primates in various guises.

            "text": "The encouraging results recently reported by the Edmonton group in patients receiving allogeneic islet grafts, all of whom achieved at least temporary insulin-independence, has rekindled interest in transplantation of islets of Langerhans as a cure for diabetes [1, 2]. As successful clinical islet transplantation currently requires 2\u20134 human donors per recipient [1], the shortage of organ donors might prevent most eligible diabetic patients from receiving a graft. Currently, less than 100 cadaveric organ donors become available for clinical transplantation each year in Switzerland. In contrast, the population of type 1 diabetic patients is estimated at approximately 0.2% of the total Swiss population, i.e. around 14,000 persons. Unlimited islet transplants could be performed if a suitable tissue source was identified. Xenotransplantation of porcine islets is a potential solution to this shortage. Although in comparison to pigs, nonhuman primates are genetically closer to humans, but the pig remains the most suitable source of organs for humans due to a number of practical, safety, and ethical reasons [3]. With respect to the treatment of diabetes it is noteworthy that pig islets are known to be metabolically suitable, since pig insulin has for many years been used to treat diabetic patients; its structure differs from human insulin by only one amino acid residue. The implantation of xenogeneic tissue has provoked ethical and epidemiological controversies [4]. Balanced against the benefits of successful xenotransplantation is the possibility of transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) from porcine cells to the xenograft recipient, as infection of human cells has been demonstrated in vitro [5, 6]. However, neither PERV transmission nor clinical infection or disease have been observed in patients who have been exposed to living porcine tissues [7, 8]. The first clinical experience of porcine islet xenotransplantation into human patients was reported by the Swedish group headed by C. Groth in 1992 [9], several years before the identification of PERV. This surgical team transplanted a total of 10 diabetic patients with porcine islets. No reduction in insulin requirement was observed in any of these patients, but",

These  results are consistent with other studies indicating the efficacy of thalidomide treatment in preventing islet graft rejection, improving graft function and survival in the recipient [12]. \n\nCaprine islet grafts in the immunosuppressed group resulted in approximately similar non-fasting blood glucose levels as in the normal control mice which were near to glucose level in caprine (3.2-8.2 mM). As previously reported, islet xenotransplantation in diabetic animal models establishes normoglycemia in the recipients to the point that is normal for the donor instead of the recipient [31,32]. The results of this study showed that caprine islet grafts are capable of reversing diabetes and normalizing blood glucose levels in the recipient's body. \n\nThe IPGTT profiles revealed the glucose responsiveness of the caprine islet grafts, findings that are comparable to results obtained with islet cells recovered from other mammalian species including pigs, primates, and rodents [33][34][35][36][37][38]. In addition, caprine islets elicited an insulin response under both basal-and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from other mammals such as pigs, cows, and dogs, but less than those obtained with rodent islets [39]. Rodent islets secrete much more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, either basally or under glucose stimulation [40]. Caprine islet cells are efficient insulin-producing cells, similar to human and porcine islet cells, because they were able to maintain euglycemia and glucose  responsiveness in recipients.",

While these differences between outcomes of preclinical and clinical xenogeneic islet transplantation may be partly explained by differences in the immunosuppression regimens used in the clinical trialsnotably, CD40/CD40L costimulatory blockade, which has been critical to success in most preclinical studies, was not utilizedfurther trials have been limited by more recent consensus guidelines outlining an international framework to promote standardized clinical translation of pig-to-human islet transplantation from source pig development and manufacturing to patient monitoring (22). \n\nMoreover, in the many years since these clinical studies in islet xenotransplantation were conducted, the landscape of diabetes management has changed. Patients with diabetes have other options for durable disease management. Innovations in glucose monitoring and the rapid development of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery systems have improved quality of life for patients living with diabetes (23), and ongoing clinical trials of novel stem-cell derived islet cell therapy have published early and highly promising results (24). However, porcine islet xenotransplantation remains a compelling therapeutic possibility for patients with diabetic nephropathy who need both kidney and islet replacement. In these patients, there are minimal added risks associated with islet transplantation, as these patients are already on immunosuppression for their kidney grafts; in fact, islets may help protect against premature kidney graft loss associated with diabetes (25) as well as improve long-term vascular diabetic outcomes (26). Here, we will briefly highlight immunologic barriers in porcine islet transplantation, chronicle preclinical progress in the field, and summarize our own experience in combined islet and kidney transplantation, using both 1) vascularized islets in an islet-kidney composite graft, and 2) our more recent strategy of sequential kidney followed by islet xenotransplantation.",

Although stem-cell-derived organ and tissue regeneration have a potential to solve this as well for the future, it still remains as very early experimental phase. Likewise, artificial organs and mechanical devices have been simply used for bridge therapy to transplant. Therefore, xenotransplantation might provide the most imminent solution to the scarcity of human organ donors. In the last two decades, major progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of xenografts rejection, zoonotic infections including porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and production of genetically engineered pigs including \u03b11,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient pigs. With these elaborations, it is now on the threshold of first clinical application. Particularly promising first target is porcine pancreatic islet xenotransplantation. Graft survival has been prolonged to almost one year in the non-human primate study and is waiting for the development of relatively non-toxic or clinically applicable immunosuppressive or tolerance-inducing regimens. This review highlights the currently known obstacles to translate xenotransplantation into clinical therapies and the possible strategies to overcome these hurdles, as well as current status and future perspective for clinical xenotransplantaion.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation using porcine donors is rapidly approaching clinical applicability as an alternative therapy for treatment of many end-stage diseases including type 1 diabetes. Porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC) have normalised blood sugar levels for relatively short periods in the preclinical diabetic rhesus model but have met with limited success in the stringent baboon model. Here we report that NICC from genetically modified (GM) pigs deleted for \u03b1Gal and expressing the human complement regulators CD55 and CD59 can cure diabetes long-term in immunosuppressed baboons, with maximum graft survival exceeding 22 months. Five diabetic baboons were transplanted intraportally with 9,673 \u2013 56,913 islet equivalents (IEQ) per kg recipient weight. Immunosuppression consisted of T cell depletion with an anti-CD2 mAb, tacrolimus for the first 4 months, and maintenance with belatacept and anti-CD154; no anti-inflammatory treatment or cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis/treatment was given. This protocol was well tolerated, with all recipients maintaining or gaining weight. Recipients became insulin-independent at a mean of 87 \u00b1 43 days post-transplant and remained insulin-independent for 397 \u00b1 174 days. Maximum graft survival was 675 days. Liver biopsies showed functional islets staining for all islet endocrine components, with no evidence of the inflammatory blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) and minimal leukocytic infiltration. The costimulation blockade-based immunosuppressive protocol prevented an anti-pig antibody response in all recipients. In conclusion, we demonstrate that genetic modification of the donor pig enables attenuation of early islet xenograft injury, and in conjunction with judicious immunosuppression provides excellent long-term function and graft survival in the diabetic baboon model.",

            "text": "Studies on the negative effects of maternal diabetes on the health of human offspring show several limitations due to the number of co-occurring factors, such as the person's lifestyle and medical history. For example, most of the human studies include cases of maternal diabetes accompanied by other metabolic disorders, which makes it difficult to differentiate the consequences of diabetes from those of comorbidities. Therefore, animal models living under tightly controlled laboratory environments with the option of standardized tissue sampling [31] are necessary. So far, a variety of animal models have been generated to study GDM [32]. For instance, rodent models for GDM, generated by the usage of chemicals leading to \u03b2 cell loss, are widely used. However, rodent models frequently lack clinical relevance due to fundamental physiological differences from humans. Clinically more relevant, large animal models have the potential to bridge the gap between proof-of-concept studies and clinical trials (Figure 2). Non-human primate models have been used to study the developmental programming of diabetes and obesity [33]. Pigs are also attractive animal models due to their similarities with humans in anatomy and metabolism [34]. For diabetes, specific characteristics are particularly relevant (e.g., size and distribution of \u03b2 cells, similarity in insulin structure) that make the pig a valuable model for human glucose metabolism [35,36]. Importantly, despite structural differences between porcine and the human placenta (epitheliochorial vs. hemochorial), the transfer of glucose, amino acids, and partially fatty acids towards the fetus take place in both species [37].",

            "text": "The type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), also called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes, begins with insulin-producing beta cells attacked by autoimmune and subsequent deficiency of insulin, leading to increased glucose content in blood and urine 1 . Hyperglycemia caused by deficiency of insulin causes many complications in various tissues and organs, such as eyes, heart, blood vessels, and nerves 2 . Due to the absolute lack of endogenous insulin in T1DM, the continuous and indefinite supplement of exogenous insulin is indispensable. The main clinical treatment of diabetes mellitus includes insulin injection, oral hypoglycemic agents, combined with healthy life style, but these therapies often result in increased risk of disorder of glucose metabolism 3 . and hypoglycemia 4 . Other than exogenous substances, islet transplantation is a promising therapy for T1DM through regulating glycometabolism accordingly by blood glucose level of the organism 5 . \n\nRecently, clinical islet transplantation for diabetes has been focused on and it has achieved success as insulin independence rates up to five years after transplant, with minimal complications 6 . Islet transplantation shows lots of advantages on simple operation, low immunosuppression, and less complication 7 , exhibiting great potential in T1DM treatment. Nevertheless, the widely use of islet transplantation is largely hampered by immune rejection and short supply of donors, especially for islet allotransplantation 8 . Islet xenotransplantation from the porcine pancreata was performed for the first time 9 , which initiated the journey of islet xenotransplantation. A consensus statement was published by the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) in 2009 to undertake clinical trials of porcine islet products for T1DM treatment 10 , and it was updated recently 11 , forecasting the promising clinical application of islet xenotransplantation in the near future. Islet xenotransplantation can be an attractive alternative to overcome the problem of donor shortage, but still with barriers of immune rejection, in which immunosuppressive agents are urgently needed 12 .",

This protocol used anti-CD154 mAb which is not clinical available due to the side effects. Therefore, this protocol was not proceeded in clinical trials. \n\nSince anti-CD154 mAb is not clinically available, the Seoul group assessed anti-CD40 antibody-based immunosuppression despite anti-CD154 mAb, in the pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation model 24 . They conducted nine cases, and their immunosuppression protocol was described in Table 6. \n\nThe streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates received approximately 100,000 IEQ/kg islets in their portal veins. The nonhuman primates could maintain insulin free periods for 4 and 5 days in the first and second cases. The insulin free periods were prolonged for 25 and 8 days in the third and fourth cases. The insulin free periods were more than 60, 266, 10, 14, and 3 days in the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cases, respectively. They concluded that anti-CD40 mAb combined with tacrolimus was effective in prolonging porcine islet graft survival, but anti-CD40 mAb was not as effective as anti-CD154 mAb in terms of preventing early islet loss. \n\nThe Seoul group created a new immunosuppression protocol using clinically available immunosuppression 25 . The protocol is shown in Table 7. \n\nThey transplanted 55,600 to 102,000 IEQ/kg porcine islets into streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates (n = 7). The durations of normoglycemia with less than half doses of exogenous insulin were more than 200, 45, 194, 80, 210, 93, and more than 222 days.

            "text": "In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120). A similar 2016 clinical study in Argentina, where 8 patients underwent intraperitoneal transplantation with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets, also saw patients experiencing fewer episodes of unaware hypoglycemia and an improvement in HbA1c, but no change in daily insulin injections (121). Beyond ITx, recent thrilling advancements in clinical xenotransplantation highlighted the genetic modification approach. Two separate patients were transplanted with a genetically modified pig heart or kidney with 10 and 69 gene edits, respectively (122,123). Triumphantly, no acute rejection was seen with both procedures with the pig heart failing at 48 days and the pig kidney at just under two months after transplantation. These thrilling cases shed light on the possibility of a functional alternative organ source that may help fill the demand for organ transplantation. Exploring the clinical transplantation of islets from these genetically modified pigs may address the immunological barriers of xenotransplantation. As islet isolation disturbs the intricate vasculature perfusing islets, significantly lower exposure to xenogeneic antigens on donor endothelial cells would be expected in comparison to whole-organ transplants, where the whole-organ vasculature is derived from porcine. Despite the acute hypoxic conditions preceding angiogenesis as described, this process may ensure reduced exposure to additional donor tissue and reduce the risk of rejection. While the two pig-to-human heart and kidney transplant mechanism of rejection is still under investigation, we propose reducing exposure to xenogeneic endothelial cells may lead to more sustainable outcomes in xenogeneic ITx of these modified porcine strains. Moreover, the overall lower transplant mass in tandem with these genetic modifications may support more sustained long-term islet graft function. Examining their utility in clinical studies would serve as a confirmation.",

Moreover, life-long multiple immunosuppressive constitute a substantial limitation to the clinical application of islet xenoTx, providing a compelling rationale to pursue a clinically applicable strategy for the induction of tolerance. \n\nThe recent news from New York announcing kidney xenotransplantation in two brain death patients (14) and, subsequently, the world's first Tx of a genetically modified pig heart in a human patient has caught the public's attention (15). It is now timely to review and discuss the current status and potential of clinical islet xenoTx. \n\nIn the Research Topic entitled \"Xenotransplantation for the Therapy of Diabetes: A New Look\" we present four articles. Two of them focus on characterizing porcine islets and the other two introduce complementary or alternative strategies for islet replacement, such as via blastocyst complementation technology or human stem-cell-derived beta cells. \n\nThe article by Arefanian et al. from the University of Alberta assessed the yield, cell composition, and function of islets isolated from neonatal pigs at different ages. For previous experimental studies, two sources of pig islets have historically been used: neonatal pigs (16) or adult pigs (13,(17)(18)(19). It is generally accepted that adult pig islets are fragile and that their isolation is technically more challenging than human islet isolation; only a limited number of facilities are proficient in the provision of adult pig islets. Neonatal pig islet isolation is technically less complicated and therefore more broadly replicable. However, the islet yields are lower, thus, requiring multiple donors versus one adult to generate an islet mass sufficient to reverse diabetes in large mammals and potentially in human recipients. Neonatal islets compared to adult islets require a longer time to produce insulin following Tx (16). Thus, it is not yet clear whether to use neonate or adult pigs as islets donors and this decision, therefore, is subject to the individual institutions. Optimizing pig donor age for multi-organ retrieval for xenoTx poses a significant practical problem for companies seeking to raise pigs for xenotransplantation.",

The structural and physiological similarities between human and pig organs, along with its unlimited supply, have made them an excellent translational research model [25]. Insulin extracted from pig islets has been used for the treatment of diabetes for decades [10, 11, 20, 33]. Because porcine islets produce insulin patterns similar to those found in humans, and because they are readily available [20], studies strongly suggest that islets obtained from pigs could be a promising substitute for human islets in the treatment of T1D. Recent studies on genetically engineered pigs suggest that these pigs are more suitable for xenotransplantation. For example, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) pigs, have decreased the incidence of immunerejection and improved compatibility between the donor and recipient [31][32][33][34][35][36].\n\nThe major advantages for using pigs as an islet source for xenotransplantation are as follows:\n\n1. Ethically acceptable source.\n\n2. The pig pancreas has structural and physiological similarities to the human organ.\n\n3. Unlimited availability.\n\n4. Easy to breed and produce large litters.\n\n5. Rapid growth into adult organs (6 months).\n\n6. Significantly low cost of maintenance.\n\n7. Elective and emergent availability of the organs.\n\n8. Low risk of zoonosis.\n\n9. Facilities available to breed pigs under 'clean' conditions.\n\n10. Obviates 'cultural barriers' to human organ transplant (e.g. Japan); illegal organ trafficking; deleterious effects on organs in brain dead patients; living donor organ donation.\n\n11. Advanced and safe immunosuppression protocols.\n\n12. Cloning and genetic modification of cells to reduce immune destruction.\n\n13. Islet encapsulation to combat immune challenge.",

            "text": "Porcine islet xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes and a partial solution to the problem of human donor tissue shortage. Sources of porcine tissue include adult porcine islets, neonatal porcine pancreatic cell clusters (NPCCs) and fetal pig islet-like cell clusters (FP ICCs). Although adult porcine islets and NPCCs have been extensively studied in varied transplantation settings [1][2][3], FP ICCs have received less attention. As with NPCCs, FP ICCs are easily isolated [4], and are relatively resistant to hypoxia and attack by the proinflammatory cytokines that destroy adult b cells [5,6]. A disadvantage of using FP ICCs is the low proportion of mature insulin-producing b cells at the time of transplantation compared to adult pig islets. However, as with NPCCs, following transplantation, most of the primitive duct cells differentiate into insulin-producing b cells [4]. Preclinical studies from our group have shown that FP ICCs can normalize blood glucose levels (BGLs) of diabetic recipients both when transplanted beneath the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice [7] and when allografted into an immunosuppressed pig [8]. Human trials with FP ICCs implanted into immunosuppressed diabetic recipients conferred neither a confirmed functional benefit nor any adverse consequences with some cells staining positive for insulin [9,10]. One of the major problems facing the use of porcine islet tissue is the xenograft rejection by the host immune system and the need for chronic immunosuppression to prolong graft survival. \n\nEncapsulation of porcine tissue using alginate hydrogels has been widely used to overcome immune rejection and prevent the need for anti-rejection drugs [11].",

            "text": "Due to the similarity in body weight, anatomy, and physiology between pigs and humans, the pig has become a model for morphological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic investigations (1). \n\nThe anatomical and physiological similarities of organs such as the liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart have also made the pig a major species of interest as an organ donor for xenotransplantation procedures (2,3). Despite minor morphological differences, swine are the ideal species for liver xenotransplantation. Modern medical advances have enabled xenotransplantation of the liver from genetically modified pig donors. New medical techniques could make xenotransplantation an important method to solve the problem of providing livers from human donors (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). \n\nIt is well known that extrahepatic bile ducts are represented by the common hepatic duct (ductus hepaticus communis, DHC), the common bile duct (ductus choledochus, DCH), and the cystic duct (ductus cysticus, DC). The gallbladder (Vesica biliaris, VB) collects bile and releases it through the cystic duct into the common bile duct (8,9). \n\nConsidering the common origin of the pancreas and gallbladder together with extrahepatic bile ducts (10-12), it is important to know if the porcine biliary tract has endocrine cells producing insulin and glucagon which can contribute to the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes. Some authors like Dutton et al. (13) described a population of pancreatic-like endocrine cells which are localized in murine extrahepatic bile ducts. The insulin-positive cells were described as situated between cholangiocytes of bile ducts, but not between cholangiocytes of the gallbladder. They were defined as \u03b2-cells producing insulin (14). The common bile duct's ability to generate pancreatic cells is explained mainly by the common embryologic development of bile and pancreatic ducts (8,12,(14)(15)(16).",

            "text": "Table 1 reports a list of sites used in clinical islet transplantation. \n\nFurther on the frontiers of medicine are alternative methods to produce islets without relying on human organ donors, including techniques for the xenotransplantation of porcine islets. Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (68). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (69,70). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (71). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46).",

            "text": "The baboon response, both ex vivo and in vivo, appears to mirror that expected of human hosts. \n\nThe study of cellular xenotransplantation, such as porcine islet cell transplantation (Maki et al., 1996;Cozzi et al., 2000;Adams et al., 2001;B\u00fchler et al., 2002;Cantarovich et al., 2002), has been conducted using the baboon model. And, because they are readily available and because their immune response and adaptation to immunoregulation and antimicrobial therapy mimics that observed in humans, baboons have become a highly desirable model for the study of solid organ xenotransplantation. Baboons have been used as hosts for orthotopic and heterotopic heart, lung, liver, and kidney xenotransplantation. The vast majority of recent investigations involve baboon recipient survival and the characterization and manipulation of the primate immune response to organ transplants derived from commercially produced transgenic pigs. Thus far, baboon host and pig graft survivals have been measured in days or weeks. Most recent graft survival in a modified pig-toprimate model is about 60 days. These outcomes represent a technical, if not a clinically practical, victory. \n\nPig grafts, which are modified to express a human complement-regulatory molecule, are not hyperacutely rejected by primate hosts. However, delayed acute rejection has been a major impediment to graft and/or host survival. This so-called vascular rejection is clearly multifactorial and is the subject of much ongoing research. It is a powerful and lethal response against which chemical or genetic blockade has not yet been successful. Use of Gal knock-out porcine donors may further extend graft survival among primate recipients. Transplantation between highly divergent species, such as pig to primate, is clearly a tall mountain to climb in immunoregulatory terms. \n\nPerhaps less Himalayan and more Appalachian in metaphorical nature are the xenotransplants between species that are more similar, such as macaque to baboon, or baboon to human (as in the 1984 Loma Linda heart and the 1992 Pittsburgh liver clinical trials).",

            "text": "The shortage of human pancreas donor organs imposes severe restrictions on the use of allotransplantation to treat diabetes mellitus [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. When performed, whole pancreas transplantation requires use of potent immunosuppressive medications that have significant complications. Newer, more targeted immunosuppressive regimens that do not require steroids or high-dose calcineurin inhibitors make islet transplantation a more attractive option. However, side effects of immune suppression that must be maintained so long as the islet graft functions remain a source of morbidity and even mortality [15]. Thus transplantation therapy for diabetes trades one set of morbidities (associated with  diabetes and its medical treatment) for another (associated with immune suppression).\n\nThe severity of humoral rejection effectively precludes the use of pigs as whole pancreas organ donors for humans. However, because they are vascularized by the host posttransplantation, islets like other cell transplants are not subject to humoral rejection. Porcine islets are rejected within two weeks of transplantation in non-immune suppressed non-human primates [8,[16][17][18]. Experience Journal of Transplantation 5 with pig to primate islet or neonatal islet transplantation in immune suppressed non-human primates shows that sustained insulin independence can be achieved, but only through the use of agents that are not approved for human use or that result in a high level of morbidity and mortality [19][20][21]. Thus, the need for host immune suppression is a barrier for pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.\n\nXenotransplantation of embryonic pig pancreatic primordia in lieu of mature pig organs or porcine islets couples the wide availability of pig organs with the immunological advantages inherent in transplanting cellular embryonic tissue, circumventing humoral rejection and obviating the need for host immune suppression [1]. However, obtaining embryonic pig pancreata is technically challenging because surgery must be performed on multiple pregnant sows and isolation carried out from scores of embryos to obtain sufficient numbers of",

It also improves the quality of patients who present each year with organ failure. However, the transplanted organs are very insufficiency owing to the overwhelming demands for donated organs. Xenotransplantation may be one of the best possible approaches to solving the severe shortage of human donors, which greatly limits progress in clinical transplantation. Therefore, xenotransplantation is currently a hot topic in bio-organ of biomedical research. Among many species, pigs are suitable animals due to easier animal husbandry, comparatively similar anatomical and physiological similarities to human organs (Hughes, 1986;Pereira-Sampaio et al, 2004;Vodicka et al, 2005). These reports suggest that pigs can be used as alternative to the shortage of human organs, if we produce appropriate and optimal pig strain without immune response to human (Vodicka et al, 2005;Puga Yung et al, 2009). However, many crucial answers on efficacy and safety will ultimately only be solved by well designed and controlled solid organ xenotransplantation trials on humans. Therefore, further research on the potential effects of crossing the species barrier in pig-to-primate model is essential before clinical application is acceptable (Ravelingien et al., 2004;Ekser et al., 2009). This review article provides an overview of the rejection in pig xenotransplantation to primates, and genetically modified and clonged pig in xenotransplantation. It also highlights major target organs in porcine xenotransplantation and virus infection in xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "\u00a9 2014 Bottino et al. Diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. Type 1 diabetes can be treated successfully by islet allotransplantation, the results of which are steadily improving. However, the number of islets that can be obtained from deceased human donors will never be sufficient to cure more than a very small percentage of patients who might benefit from transplantation. Although there are some differences in glucose metabolism between pigs and humans, the use of pigs could provide an unlimited supply of islets, and the insulin produced would undoubtedly control glucose levels. Transplantation of islets into the portal vein results in islets residing in the liver; however, an early inflammatory response and rejection remain problematic, even when the recipient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. In the long term, immunosuppressive drugs may exhibit toxicities to patients and specifically harm the islet cells. In contrast, encapsulation techniques provide islets with a physical barrier that prevents antibodies binding to the islet graft while still allowing insulin to be released into the recipient\u2019s circulation; in theory, patients receiving encapsulated grafts might not require exogenous immunosuppressive therapy. Nonhuman primates with encapsulated pig islet transplants have remained insulin-independent for several weeks, but long-term efficacy remains uncertain. Furthermore, techniques are now available to knock out genes from the pig and/or insert human genes, thus rendering the antigenic structure of pigs closer to that of humans, and providing protection from the human immune response. Islet transplantation from genetically engineered pigs has been followed by insulin independence in a small number of nonhuman primates for greater than 1 year. Neonatal islets have some advantages over adult islets in that they are easier to isolate and culture, and have the ability to proliferate during the first few months after transplantation. In 2009, the International Xenotransplantation Association set up a group to encourage and advise on clinical trials of pig islet xenotransplantation; this group\u2019s guidelines are discussed. Clinical trials of encapsulated pig islets are already under way.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes has been treated successfully by transplanting islets of Langerhans, the endocrine tissue that releases insulin [1] . Despite the clinical efficacy of islet transplantation, serious issues preclude its broad clinical application, including the side effects of chronic immunosuppressive regimens and a shortage of human donors. For example, it was recently estimated that only one pancreas is available per 333 patients with type 1 diabetes in the United States [2] . This situation is aggravated by the need of each recipient undergoing transplantation for 2-4 pancreases [1,3] . This shortage of pancreas donors therefore justifies the search for alternative sources of insulin-producing cells. Swine appear to be the major candidates for islet procurement because: (1) humans have been treated with porcine insulin for > 40 years (pig and human insulin differ by only one amino acid); \n\n(2) pigs have large litters with offspring that rapidly attain adult size and are therefore amenable to genetic engineering; (3) pig pancreases contain large islets that respond to glucose stimulation; and (4) since pigs are widely bred and slaughtered for food, the use of their islets to restore human health may be an option that could satisfy sociocultural and ethical concerns [4][5][6] . \n\nUnlike primarily vascularized organs, pancreatic islets are implanted without direct connection to the host vascular network, with 7 to 14 d needed to re-establish blood flow [7][8][9][10][11][12] . Thus, it was thought that pig islet xenografts could escape typical hyperacute rejection and acute vascular rejection [13] . In vivo, however, pig islets in nonimmunosuppressed nonhuman primates are rejected by both humoral and cellular immune reactions [14][15][16] . Diffuse, presumably nonspecific IgG deposits were observed within islet-associated accumulations of platelets 12 h after transplantation. Deposits of large amounts of IgM and moderate to large amounts of C3, C5, and C9 were present on islet surfaces 2 to 3 d after xenografting [15][16][17] .",

            "text": "It is theoretically feasible to use a porcine genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (PigGeCKO) library to identify novel antigens in xenotransplantation. \n\nFrom the recent first-ever life-saving cardiac xenotransplantation, patients died of multiple organ failure, and organ grafts died from porcine virus infection (Kuehn, 2022). Therefore, with the hope of the eventual implementation of clinical cardiac xenotransplantation, we think it is important to eliminate porcine virus infections to prolong the lifespan of these clinical grafts. The molecular mechanisms associated with rejection involved in pig liver xenotransplantation are more complex than those in cardiac xenotransplantation (Lu et al., 2019). Thrombotic microangiopathy and systemic consumptive coagulopathy are more severe in grafts after liver xenotransplantation than in xenotransplantations of other organs (Zhou et al., 2022). Therefore, addressing thrombotic microangiopathy and systemic consumptive coagulopathy remains a priority for breakthroughs in liver xenotransplantation. In the field of kidney xenotransplantation, which has recently been performed successfully in a brain-dead patient, NYU porcine kidney transplantation is just the beginning. More clinical data are still needed, and the next step may be to initiate a pig kidney transplant trial in patients with end-stage renal failure. More clinical organ xenotransplantation may begin within a few years, with clinical kidney xenotransplantation going first. This is because in the event of a failed transplant, patients could also be put back on dialysis to stay alive (Porrett et al., 2022). In islet xenotransplantation, a current hot spot is the use of cell encapsulation techniques to protect islets from host immune rejection during the initial stages of transplantation. Additionally, there are now some groups trying to transplant porcine islets into different recipient sites (Zhou et al., 2022).",

This surgical team transplanted a total of 10 diabetic patients with porcine islets. No reduction in insulin requirement was observed in any of these patients, but porcine C-peptide could be detected [10]. The results of this trial indicated that some xenogeneic islet cells were not acutely rejected in these patients receiving standard pharmacologic immunosuppressive therapy. More recently, a new clinical trial of islet xenotransplantation has been initiated in Mexico by Valdes et al. [11]. Several patients have been transplanted with a combination of porcine islets and Sertoli cells. This trial has provoked skepticism in the scientific community, as it is performed in a country that has no legal regulatory conditions on xenotransplantation and that no pre-clinical animal experiments have been performed [12]. It should therefore be mandatory to perform experiments in relevant pre-clinical models before initiating new clinical trials. As the risk of pig-to-human viral transmission is not yet established or excluded, experiments in large animal models will allow to estimate if this risk is acceptable for the initiation of new clinical trials.",

This convergence of experimental therapies in the preclinical setting presents a predicament when considering clinical xenotransplantation trials [31]. It is as yet uncertain whether conventional immunosuppressive agents may be effective enough to facilitate engraftment and maintenance  of genetically modified (\"humanized\") porcine organs or tissues. Furthermore, many of the immunosuppressive agents currently being tested in nonhuman primate models are not yet approved for clinical use. More rigorous testing of novel genetically modified pigs with minimal and/or more clinically relevant immunosuppression is warranted. However, the potential of costimulation blockade in xenotransplantation holds great promise for future use. Although genome-edited pig xenografts will certainly minimize the need for novel immunosuppressive agents, the increasing depth of our costimulation blockade library will benefit the future of allotransplantation and xenotransplantation alike.",

The pig may potentially be an unlimited source of organs for patients with diabetes, although the appropriate age for islet isolation is not known. As juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, we analyzed the distribution of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development to propose an appropriate age cut-off for islet isolation from the juvenile porcine pancreas [43] . We found that the isolation of porcine pancreatic islets approximately 35 d after birth may offer benefits with regard to their xenotransplantation potential.

Endotoxin level was measured in islet cell lysate after isolation. Both Nordmark and Roche enzyme resulted in significantly lower endotoxin level compared to Collagenase P, meeting the criteria of <30 EU/mL diabetic patient and could have an equivalent level of function as reported for human islets.

Old World non-human primates, due to their high immunological similarity to humans, are commonly used as surrogates in experimental xenotransplantation model. The most important achievements in preclinical xenotransplantation studies are presented below. Genetically modified pig kidney has the potential to be the first clinically applied pig-to-human organ transplants [127]. In recent years, significant progress has been made towards extending the survival time of life-supporting porcine kidney xenografts in non-human primates, with the longest survival time being 499 days [128]. The authors used kidneys derived from genetically modified pigs with knock-out of porcine GGTA1 gene and knock-in of human CD55 gene, and applied immunosuppression included a transient pan-T cell depletion and an anti-CD154-based regimen combined with daily mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and solumedrol. The studies suggested that CD4+ T cell depletion may play a crucial role in the long-term survival. For cardiac xenotransplantation, the results are even more promising. Heterotopic hearts from multimodified pigs with knock-out of porcine GGTA1 and knock-in of human CD46 and TM, combined with anti-CD40 antibody based treatment, survived up to 945 days in the baboon [118]. Exploiting the same genetic background and immunosuppression regimen, orthotopic cardiac xenotransplantation was performed with a maximum survival of 195 days [83]. Porcine liver and lung xenotransplantations are more problematic than porcine kidney and heart due to severe coagulation dysregulation. Orthotopic liver from pigs with knock-out of porcine GGTA1 and under immunosuppressive therapy and exogenous human coagulation factors survived for 29 days in the baboon [129].",

Compared to other biomedical technologies, xenotransplantation stands out in terms of its involvement of animals as graft sources, as well as the possible transmission of infectious diseases. As these aspects are especially relevant for potential xenotransplantation recipients, it is important to assess their opinion regarding this technology, in particular in terms of the requirements that should be met in the informed consent process for xenotransplantation. We conducted qualitative interviews with seven T1DM patients to assess their information needs prior to xenotransplantation. Before the interview, the participants received a model informed consent form for a clinical trial with porcine islet cells transplantation. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis. In the interviews, we identified several requirements that are crucial for patients with T1DM in order to consider xenotransplantation as a potential treatment option: therapy-related requirements, professional care and supervision, successful behaviour and attitude management, improving quality of life, and managing control/self-determination challenges. Regarding the informed consent form, several of the participants\u2019 questions remained open and should be addressed in more detail. The interviewees stressed the importance of personal consultations. To become a sustainable therapeutic option, patients especially expected an improved diabetes control and a reduction of diabetes-related burdens. Health-related aspects prove to be pivotal for diabetic patients when considering porcine islet cell transplantation. The use of pigs as source for organ retrievals was not considered as problematic.",

The first concept, that whole animal organs were anticipated to serve as spare-part replacements for failed human organs, was driven by the inability of the supply of human organs to keep pace with the ability of technological advances in transplantation to save lives. Increasingly since 1990, the development of xenotransplantation applications has been influenced by the recognition that unique properties of therapeutic materials originating from nonhuman species may be exploited to the advantage of human health. Increasingly, the products are cellular rather than whole organs. Problems with immune rejection and the absence of preclinical data meeting specific recommendations for the survival of xenogeneic organs in nonhuman primates prior to clinical use in humans further influence preferential interest in cellular transplantation versus organ transplantation. Recent success with islet allotransplantation for diabetes is driving renewed interest in using porcine islets because of a lack of a sufficient supply of human islets for allotransplantation. The transplantation of cellular products likely represents the most viable near future of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Recently, our group reported successful results where five consecutive diabetic monkeys achieved normoglycemia for at least 6 months after transplantation of adult porcine islets, with the longest survival day reaching to >603 days [26]. During a follow-up study, one monkey showed normoglycemia up to ~1000 days using a CD40-CD154 blockade such as anti-CD154 or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody [27]. These two studies pose an important implication that porcine islet graft can survive in the liver, which is rather a harsh environment, for a significantly long duration. The caveat of these studies would be transplanting relatively high numbers of islets (100,000 IEQ/kg) to maintain normoglycemia for a long duration, which would reflect the species incompatibility between NHP and pig. The normal fasting blood glucose level (BGL) of a monkey has been known to be around 60 mg/ dL, and the monkey requires higher amount of insulin for glycemic control than pigs and probably humans [28]. As rhesus monkeys have about 25-year lifespan, 1000 days could approximate to 3000 days (>8 years) in humans, suggesting that transplanted porcine islets can treat diabetic patients for a long time, given that immunosuppression should be well maintained with suitable drugs. Currently, our group is actively seeking to develop clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimen in the same pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation model. \n\nIn this chapter, we will describe the detailed procedures of islet isolation from adult SNU miniature pigs, diabetes induction and islet transplantation, immune monitoring after transplantation, and finally biopsy and subsequent immunohistochemical analyses. Because other related topics including encapsulated pig islets, islet sources, immunosuppression regimen, and overall results from several pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation have been elegantly described elsewhere [15,[29][30][31][32], here we will focus on the above themes while briefly reviewing past and current status of each area.",

Xenotransplantation using pig organs/tissues repre-sents a potential solution for this shortage; however, it has been hampered by a number of mainly immuno-logical hurdles. Remarkable progress was presented at the latest biennial (13th) international congress of the International Xenotransplantation Association, November 2015 in Melbourne, Australia, and the American Transplant Congress, May 2016 in Boston, USA. Most importantly, the survival records of pig organ xenografts in nonhuman primate models have strikingly improved with the use of multitransgenic pigs. Moreover, no safety issues were encountered in clinical trials with porcine islets, and the removal of porcine endogenous retroviruses from the genome of a pig cell line by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers the perspective to overcome the perceived potential risk of xenozoonosis in the near future. For all these reasons, interest in xenotransplantation has been boosted. This review summarises the current status of xenotransplantation research, including Swiss contri-butions as well as regulatory and safety aspects in the light of upcoming clinical trials.",

To alleviate the scarcity of donors, islet xenotransplantation offers exciting prospects. The first reported attempt to transplant porcine islets into human patients of T1D was carried out in 1994. 59 Results demonstrated detectable C-peptide levels in patient urine for up to 300 days after transplant. However, these were without significant effects on blood glucose levels. 59 Since then, there have been small clinical studies, which reported benefits of using pig-derived islets for the treatment of T1D. 60,61 These studies provided strong clinical benefits for treating T1D. However, a number of challenges limit the clinical implementation of this approach, including a reliable source of pig islets, developing strategy for immune isolation of xeno-islets, and identifying suitable sites for transplantation.\n\nPreclinical studies have reported additional benefits of using neonatal porcine islet-like cell pancreatic cell clusters (NPCCs) as opposed to mature islets. This includes robust survival during pre-transplant islet isolation procedures, especially in the ischaemic ex vivo environment. 62 In addition, after transplant, the encapsulated NPCCs are reported to proliferate and differentiate into mature \u03b2 cells, providing robust glucose control. 62 Unlike mature islet cells, NPCCs are also resistant to cytotoxic effects of the host pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). 63 Regarding potential zoonosis from porcine graft, there are variety of designated pathogen-free pig breeds available, including the Chicago Medical School miniature pigs, New Zealand Auckland Island pigs, and transgenic pigs targeting porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). 62 There are also studies, which have demonstrated stable glycaemic control using transplantation of genetically modified xeno-islet grafts. For instance, islets genetically altered to overexpress anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 have been transplanted and demonstrate stable functional profile with minimal",

Subsequently, we reported similar, albeit less robust, outcomes using an anti-CD40 mAb (2C10R4) [28], which has potential for clinical use. Most recently, we maintained normal glycemic control in three of seven diabetic NHPs and significantly reduced the need for exogenous insulin in five of these seven animals. This was achieved using a clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimen that included ATG, adalimumab, anakinra, tocilizumab, intravenous im-munoglobulin, tacrolimus, belimumab, rapamycin, and tofacitinib [29]. While this study could substantially advance the area of islet xenotransplantation clinical trials, the intensity of the immunosuppressive protocol used limits its widespread application. Consequently, additional strategies may be necessary, such as employing genetically engineered pigs or developing novel immunosuppressive drugs with fewer adverse effects.",

            "text": "In collaboration with the World Health Organization, the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) published a consensus statement in 2009 to guide the safe conduct of clinical trials involving porcine islet cells. This guidance is detailed in \"The International Xenotransplantation Association consensus statement on the conditions for undertaking clinical trials of porcine islet products in type 1 diabetes.\" One obstacle to the clinical adoption of porcine islet xenotransplantation is the difficulty in meeting success criteria in preclinical studies involving nonhuman primates (NHPs) [25]. The updated IXA consensus statement from 2016 specify requirements for NHP studies. These include maintaining fasting blood glucose levels below 150 mg/dL and nonfasting levels below 200 mg/dL, either without the need for exogenous insulin or with a significant reduction in insulin requirements, in at least four of six consecutive NHPs following porcine islet transplantation with a clinically available immunosuppressive regimen [26]. Also, all cases should have a follow-up period of at least 6 months, with one or Various research teams have conducted studies on porcine islet xenotransplantation in preclinical NHP models to adhere to the IXA guidelines. Among these efforts, the present article summarizes the results of groups that achieved long-term graft survival (Table 3) [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]. In 2015, our group was the first to demonstrate a proof of concept by successfully reversing diabetes in five diabetic NHPs. This was accomplished through the transplantation of wild-type porcine islets, combined with an immunosuppressive regimen that included an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 5C8)-which is not considered clinically applicable-and low-dose sirolimus, with or without ex vivo expanded Treg cells [27].",

Islet xenotransplantation using porcine islets is drawing attention as a means to overcome the donor shortage. In clinical trials involving the transplantation of neonatal porcine islets into diabetic patients in Sweden, serum porcine C-peptide was detected and graft survival was confirmed. 4 Furthermore, in clinical trials in New Zealand and Argentina, the glycemic control of patients with T1D improved after they were transplanted with alginate microcapsules encapsulating neonatal porcine islets. 5,6 igs are an advantageous source for islet cells because they have high fertility and because a large amount of islets can be acquired at low cost. In addition, in contrast to human cadaver donors, there would be minimal damage to the tissue due to ischemia or lethal diseases, and quality-controlled and fresh MOTIVATION A shortage of donors and the need for immunosuppressants are major issues of islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therefore, we are developing T1D treatment using xenogeneic islets and bioartificial pancreas (BAP). However, no BAP devices currently meet all of the functions of long-term glycemic control, islet survival, immunoprotection, discordant xenotransplantation feasibility, and biocompatibility. To address this, we developed a hydrogel with long-term stability and permeability for encapsulating islets in this study. Furthermore, we found an immunoprotective membrane with high biocompatibility for wrapping xenogeneic islets and used them to develop BAP devices. \n\norgans and cells can be obtained. There is no concern about tumorigenicity, which is a problem with embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem-derived cells. 7 In addition, pigto-human infectious diseases can be controlled by using pathogen-free pigs.",

Furthermore, the recent progress of porcine organ graft survival in nonhuman primates may spur the possibility of successful xenotransplantation [96] . Pigs have been considered a source of islet replacement therapy for T1DM for many years [97] . In 1994, in a first-in-human trial, Groth et al [98] transplanted fetal pig islets encased within the human kidney capsule into T1DM patients. The study was remarkable as porcine C-peptide was detectable for more than 300 d, without any observable serious side effects, although there was no insulin independence or reduction in exogenous insulin requirement. Encapsulated pig islets, branded as Diabecell \u00ae , to treat patients with unstable T1DM have undergone clinical trials in New Zealand and Argentina, and encouraging preliminary results indicate correction of hypoglycemic unawareness and improved a modest reduction in the hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. However, detectable porcine C-peptide was strikingly absent in these subjects [99][100][101][102][103] .",

The establishment of an efficient system for the production of designated pathogen-free (DPF) pigs is a prerequisite for the clinical application of xeno-islet transplantation therapy. Therefore, we developed a feasible and economic method that consists of uterectomy of a full-term sow, recovery of fetuses from the uterus, and rearing of neonatal piglets under aseptic conditions in specially designed isolator units. Full-term sows were subjected to a midventral incision under general anesthesia. Each excised uterus was transferred to the recovery unit through a disinfecting tube, and the fetuses were recovered from the uterus. The piglets thus recovered were then transferred to the second isolator unit for artificial nursing with a \u03b3-irradiated milk substitute. Swab samples of the body surface of the pigs and the internal surface of the rearing unit were collected weekly to test the sterility of the piglets. The samples were examined using a standard protocol that was developed and recommended by the Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science. At the end of the rearing period, the blood and internal organs, including the pancreas, were collected to analyze sterility and the presence of viruses. The average recovery rate of live piglets was 93.3%. The body weight of the neonatal piglets did not differ significantly from that of the control piglets that were obtained via natural farrowing. Blood and tissue samples obtained from the piglets after the rearing period tested negative for bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Of the viruses currently designated in the guideline for xenotransplantation by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 58 were proven to be absent based on the results of negative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The uterectomyisolated rearing method has potential applicability for the practical production of donors using neonatal piglets for xeno-islet transplantation [78] .",

First, the regulatory framework established by national health authorities (including but not limited to the US FDA and European Medicines Evaluation Agency) and the recommendations made by International Xenotransplantation Association and the World Health Organization provide a safe and suitable framework for conducting clinical trials of investigational porcine islet products in T1D. Second, a surveillance and safety program has been developed to detect, measure, manage, report, and respond to infectious diseases caused by known infectious agents and, possibly, previously unknown or unexpected pathogens in individual recipients of pig tissues. Finally, suitable, designated pathogen-free, WT source pigs have been generated for planned pilot clinical trials. However, other key requirements remain to be met, including first and foremost the development of a safe and consistently effective rejection prophylaxis and the development of a commercially viable porcine islet product. Accordingly, the significance of islet xenotransplantation in the care of patients with diabetes in the next 10 years will be determined by progress made in these 2 areas. Equally important in the determination of the future significance of islet xenotransplantation will be the progress made in the development of the AP and stem cell-derived sources of islet cells.",

(4) Other inconveniences are the high cost of islet isolation, the poor durability of insulin independence, autoimmunity and rejection after transplantation (2,3,5,6). \n\nTo supply the scarcity of islets, animal donors, such as pigs, could provide an alternative source of cells for transplantation (7). However, xenotransplantation is challenged by the possible risk of infection from pathogens within the donor animal. Specifically, all pigs contain multiple copies of porcine endogenous retrovirus and at least three variants of pig endogenous retrovirus (PERV), which can infect human cells in vitro. Thus, there is a risk of PERV infection associated with the xenotransplantation of pig islets to immunosuppressed human patients (8,9). \n\nIn this context, to evaluate the quality and function of isolated human islets (10), the rodent has been chosen over other animals in most studies that involve islet rejection and the prevention of type 1 diabetes (3). \n\nManikandan et al. (11) studied the antioxidant effect of black tea on the regeneration of pancreatic -cells and observed a positive therapeutic effect in rodent studies. Recently, Gu et al. (12) described an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat type 1 diabetes, namely, treatment by nanoparticles, which sustainably promotes the self-regulation of glucosemediated insulin secretion. This effect is observed for a longer period of time than the insulin injections that are currently used for treatment. \n\nAlthough there have been many positive results related to the xenotransplantation of human islets to rodents, researchers have rarely achieved a breakthrough in the clinical treatment of islet transplantation, perhaps because of the differences between the human immune system and the rodent model. These differences have stimulated the development of humanized rodent models, which allow the detailed study of human immune system cells and transplanted human islets in vivo (3).",

            "text": "Cell replacement therapies represent innovative alternative treatments offering the promise of long-lasting restoration or amelioration of disrupted cellular functions rather than temporary alleviation of clinical symptoms necessitating life-long medication. Patients suffering from degenerative and autoimmune diseases could benefit from such treatments. In particular, pancreatic islet allotransplantation for the treatment of type I diabetes became a clinical reality thanks to great advances in islet isolation and preservation and to less aggressive immunosuppression. Transplantation of other cell types such as hepatocytes, bone marrow, or umbilical cord stem cells is also used in the clinic today while neural cell transplantation which could represent a significant step forward in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders is still in an early development stage. However, and regardless of tissue-specific considerations and difficulties, a common major obstacle standing in the way of wide-spread use of cell transplantation is the lack of human donors, therefore opening the door for the use of alternative sources of cells from other species. In this context, pigs emerged as suitable candidates for providing xenocells due to anatomical and physiological similarities with humans. The possibility of genetically modifying donor pigs to mitigate the host immune reaction to xenografted cells and to adapt their function to human physiology when needed will definitely accelerate the transition of cell xenotransplantation from the bench to the clinic.",

            "text": "Recently, Hogrebe et al. 20 introduced a highly efficient iPSC differentiation protocol by targeting the cytoskeleton with latrunculin A (29.1% of NKX6.1 + Cpeptide + ). These results encourage the use of iPSCs-derived blike cells in future diabetes treatment. Further research should be followed to prove their benefits in clinical application. \n\nXenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted 21 . In addition, PERV, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and other microorganisms are potential sources of zoonosis that should be considered as well. Recently, a genetically engineered porcine heart was transplanted to a 57 year old man. The recipient survived 2 months after surgery and the medical team recently reported that the patient had been infected with porcine cytomegalovirus 22 . Thus, zoonosis is still an important issue in xenotransplantation. For this reason, the current International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) guideline recommends the use of PERV-C negative pigs nurtured at a designated pathogen-free facility 23 . In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24 .",

            "text": "Kidney transplantation, the best treatment for end-stage renal disease, is limited by the shortage of human donors. Although the donor pool has been expanded by strategies such as paired donation and the use of blood group-incompatible and non-heart-beating donors, it remains unlikely to meet the increasing demand in the foreseeable future. This has driven a search for alternative sources of donor kidneys. Much recent activity has focused on the generation of transplantable tissue from autologous stem cells, but the complexity of the kidney makes this a long-term prospect at best (1). In contrast, xenotransplantation using pigs as donors has been studied for several decades (2,3), and porcine cellular xenografts have already reached the stage of clinical trials (4). The pig is the animal donor of choice for a number of reasons including relatively similar organ size and physiology, high reproductive capacity, and the potential for genetic modification to prevent rejection and correct molecular incompatibilities. Preclinical studies indicate that pig kidney xenotransplantation is feasible, with renal xenografts supporting life for several weeks or months in non-human primate recipients (5)(6)(7)(8). However, despite considerable progress in recent years, the immunological and pathophysiological barriers have not been completely overcome. The major challenge is to place renal xenografts on at least an equal footing with allografts i.e. with comparable survival rates under similar levels of immunosuppression. This is likely to require a combination of 'humanized' donors and clinically applicable immunosuppressive protocols. Herein we will review the mechanisms of porcine renal xenograft rejection and describe recent progress in moving kidney xenotransplantation to the clinic.",

            "text": "PT and IT limits have sparked research for alternative sources of beta cells, potentially unlimited, and without the need for immunosuppression. Xenotransplantation represents a possible solution to the donor shortage and recent research in genetic modification and immunosuppressive regimens have increased interest in this area. Until now small clinical studies have considered this possibility, especially using pigs beta cells. Major barriers to xenotransplantation are represented by an instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, chronic rejection, and the risk of transmission of porcine infectious diseases. To overcome the risk of acute rejection, related to different cell surface epitopes between humans and donor, genetically modified Xeno islet have been created, using gene-editing techniques to alter proteins in cells surface. As demonstrated for human beta cell transplantation, encapsulation could protect also Xeno islet from immune attack. There are persistent barriers to xenotransplantation and further data are necessary to establish an ideal genetically modified porcine islet to evaluate the possibility of clinical studies [156]. \n\nFuture strategies for beta-cell replacements are based on stem cell (SC) to create insulin-producing cells (IPC) from SC [157][158][159][160][161]. The first problem to solve is the source of IPC: these cells could be produced from a stem cell-derived from human embryonic cells (EC) [162] or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) [163]. EC are pluripotent cells derived from the blastocyst that can proliferate indefinitely, and differentiate in different tissues. At variance, IPSC is derived from adult mature tissue, and is re-programmed by appropriate stimuli to pluripotent cells [164]. These types of stem cells are similar in pluripotent capacity, and have the potential to create IPC: however, there are significant ethical issues in using EC so that the main source of stem cells can be considered the IPSC. Pivotal studies in this field reported insulin-producing cells obtained either by EC or IPCS but their generation rate was low and with a poor secretory response to high glucose, probably due to the low differentiation efficiency of protocols employed [165][166][167].",

Technological developments like gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 potentially eliminate endogenous viruses in pigs, improving porcine islet xenotransplantation safety to humans (31).Gene editing overexpresses or knocks out multiple genes finding the best transgenic pigs for islet transplantation, avoiding xenotransplantation rejection (72).Recent studies showed targeted controlled mutational events successfully generated in pig cells through nuclease-directed homologous recombination (32).\n\nIn general, various differentiation protocols are available to induce the transformation of ESCs/iPSCs into insulin-producing cells.Clinical trial results have shown its safety and tolerance, making it a hot topic in current research with broad application prospects.However, the approach of directly selecting cells from the pancreatic tissue to induce pancreatic-like organs should not be abandoned.",

            "text": "Rodents are the main laboratory animals used in establishing human disease models. However, research using rodents frequently yields findings that are not applicable to humans. Because of their anatomical and physiological resemblance to humans, pigs are an optimal model for preclinical research. Porcine models have been used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of insulin, heparin, and coagulation factors. The completion of the swine genome [1] further facilitated genetic modifications for biomedical research and applications [2]. Genetically modified pigs can serve as donors to overcome the severe shortage of human organs for transplantation [3]. Several human clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic effects of using porcine xenotransplan-tation to treat type I diabetes mellitus (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00940173), corneal disease (NCT01443559), and Parkinson's disease (NCT00226460) are ongoing. Pigs can also provide excellent sources of pluripotent stem cells for cell therapy. \n\nFluorescent proteins are critical for dissecting molecular and cellular processes in developmental biology, dynamically investigating gene expression and function in disease development, and tracking the fate of cells used in cell therapy and transplantation. In contrast to the ample resources available to researchers using fluorescent proteins of various wavelengths in rodents, fluorescent proteins available for researchers using porcine models remain under development. Our group [4] and Murakami et al. [5] have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic porcine models. Sommer et al. [6] produced transgenic pigs that expressed Stra8-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Matsunari et al. [7] successfully created Kusabira-Orange-expressing transgenic pigs. Recently, Lu et al. [8] created red-fluorescent transgenic Wuzhishan miniature pigs. However, reports of red-fluorescenceexpressing large pigs with comprehensive phenotype characterization remain scarce. In this study, we investigated monomeric red fluorescent pigs as a potential model for biomedical research on human disease.",

            "text": "Islet transplantation is a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes, but the shortage of donor organs limits its routine application. As potential donor animals, we generated transgenic pigs expressing LEA29Y, a high-affinity variant of the T-cell costimulation inhibitor CTLA-4Ig, under the control of the porcine insulin gene promoter. Neonatal islet cell clusters (ICCs) from INSLEA29Y transgenic (LEA-tg) pigs and wild-type controls were transplanted into streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic NOD-scid IL2Rg null mice. Cloned LEA-tg pigs are healthy and exhibit a strong b-cell-specific transgene expression. LEA-tg ICCs displayed the same potential to normalize glucose homeostasis as wild-type ICCs after transplantation. After adoptive transfer of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, transplanted LEA-tg ICCs were completely protected from rejection, whereas reoccurrence of hyperglycemia was observed in 80% of mice transplanted with wild-type ICCs. In the current study, we provide the first proof-of-principle report on transgenic pigs with b-cell-specific expression of LEA29Y and their successful application as donors in a xenotransplantation model. This approach may represent a major step toward the development of a novel strategy for pig-to-human islet transplantation without side effects of systemic immunosuppression. Diabetes 61:1527-1532, 2012 T ype 1 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease associated with development of severe complications (1). It has been shown that type 1 diabetes can be cured by the transplantation of the pancreas or isolated islets of Langerhans. Nonetheless, the success of pancreas and islet transplantation is limited by the shortage of organ donors and the need for systemic immunosuppressive therapy (2) and is therefore restricted to few patients (3).\n\nLimited availability of human donor organs may be overcome by the use of pigs as organ donors. Pig-to-human xenotransplantation faces the problem of strong rejection, predominantly by direct T-cell recognition of pig major histocompatibility complex and indirect T-cell response to x",

            "text": "raftment of neonatal porcine islets has recently improved considerably with the use of GT-KO donors. 103,111 Early posttransplant loss of adult islets from GT-KO can be very significant, 107 possibly due to the activation of complement by transplanted islets via the alternative pathway. 106 As shown in human islet allotransplantation, 50,129 increasing the proportion of transplanted porcine islets that stably engraft will substantially improve long-term islet graft function.\n\nSeveral immunotherapeutics with demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting immune responses to porcine islet xenografts are no longer available for clinical investigation in transplantation due to their safety profile. These include in particular anti-CD154 antibodies and also FTY720, anti-LFA-1 antibodies, and LFA-3-Ig. Alternative strategies, such as antagonistic anti-CD40 antibodies, are being investigated; however, none of these investigational antibodies will be available for clinical research in islet xenotransplantation in the very foreseeable future.\n\nThe risks of immunotherapeutic protocols being developed for initial pilot clinical trials must not be higher than the risks associated with immunosuppression currently used clinically in organ and islet allotransplantation. For islet xenotransplantation to be applied very broadly in the future, a rejection prophylaxis with a very favorable safety profile will be required. It is reasonable to assume that immunotherapeutic protocols will become increasingly more selective and safe as our understanding of the immunobiology of islet xenotransplantation improves.\n\nThe second major obstacle to broader clinical application of islet xenotransplantation is the high number of designated pathogen-free donor pancreases required for manufacturing a therapeutic patient dose of neonatal porcine and adult pig islets. The minimum number of nonencapsulated pig islets transplanted to achieve normoglycemia in NHP has been 50 000 IEQ/kg or greater for neonatal islets 99,102,103 and 25 000 IEQ/kg or greater for adult islets, 98 though much greater numbers have been transplanted in some studies",

            "text": "Animal models are essential tools for investigating the aetiology and pathogenesis of diabetes as well as for developing effective treatment methods, such as islet transplantation or genetic engineering [1,2]. Although a range of wellcharacterized and widely used models of type 1 diabetes in rodents are currently available, they do not reliably predict therapeutic outcomes in larger mammals [2][3][4]. Large animal models are a valuable complement to rodents for both physiological and practical reasons. Anatomically, the porcine and human pancreases are quite similar. In both species, it is a retroperitoneal organ, and the pancreatic head wraps the portal vein [5]. In addition, the firmness of the pig pancreatic parenchyma is similar to the gland in humans [6]. Physiologically, pig islets offer a very competitive product for \u03b2-cell replacement because of their morphological characteristics, ability to respond to glucose challenge, and cell composition and also because of the fact that the pig and human insulin differ in only one amino acid [5,7]. \n\nAmong the new emerging technologies for diabetes therapy, gene and cellular injections are currently attractive and of great potential. However, there are persistent and severe obstacles to their applications mainly because of the topography and structure of the pancreas [3]. So far, there are no effective ways of approaching the pancreas without causing significant unwanted effects, such as infection of other organs [8] or toxicity and damage of the pancreas parenchyma [3,9]. Arterial or venous injection via the pancreatic circulation has been reported in dogs [10], but surgical clamping of the pancreatic circulation was necessary. Alternatively, gene injection through the pancreatic duct has been tested in rats and mice [3], but the high infusion pressure required was related to complications like pancreatitis. \n\nSuccessful islet gene and cellular therapies will depend on the appropriate choice of the route of administration [2,10]. To make these therapies viable in the clinical setting, preclinical investigations should be aimed at identifying safe ways to deliver the cells or vectors into recipients and at defining effective methods for preventing postadministration loss of transferred elements.",

Major technological advances make xenotransplantation a potential source from which to supply enough beta cell tissue to cure a large proportion of people with type 1 diabetes [1].

However, there are potential disadvantages such as portal hypertension, bleeding, thrombosis, ischaemia, inability to perform protocol biopsies and restrictions and, to date, long-term success rates lag behind those of wholepancreas transplantation [3].\n\nSeveral sites have been investigated including muscle [4], spleen [5], portal vein [6] and the kidney subcapsular space [7]. In our companion paper (Stokes et al [8]), we compare outcomes for mouse and human islets transplanted into a range of sites.\n\nPorcine tissue is the most promising tissue source for future human xenotransplantation.

            "text": "Xenotransplant which is the transplant of organs between disparate species could be a potential solution to the obstacles preventing the I-K model from clinical trials. Use of a xenogeneic (e.g., pig) donor for the composite I-K transplant would allow for preparation of composite I-K's in living donors, as well as eliminating the risk of not obtaining the sufficient islet volume required to correct diabetes in recipients without inducing diabetes in the donors. Xenogeneic tissue grafts of course would provide a near-limitless supply of tissues and organs for this purpose. \n\nSwine would make an ideal candidate for donor tissues to be used in human xenotransplantation (63,64). It would of course have been unreasonable to attempt xenogeneic I-K transplantation until the success of xenogeneic renal transplantation reached a stage where survivals would justify extending the procedure to a composite organ in preclinical pig-to-non-human primate models. Recently, however, investigators both in our center (65) and elsewhere (66,67) have reported renal xenograft survivals of well over 6 months in pig-to-nonhuman primate models. In contrast to renal xenografts maintained with chronic immunosuppression which have eventually progressed to organ loss due to chronic rejection, we have achieved longer than 6 months survival of life-supporting pig kidneys utilizing the tolerance-inducing approach of vascularized thymic grafts (65) (Yamada K. et al. manuscript in preparation) in multiple baboon recipients. These animals were pig specific unresponsive and developed new T cells from the pig thymic grafts. Unfortunately, due to the size disparity between the two species the recipients were ultimately euthanized due to the development of cortical ischemia in the grafts and compartment syndrome in the small baboons caused by the growth of the pig life-supporting kidneys. Even though humans are much larger than the small baboons used in the study, and in theory should not have the same issue, the problems caused by organ growth should be addressed in future studies.",

The first is the status of production and breeding of transgenic pigs to be used as donors of the xenotransplantation. The second will be in-vivo testing of the immunocompatibility of pig hearts and the final step would be orthotopic cardiac graft to check the physiologic and functional aspect of the graft heart. \n\nThe first part of the research was performed by the National Institute of Animal Science of Rural Development Administration and 2 companies, Optipharm Inc and Mgenplus. They produced various kinds of transgenic pigs for xenotransplantation and the current available transgenic pigs are listed in the review paper. 60) Park and associates in 2019 60) reviewed the history of the research on xenotransplantation in Korea and summarized the contribution of Xenotransplantation Research Center at the Seoul National University Hospital. \n\nThe second part of the research was on the heterotopic cardiac graft using porcine hearts to non-human primates. Lee et al. 61) started xenotransplantation in 2012 to place the pig heart to Cynomolgus monkey, heterotopically. The aorta of the pig heart was anastomosed to abdominal aorta and the pulmonary trunk of pig heart was connected to the inferior vena cava of the recipients such that the bold perfused coronary arteries through aorta drained to the coronary sinus, right atrial and ventricular chambers to the pulmonary trunk to drain back to the venous system of the monkey. The left ventricular chamber therefore was not used as a pump but the porcine myocardium was perfused by the monkey's blood. In their experiment 22 monkeys received genetically manipulated pigs' hearts. The genetic status of pigs was GGTA1 knockout (GalT KO) pigs and 6 of those pigs were additionally expressed with human CD46 or CD39 or CD73. The pigs weighed from 3 to 10 kg, with the hearts weighing 23 to 71 g. Recipients were Cynomolgus monkey, and their body weights were 3 to 7 kg. For transplantation, ABO blood types were matched.",

            "text": "cine insulin works well in humans, the pig has been suggested as a kidney or pancreas organ donor for humans with chronic kidney disease or diabetes. While humoral rejection is ameliorated following transplantation into nonhuman primates of kidneys from pigs transgenic for the human complement activator, decay accelerating factor [35], or the use of kidneys or organs from transgenics that do not express alpha 1,3 galactosyltransferase [36], neither the immunosuppressive regimens used for pig to primate kidney transplantation nor the outcomes would be acceptable in humans. The severity of humoral rejection effectively precludes the use of pigs as whole pancreas organ donors for humans. However, because they are vascularized by the host after transplantation, islets like other cell transplants are not subject to humoral rejection. Recent experience with pig to primate islet or neonatal islet transplantation shows that sustained insulin independence can be achieved, but only through the use of immunosuppressive agents that are not approved for human use or that result in a high level of morbidity and mortality in diabetic primates [37][38][39]. Thus, the need for host immune suppression is a barrier for pig-to-primate kidney or islet xenotransplantation.\n\nThe use of individual cells including stem cells to regenerate or repair damaged kidney tissue or differentiate into insulin-producing cells (cell therapies) offers an alternative to whole organ replacement. Since cells are nonvascularized, these approaches can circumvent humoral rejection of xenogeneic tissue mediated by preformed antibodies directed against donor endothelial antigens.

            "text": "The pig has been used as a teaching and research animal model in surgery in the past decades. Starting in the 1990s, it became so prominent in academic and surgical training that it can be regarded as default model for non-survival surgical teaching classes, substituting the dog (Swindle, 2007). Its ubiquitous presence and use in academia, enabled also its widespread adoption in multiple models of liver, lung, heart, pancreas and kidney transplantation (Marubayashi et al., 1995;Martin et al., 1999;He et al., 2013;Fonouni et al., 2015;Mariscal et al., 2018). Furthermore, in transplantation medicine, the pig has also been proposed as xenograft donor, where porcine grafts have been transplanted into non-human primates with different degrees of success (Sachs et al., 2009;Griesemer et al., 2014). This has encouraged several research groups to target the porcine genome to eliminate the major xeno-antigen(s) recognized by human natural antibodies, in a so-called effort of humanizing the pig (Lai et al., 2002;Phelps et al., 2003;Petersen et al., 2011;Jeong et al., 2013). If ultimately realized, these procedures might enable the future xenotransplantation of porcine organs into humans as the main approach for transplantation medicine. Efforts are currently being taken to reduce the risk of viral zoonosis from porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), either by pharmacological treatment of PERV or by inactivating it with gene editing tools (Denner, 2017;Niu et al., 2017). Finally, other efforts have been concentrated on porcine uterus, urethra, kidney or liver bioengineering for transplantation (Baptista et al., 2011;Sullivan et al., 2012;Campo et al., 2017;Simoes et al., 2017). All these are an important testimony of the relevance of the pig as a vital translation research animal model.",

Islet xenotransplantation (namely the use of animal islets, with the aim of transplanting them into humans), or stem cell technology (the controlled differentiation of stem cells to obtain specialised cells for the treatment of diabetes) are other procedures currently being evaluated in animal models.

Long-term culture of porcine islets is a crucial challenge to permit the on-demand provision of islets. We aimed to identify the optimal temperature for the long-term culture of adult porcine islets for xenotransplantation. We evaluated the factors potentially influencing successful 28-day culture of islets at 24\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, and found that culture at 37\u00b0C contributed to the stability of the morphology of the islets, the proliferation of islet cells, and the recovery of endocrine function, indicated by the expression of genes involved in pancreatic development, hormone production, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These advantages may be provided by islet-derived CD146-positive stellate cells. The efficacy of xenotransplantation using islets cultured for a long time at 37\u00b0C was similar to that of overnight-cultured islets. In conclusion, 37\u00b0C might be a suitable temperature for the long-term culture of porcine islets, but further modifications will be required for successful xenotransplantation in a clinical setting.",

            "text": "Although substantial progress has been made in islet xenotransplantation, 2 significant obstacles to clinical application remain.\n\nFirst, a clinically applicable immunosuppressive protocol for preventing rejection of porcine islet xenografts is currently not available. 118 Regimens that protect islet allografts in NHP and humans from rejection, including basiliximab combined with FTY720 and everolimus 124 and antithymocyte globulin combined with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, 125 fail to facilitate long-term islet xenograft survival in NHPs, 98,111 indicating that either the immunity to islet xenografts is stronger than islet allografts or that additional immune recognition and effector pathways are operative in xenoislet compared with alloislet transplantation. As summarized above, prolonged porcine islet xenograft survival has been achieved with protocols based on CD154-CD40 costimulatory blockade by several groups. However, long-term functional survival exceeding 180 days, the efficacy milestone to be met in 5 or more of 8 NHP before initiating clinical trials according to the consensus statement of the International Xenotransplantation Association, 126,127 has been demonstrated in only a small proportion of transplanted NHPs (1 to 2 of 3 to 7 in several studied cohorts; Table 1). Lack of more consistent success could be ascribed to failure of the protocol to prevent rejection or to failure of the preclinical model to accommodate the protocol. 128 Therefore, continued understanding and improvement of the preclinical animal model is a critical requirement for documenting longterm success on a consistent basis.\n\nLong-term success has also been precluded by a high proportion of engraftment failure after porcine islet transplantation due to IBMIR and complement-mediated lysis of islets triggered by binding of preformed xenoreactive antibodies. Engraftment of neonatal porcine islets has recently improved considerably with the use of GT-KO donors. 103,111 Early posttransplant loss of adult islets from GT-KO can be very significant, 107 possibly due to the activation of complement by transplanted islets via the alternative pathway. 106",

            "text": "A STZdiabetic rat can be rendered normoglycemic lifelong with no exogenous insulin requirement by transplantation of 5 -8 pig pancreatic primordia. Extrapolating, it would take 100 -200 primordia to render a diabetic macaque independent of exogenous insulin. A second explanation is proposed by Graham and Schuurman in their recent review of the usefulness and limitations of the diabetic macaque model in evaluating long-term survival of porcine islets [16]. The authors propose that there are three main contributors to the mild hyperglycemia that is common in xenografted diabetic non-human primates: 1) species incompatibilitiesunderlying a lower insulin secretion rate by the porcine graft; 2) the set point in insulinsecretion that is at higher blood glucose levels in pigs than in monkeys; and 3) a marginal mass of engrafted islets. The authors speculate the mild hyperglycemia observed in transplanted diabetic primates might not be of high relevance when considering the use of porcine islet transplantation in human diabetics. This is because humans and pigs have normal fasting blood glucose values in a similar range while in primates, the values are much lower. Additionally, the authors suggest, if the intrinsic insulin-producing capacity of porcine islets is lower than that of human islets, the effective dose of porcine islets may need to need to be increased. A similar argument could apply to the \"effective dose\" of porcine pancreatic primordia, in which case more than 100 -200 may be required to render a diabetic macaque independent of exogenous insulin. Alternatively, unlike the case for mature islets, beta cell precursors in transplanted embryonic pancreas have the potential to differentiate into a mass of mature insulin-producing cells sufficient to render a diabetic host euglycemic. A single native embryonic pancreas does so in every non-diabetic pig, primate or human. Future efforts are appropriately directed to engineering transplanted pig pancreatic primordia towards more robust differentiation within the in vivo bioreactor that is the diabetic host.",

The use of animal organs in humans has been long been tested: a baboon heart was transplanted into a newborn infant, Baby Fae, who had hypoplastic left heart syndrome and lived 20 days after heart surgery [8] and a baboon liver was transplanted to a patient with hepatic failure [9]. In addition to the replacement of the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys from non-human animals to human, xenotransplantation is also being developed to use xenogeneic cells such as porcine islet cell for diabetes, porcine dopaminergic neurons for Parkinson's disease and porcine hepatocytes for liver failure, which all demonstrate cross-species physiologic activity and metabolic regulation in host human tissues [10][11][12]. With the advent of genetic engineering, genomic editing and cloning technologies, the pathobiological barriers to successful porcine organ xenotransplantation might be resolved by transplanting organs from genetically engineered pigs such as \u03b11,3galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO) pigs to delete xenoantigens on pig organs for protecting them from the human immune responses [13,14].",

            "text": "Introduction: Islet xenotransplantation may be a therapeutic option in type 1 diabetes. Recent advances in generating genetically modified source pigs offer advantages as immune suppressants can potentially be eliminated after the transplantation. Therapy monitoring would greatly benefit from noninvasive methods for assessing the viability of transplanted islets. Peptide-based positron emission tomography (PET) targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) expression on beta cells may offer a procedure that can directly be translated from an experimental setting to the clinic. The aim of this study was to establish the labeling of the GLP1R ligand [ 68 Ga]Ga-exendin-4, to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging porcine islet xenografts in vivo and to compare signal quality for three different transplantation sites in a mouse model. Materials and methods: Mice with engrafted neonatal porcine islet cell clusters (NPICCs) under the kidney capsule, into the inguinal fold, or the lower hindlimb muscle were studied. After reaching normoglycemia, the mice were injected with [ 68 Ga]Ga-exendin-4 for PET data acquisition. Subsequent autoradiography (AR) was used for comparing ex vivo data with in vivo uptake. Results: NPICCs in the lower right hindlimb muscle could be detected in vivo and in AR. Due to the high background in the kidney and urinary bladder, islets could not be detected in the PET data at transplantation sites close to these organs, while AR showed a clear signal for the islets in the inguinal fold. Discussion: PET with [ 68 Ga]Ga-exendin-4 detects islets transplanted in the hindlimb muscle tissue of mice, offering the potential of longitudinal monitoring of viable porcine islets. Other sites are not suitable for in vivo imaging owing to high activity accumulation of Exendin-4 in kidney and bladder.",

The four reported trials are briefly reviewed and, in the light of the present status of experimental islet xenotransplantation, consideration is given to whether such trials are currently justified. The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association has (1) emphasized the need for encouraging studies in non\u2010human primates before clinical trials should be undertaken, (2) mandatory monitoring for the transfer of porcine microorganisms, and (3) careful regulation and oversight by recognized bodies. Other aspects of the topic, such as the need for informed consent, are briefly discussed. We conclude that, at the present time, more data documenting convincing efficacy, focused on clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimens, are needed to justify the initiation of closely monitored clinical trials. A clinical trial may then be justified even though the potential risk to the patients, and possibly for society, will not be zero.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency primarily due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2\u2010cells. The prevailing treatment for T1DM involves daily subcutaneous insulin injections, but a substantial proportion of patients face challenges such as severe hypoglycemic episodes and poorly controlled hyperglycemia. For T1DM patients, a more effective therapeutic option involves the replacement of \u03b2\u2010cells through allogeneic transplantation of either the entire pancreas or isolated pancreatic islets. Unfortunately, the scarcity of transplantable human organs has led to a growing list of patients waiting for an islet transplant. One potential alternative is xenotransplantation of porcine pancreatic islets. However, due to inter\u2010species molecular incompatibilities, porcine tissues trigger a robust immune response in humans, leading to xenograft rejection. Several promising strategies aim to overcome this challenge and enhance the long\u2010term survival and functionality of xenogeneic islet grafts. These strategies include the use of islets derived from genetically modified pigs, immunoisolation of islets by encapsulation in biocompatible materials, and the creation of an immunomodulatory microenvironment by co\u2010transplanting islets with accessory cells or utilizing immunomodulatory biomaterials. This review concentrates on delineating the primary obstacles in islet xenotransplantation and elucidates the fundamental principles and recent breakthroughs aimed at addressing these challenges.",

In addition, transplantation of galactosyl knock-out neonate pig islets was found to significantly enhance normoglycemia rates in diabetic primates, likely due to the decreased susceptibility of these xenografts to innate immunity mediated by complement and preformed xenoantibodies [33] . These results, however, required treatment with a heavy immunosuppressive regimen, in particular an anti-CD154-specific mAb, an antibody that induced thromboembolic events precluding its clinical use [34] . Despite the unacceptability of these immunosuppressive regimens in humans, these results are very encouraging since an alternative, nontoxic regimen combined with xenotransplantation of pig islets may induce normoglycemia in diabetic patients. \n\nA bioartificial pancreas, in which islets of Langerhans are encapsulated within a semipermeable membrane, may be an alternative therapeutic device for patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. It may constitute a safe and simple method of transplanting islets without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Since the semipermeable membrane protects the islets from the host immune system, the islets are likely to survive and release insulin for a long period of time, thereby controlling glucose metabolism in the absence of immunosuppressive medication.

Unfortunately, the shortage of available organs for transplant results in many patients never reaching transplantation and dying from their organ failure. In the case of end-stage kidney disease, dialysis may offer a life-preserving alternative but still falls well short of the outcomes achieved by kidney transplantation (1). In the United States, the insufficient supply of donor kidneys has resulted in an ever-lengthening waiting list, with average waiting times exceeding 4 years (2). In other forms of organ failure, an alternative therapy akin to dialysis is less readily available, and many patients will die while awaiting an organ that never arrives. \n\nXenotransplantation represents the most readily available solution to this donor organ shortage. While artificial or bioengineered organs offer many theoretical advantages, the realization of these technologies is likely many years away, whereas the recent developments in laboratory and preclinical research into xenotransplantation have progressed to the point of clinical translation. Indeed, 6 human recipients of porcine xenografts (2 heart, 4 kidney) have been reported (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). \n\nThe experience gained from these 5 recipients will undoubtedly be critical in the further development of the field. However, there is still much that can be learned in pre-clinical translational models that will help understand the immune response to a xenograft and examine the function of that xenograft post-transplantation. These experiments may help improve the outcomes for xenotransplant recipients, broaden the scale of xenotransplant availability, or help develop the next generation of geneticallymodified source animals. In this manuscript, we will review the two major pre-clinical models in kidney xenotransplantation: non-human primates (NHP) and human decedents. We will compare and contrast these models, focusing on their ability to examine the physiology and pharmacology of kidney xenotransplantation.",

These are: comparable human and pig body sizes, similar anatomical and physiological characteristics, genomic composition and ordinary diets (Hou et al., 2022). It makes the pig a promising alternative animal model for humans. Rapid growth rate, early sexual maturity, short generation intervals, high number of offspring per litter, and standardized breeding techniques, also make easier the application of pigs in the study on human diseases. In recent decades, the advances in technologies contribute to the development of genetically engineered pig models of human diseases. The emergence of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and reliable genome editing techniques make possible for the generation of porcine models of human diseases. The efficacy of porcine SCNT has been largely improved and several kinds of small molecular inhibitors have been applied to enhance the developmental competence of SCNT embryos (Ouyang et al., 2021;Hou et al., 2022). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing strategies are widely used in the establishment of porcine models of human diseases. Various genomic genetically engineered pigs have been generated, including chimeric gene knock in, point mutations, large genome fragment deletions, multifunctional live cell sensors, etc. One of the most promising potential application of pigs in the biomedical field is xenotransplantation. In 7 January 2022, the medical school of the University of Maryland in the United States conducted the first-ever life-saving cardiac xenotransplantation and it was successful in extending the patient's life for about 8 weeks (Rothblatt, 2022).

Necessary improvements include more appropriate biocompatible materials with sufficient supplies of oxygen and nutrients, maintenance of secretory insulin permeability for rapid glycemic control, the maintenance of isolation from the host's immune system, and the ability to suppress the inflammatory response. 30 ere, we created a BAP device by encapsulating adult porcine islets in a developed alginate gel with excellent permeability and stability and then enclosing them in a highly biocompatible semipermeable membrane bag with immunoisolation capability. The transplantation of these devices into the abdominal cavities of immunocompetent wild-type diabetic mice without the use of any immunosuppressant led to a clear and rapid lowering of blood glucose and long-term glycemic control and survival of porcine islets. One of its main advantages is that it can be easily retrieved with almost no adhesion, even after long-term transplantation. Furthermore, the devices still functioned after their retrieval from the first transplanted mice and their relay-transplantation into new immunocompetent wild-type diabetic mice. This is the first report of such a device that still functioned after two transplants and that therefore withstood discordant xenogeneic biological reactions twice.",

Xenotransplantation is a strategy to overcome supply problems. Implantation of tissue obtained early during embryogenesis is a way to reduce transplant immunogenicity. Insulin-producing cells originating from embryonic pig pancreas obtained very early following pancreatic primordium formation (embryonic day 28 (E28)) engraft long-term in non-immune, suppressed diabetic rats or rhesus macaques. Morphologically, similar cells originating from adult porcine islets of Langerhans (islets) engraft in non-immune-suppressed rats or rhesus macaques previously transplanted with E28 pig pancreatic primordia. Our data are consistent with induction of tolerance to an endocrine cell component of porcine islets induced by previous transplantation of embryonic pig pancreas, a novel finding we designate organogenetic tolerance.

            "text": "Optimizing pig donor age for multi-organ retrieval for xenoTx poses a significant practical problem for companies seeking to raise pigs for xenotransplantation. Arefranian/Rayat et al. present a study that compares the functional performance of neonatal pig islets at ages, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days, with the aim to identify a preferable donor age. They concluded that islets from 7-day-old donors offer higher yields and better functions. \n\nMost studies focusing on porcine islet physiology examine beta cell function and insulin secretion, but less is known about glucagon responses by porcine alpha cells. Mourad et al. at the University Catholique de Louvain assessed glucagon secretion by comparing neonatal porcine islets with adult porcine islets. Glucagon and insulin were assessed both in vitro through dynamic perifusion of isolated islets and in vivo with glucose tolerance tests. Porcine beta cells have been known to be less responsive to glucose stimulation than human beta cells; however, Mourad et al. demonstrated that porcine alpha cells are particularly responsive to glucose changes. These findings suggest the critical role of glucagon in porcine islet physiology and underscore the importance of characterizing species-specific differences in endocrine cell function. The combination of low insulin response to glucose by beta cells and the potent glucose-mediated inhibitory response of glucagon secretion by alpha cells may explain the supraphysiologic blood glucose levels in recipients after porcine islet transplantation even if adequate numbers of islets are transplanted. \n\nThe other studies included in this Research Topic introduce new and emerging strategies for islet replacement. Kano et al. describes progress led by his group and others in organogenesis using blastocyst complementation. Since it was first proposed in 2010, substantial technical improvements have led to notable successes in rat-to-mouse islet xenotransplantation (19). This technology is still in its infancy, and there are still challenges that limit the rapid translation of these results from small animal studies to large animal interspecies studies.",

            "text": "Background. For patients who have difficulty controlling blood glucose even with insulin administration, xenogeneic islet cells, including human stem cell-derived pancreatic islets (hSC-islet) and porcine islets, have garnered attention as potential solutions to challenges associated with donor shortages. For the development of diabetes treatment modalities that use cell transplantation therapy, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transplanted cells using experimental animals over the long term. Methods. We developed permanent diabetic immune-deficient mice by introducing the Akita (C96Y) mutation into the rodent-specific Insulin1 gene of NOD/Shi-scid IL2r\u03b3cnull (NOG) mice (Ins1C96Y/C96Y NOG). Their body weight, nonfasting blood glucose, and survival were measured from 4\u2009wk of age. Insulin sensitivity was assessed via tolerance tests. To elucidate the utility of these mice in xenotransplantation experiments, we transplanted hSC-islet cells or porcine islets under the kidney capsules of these mice. Results. All male and female homozygous mice exhibited persistent severe hyperglycemia associated with \u03b2-cell depletion as early as 4\u2009wk of age and exhibited normal insulin sensitivity. These mice could be stably engrafted with hSC-islets, and the mice that received porcine islet grafts promptly exhibited lowered blood glucose levels, maintaining blood glucose levels below the normal glucose range for at least 52\u2009wk posttransplantation. Conclusions. The Ins1C96Y/C96Y NOG mouse model provides an effective platform to assess both the efficacy and safety of long-term xenograft engraftment without the interference of their immune responses. This study is expected to contribute essential basic information for the clinical application of islet cell transplantation.",

[83].Different strategies and biomaterials for encapsulation of pig islets are under investigation, with one highlight being 6-month survival of pig islets after alginate macroencapsulation in diabetic monkeys [84].Also, different sites of implantation, mainly the peritoneal cavity and omentum, but also the bone marrow, are being investigated with respect to the loss of function and limited survival due to pericapsular fibrosis.\n\nThe progress in the field of encapsulated porcine islets has been reviewed elsewhere in detail [79].",

            "text": "As a result of further development of genetically engineered pigs, many pig-to-NHP transplantations were performed as the final step toward preclinical studies. Among them, a pig-tobaboon heart transplant experiment at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported a long survival time of up to 945 days (33). In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the GalT-KO pigs, the platforms for all transgenic pigs, as a source of human therapeutics including xenotransplantation. In 2022, the University of Alabama reported that a kidney derived from a genetically modified pig was transplanted into a brain-dead decedent (34), which marked the first clinical application of xenotransplantation from a pig to a human. The 10-GE pig kidneys were transplanted into a man who was brain dead from head trauma after bilateral nephrectomy. No HAR and PERV transmission were observed. Although the porcine kidney produced urine within 30 min, serum creatinine did not decrease during the study period. Histological findings on postoperative periods demonstrated endothelial injury with diffuse thrombotic microangiopathy. The decedent's general condition deteriorated after transplantation, leading to progressive multiple organ failure. Thus, the study was terminated only after 3 days. Further study, including the mechanisms and prevention of microvascular injuries, is required to uncover the etiology of poor renal recovery. \n\nPig islet transplantation into a human has a longer history than organ transplantation in xenotransplantation (35)(36)(37). Transplantation of encapsulated wild-type porcine islets to established brittle type 1 diabetes mellitus was performed without immunosuppression, which resulted in improved HbA1c and reduced unaware hypoglycemic events (37). However, only a slight decrease in insulin doses was observed, and no patient could achieve insulin independence. Aside from encapsulated islet transplantation, there have been attempts to transplant naked porcine islets into NHPs.",

            "text": "The demonstration of prolonged diabetes reversal after porcine islet xenotransplantation in NHPs suggests that porcine islets could be developed into a widely available cell source for cell replacement therapy in diabetes. To work toward this end, safer and more effective startegies for preventing islet xenograft rejection will be necessary. Understanding the differences in carbohydrate antigens expressed on procine and human islets could minimize the immunogenicity of islets from porcine donors custom-engineered for use in islet xenotransplantation. \n\nOur MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MS/MS analysis of glycans identified differenes between porcine and human islets. Our results confirm that porcine islets have NeuGc in N-and O-glycan forms, albeit no \u03b1-Gal or Sd a epitope was detected from any of the islets (Figs 2 and 7). The study also proposed novel glycan structures that exist only in porcine islets; the high-mannose type N-glycans with core fucosylation and complex-type N-glycans with terminal neuraminic acid residues, which can be potential gene targets for genetic engineering to generate superior porcine islet donors (Figs 3-5). \n\nOur findings build upon two series of studies that performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of carbohydrate antigens of porcine islets using mass spectrometry (Table 1) [34][35][36][37][38]. Kim et al. detected 80 N-glycans, which includes NeuGc epitopes and a negligible amount of \u03b1-Gal epitope, but they did not include in their analysis a direct comparison between porcine and human islet glycan profiles [34,35]. Miyagawa et al. compared porcine and human islets and reported that 12 of 28 and 9 of 24 N-glycans found from adult and neonatal wildtype pigs were detected exclusively on porcine islets, respectively [36,38].",

            "text": "Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) so far is treated with a constant low dose insulin injection and immunosuppressive agents. But a large quantity of clinical data indicated that longterm insulin injection could induce insulin resistance and was not favorable to prevent some serious complications [1] . Longterm application of immunosuppressive drugs, for example, high-dose cyclosporine and tacrolimus, could bring about toxic effects on islets and normal liver and kidney [2,3] . So in some cases, it is limited to use immunosuppressive drugs for a long period at high dose. However, islet transplantation has the potential to cure diabetes mellitus [4] , especially insulindependent diabetes mellitus [5] . Islet transplantation could make insulin maintain normal level of blood glucose and prevent serious complications. In general, islet allotransplantation is safe and efficient to reduce hyperglycemia, and leads to insulin independence in patients with insulin dependent diabetes [6,7] . But this kind of islets source is limited, which becomes the chief obstacle for treating patients. So it is necessary to find alternative islet sources, such as xenotransplantation of islets of new-born pigs. However, the rejection for xenotransplantation should be mornitored efficiently. Usually, the way of preventing rejection lies in using high dose of immunosuppressive drugs, which gives rise to serious side effects. On the other hand, pre-injection of a suitable number of the same donor lymphocytes or blood cells could induce immune tolerance in different kinds of organ transplantations [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] . Some other laboratories also reported that immunologic isolation, or transplantation of microencapsulated islets, could reduce rejection of islet xenotransplantation [15,16] . In the present study, pig islet xenotransplantation in mice was performed after injection of donor hepatocytes, splenocytes or their mixture.",

            "text": "Despite continuous advances in technology for islet encapsulation, the paucity of islet donors remains a barrier to the widespread use of artificial islets. Porcine insulin is structurally very similar to human insulin, and the porcine islet supply is not an issue at present, as access is very easy to achieve, making porcine islets a reliable replacement for human ones (83,84). Porcine islets are derived from high-quality donors, unlike human donors, who are often elderly or deceased, and porcine islets can be modified by genetic engineering to reduce the immune response, resulting in an improved transplant success (85). \n\nHowever, immune rejection remains a major obstacle to porcine islet xenotransplantation. Matsumoto et al. used alginate to wrap neonatal porcine islets and implanted them intraperitoneally in patients with T1DM in an experimental group. Their findings suggested undetected porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) infection in all subjects, with the HbA1c level maintained at <7%, thus significantly reducing hypoglycemic events. Longer-term maintenance was feasible, as no ISAs were applied, suggesting that immune shielding of porcine islets is an effective approach to address xenogeneic rejection (86). Lew et al. constructed exenatidel-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres after determining the suitable drug-loading capacity and coencapsulated them in alginate microcapsules with porcine islets. The addition of exenatide reduced the rate of islet cell death and improved the stimulatory response to glucose, further enhancing the transplantation success of microencapsulated porcine islets (87). LBL technology-based nanofilms as well as islet surface modification are an additional option for porcine islet xenotransplantation. Haque et al. combined SH-6-arm-peglipid and gelatin-catechol to construct a bilayer structured artificial extracellular matrix for encapsulating and stabilizing porcine islets against cell detachment.",

The diabetic non-human primate model has been used extensively to show the efficacy of transplanted adult and neonatal porcine islets with variable degrees of success in a number of preclinical studies as reviewed here [1][2][3]. Naturally, preserving implanted islets from the host immune response was central in most of these studies. Once this primordial step has been achieved by means of immunosuppression, encapsulation, genetic modification of donors, or a combination of these strategies, the efficacy of porcine islet transplantation is evaluated by looking for signs of diabetes alleviation and by verifying secretory function of grafted tissue. Moreover, host testing for possible porcine pathogens is undertaken to demonstrate biosafety of islet xenotransplantation. With regard to all of these factors that will determine the outcome of pig islet transplantation in preclinical and clinical trials, genetic modification of donors is set to become an unavoidable step.",

Although these different types of implants have not yet been sufficiently investigated and compared for their biologic properties, porcine islet cell grafts are expected to be superior to currently used human islet cell grafts in terms of their capacity to reproducibly achieve a metabolically adequate functional b-cell mass with physiologic properties. Their production can rely on expertise in industrial pig farming for breeding high-health, medical-grade pigs as organ donors, with the option of using sources that are genetically engineered to facilitate cell survival in humans. Guidelines for clinical testing have been established [11] and measures identified for protecting survival of xenografted porcine b cells in rodents and nonhuman primates [10,[12][13][14].

            "text": "Autologous BMSCs transplantation specifically targeted into the pancreas has demonstrated efficacy in restoring islet functionality, enhancing the function of \u03b2-cells, and improving glucose tolerance in miniature pigs with early-stage DM. The transplantation of BMSCs has the potential to reverse high hyperglycemia, leading to a temporary elimination of the need for exogenous insulin treatment and the preservation of blood glucose homeostasis. Moreover, the transplantation of BMSCs may enhance the process of islet repair by facilitating differentiation into new islets and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, as well as modulating the microcirculation inside the pancreas [180]. Yamada et al. have elucidated that neonatal porcine BMSCs xenotransplantation showed a beneficial therapeutic impact on diabetic wound repairment owing to its ability to stimulate early-stage lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis through the secretion of multiple growth factors, including TGF-\u03b21, VEGFA, and VEGFC [181]. \n\nThe human umbilical cord MSCs conditioned medium treatment improved the viability of neonatal porcine islet cell clusters, exhibited inhibitory effects on apoptosis, while promoting autophagic, and elevating the levels of phosphorylated Akt and PI3K class III [182]. Furthermore, it was observed that this conditioned medium reduced the proportion of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to total mTOR under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, Exosomes derived from hUCMSCs protected neonatal porcine islet cell clusters from the malfunction caused by hypoxia and played a significant role in enhancing resistance to hypoxia through, indicating a promising approach to enhance the outcomes of islet transplantation [183]. Prolonged hyperglycemia induces a range of physiological reactions in the kidneys, collectively referred to as renal stress responses. Clinically, it has been observed that episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in individuals with DM are associated with an increased cumulative probability of progressing to end-stage chronic kidney disease [184].",

            "text": "Transplantation has been considered one of the medical miracles which can cure incurable diseases (Dalal, 2015). On the other hand, transplantation has been associated with the donor shortage which leads to organ trafficking and organ tourism (Dalal, 2015). The Istanbul declaration, supported by World Health Organization, has emphasized the importance of changing this situation (Dalal, 2015). One of the ultimate solutions for this situation is xenotransplantation. Among the xenotransplantation options, islet xenotransplantation using porcine islets has been considered to be the closest to the clinical reality (Groth et al., 1994). In fact, the initial islet xenotransplantation was conducted in 90s (Groth et al., 1994). Since then several clinical trials of islet xenotransplantation were conducted; however, clear clinical benefits were rarely shown (Matsumoto et al., 2014;Valdes-Gonzalez et al., 2005;Valdes-Gonzalez et al., 2010). \n\nThe standard therapy for the type 1 diabetes is intensive insulin therapy which can reduce HbA1c. However the drawback is increasing hypoglycemic episodes (The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1997). Beta-cell replacement therapy including pancreas and islet transplantation can normalize HbA1c without increasing hypoglycemic episodes; however, the donor shortage and the necessity of immunosuppressant are major issues to apply the treatments widely (Matsumoto, 2010). To alleviate the donor shortage, islet transplantation using non-heart beating human donor was conducted (Matsumoto et al., 2006), and a living donor (Matsumoto et al., 2005), but these approaches can never solve this issue generally. Islet xenotransplantation may be one of the ultimate solutions to solve the shortage of donated organs. \n\nIn this study, we conducted islet xenotransplantation using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppressive drugs which resulted in clinical benefit for unstable type 1 diabetic patients.",

            "text": "Pig-to-human xenotransplantation offers a potential bridge to the growing disparity between patients with end-stage organ failure and graft availability. Early studies attempting to overcome cross-species barriers demonstrated robust humoral immune responses to discordant xenoantigens. Recent advances have led to highly efficient and targeted genomic editing, drastically altering the playing field towards rapid production of less immunogenic porcine tissues and even the discussion of human xenotransplantation trials. However, as these humoral immune barriers to cross-species transplantation are overcome with advanced transgenics, cellular immunity to these novel xenografts remains an outstanding issue. Therefore, understanding and optimizing immunomodulation will be paramount for successful clinical xenotransplantation. Costimulation blockade agents have been introduced in xenotransplantation research in 2000 with anti-CD154mAb. Most recently, prolonged survival has been achieved in solid organ (kidney xenograft survival\u2009>\u2009400 days with anti-CD154mAb, heart xenograft survival\u2009>\u2009900 days, and liver xenograft survival 29 days with anti-CD40mAb) and islet xenotransplantation (>600 days with anti-CD154mAb) with the use of these potent experimental agents. As the development of novel genetic modifications and costimulation blocking agents converges, we review their impact thus far on preclinical xenotransplantation and the potential for future application.",

These pigs show typical features of progressive diabetes, including cataract development and pathology of kidneys and the nervous system (Renner et al. 2012 b). \n\nTransgenic pigs with \u03b2-cell specific expression of LEA29Y served as donors in a xenotransplantation model. Xenograft islet cell clusters from these pigs rescued diabetes and prevented rejection in a humanized mouse model (Klymiuk et al. 2012). Transgenic cloned pigs have also been produced carrying a dominant negative mutant for a hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 mutation showing obvious diabetic symptoms (Umeyama et al. 2009). The use of islets from pigs transgenic for a fluorogenic protein GFP (green fluorescent protein or Kusabira-Orange) may facilitate development of islet cell xenotransplantation (Teratani et al. 2012).",

As a result of these efforts, costeffective generation of donor pigs will be possible, and it is expected that porcine islets will be delivered to many patients who truly need this treatment modality. Some countries have responded to this consensus statement. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also revised the \"guidelines on public health infection problems associated with the implementation of xenotransplantation\" in 2016. Xenotransplantation can be used to treat serious diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. Also, patients who cannot currently receive transplants may be able to receive transplants 2 Medical animals can provide high-quality cells, tissues, and organs. Genetically modified animals may further improve outcomes. Medical animals are limited to closed colonies. Breeding should be done at a well-controlled pathogen-free facility, with high standards for animal welfare. Medical animals are verified by testing for the absence of known pathogens and, moreover, must be kept free of infectious diseases by continuous observation 3 Xenotransplantation is a complex procedure with risk of rejection, poor graft function, and known or unknown infections. There is a risk of developing serious or new infections, and patients, relatives, or other humans and animals may be infected 4 Because of the risk to the community at large, clinical trials of xenotransplantation should be conducted under strict regulation. Xenotransplantation should not be performed in the absence of national regulations. These regulations should have legal basis and be able to prohibit nonregulatory transplants. Furthermore, this regulatory framework should ensure transparency to the general public and should include both science and ethics 5 \n\nGiven the risk to the community, the benefit to the patient should be high. In particular, preclinical studies should be conducted using animal experiments with predictable effects to demonstrate the safety and efficacy recommended by the international scientific community. Proposed clinical trials should be assessed by the relevant regulatory authorities to minimize risk 6 Personnel responsible for clinical trials should explain the inclusion criteria in order to justify the clinical trial.",

With respect to clinical trials of xenotransplantation, there is little evidence of transmission of xenogenic endogenous virus transmission (Elliott et al., 2005;Garkavenko et al., 2011). Porcine islets have even been used in two clinical trials of islet transplantation, one in Mexico (Valdes-Gonzales et al., 2005) and one in New Zealand (Garkavenko et al., 2011). The Mexico trial involved transplantation of collagen generating devices embedded with islet and sertoli cells into twelve juvenile type 1 diabetic patients. The purpose of the sertolli cells was to prevent the action of the immune system. This procedure did not produce long term insulin independence, but glycemic control was improved along with positive porcine C-peptide in patient urine during long term follow-up. A second noteworthy clinical trial is being performed in New Zealand using alginate encapsulated neonatal porcine islets transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of type 1 diabetic patients. The pigs used were raised in pathogen-free facilities with a donor herd free from conventional pathogens and non-transmittable PERV. This unique lack of exposure to viruses is a characteristic of these pigs which were raised on the island of New Zealand with limited exposure to foreign diseases. In terms of xenogenic related infection, zoonosis has been rigorously monitored with no evidence of cross-species infection. Again, no patients became insulin independent, but there was a significant reduction in hypoglycemic unawareness episodes. This encapsulation method demonstrates the usefulness of immunoisolation in islet transplantation (Elliott RB, 2011). Porcine islets have been used to explore alternative transplant sites, since blood in the portal vein of the liver often contains higher concentrations of immunosuppressants and other toxins, while containing low concentrations of oxygen. Areas of porcine islet transplantation into non-human primates include intraperitoneum, renal subcapsule, subcutaneous, the omentum pouch, and the mesentery (Hering & Walawalkar, 2009).

            "text": "Thus, problems with detection of xenogeneic C-peptide should not be the basis of transplant validation, as soon as normoglycemia is present. Yet, the possible metabolic pathway of xenogeneic C-peptide is speculative; however, it might lay on the root of recipient species' enzymatic activity. \n\nHowever, despite these reports, the authors decided to conduct research using porcine pancreatic islets and demonstrate the functionality of bionic pancreatic constructs. There is a difference in the anatomy of pancreatic islets between species: mice and pigs islets differ in their morphology and distribution of specific cells within an islet [42,43]. However, despite these differences, pig islets are the most anatomically and functionally similar to human islets. Therefore, the authors decided to use them in this study [44]. Moreover, in light of the available studies, it was shown that porcine islets are as functional as mouse islets, so they can be used in studies in a mouse model. Therefore, by providing each mouse with an additional 3000 pancreatic islets, it was expected that the islets in a well-functioning pancreas would be less active. Therefore, the analysis of the C-peptide and glucose levels in fasting mice allowed the determination of the functionality of the bionic scaffolds. Their functionality was demonstrated by decreasing the concentration of mouse C-peptide and lowering glucose levels. The results of glucose and C-peptide measurements confirmed this assumption and thus became another milestone in research into new therapies in T1D (type 1 diabetes) [44][45][46]. \n\nThere is no doubt that pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation is currently the only method of treating people with type 1 diabetes who suffer from severe complications. Islets isolation and transplantation have shown great progress in development in recent years [47]. However, despite intensive progress in the field of transplantation, transplan-tation of pancreatic islets or the entire pancreas is still not an ideal solution. Therefore, transplantology is more and more willing to cooperate with other scientific fields, e.g., tissue engineering using 3D-bioprinting technology from natural polymers [47].",

            "text": "To date, only a limited number of studies have examined the potential beneficial effects of BOECs on porcine islets. Kang and colleagues have demonstrated that the coating of adult pig islets with BOECs results in enhanced vascularization, which in turn leads to improved glycemic control following transplantation into diabetic nude mice [17]. Neonatal porcine islets (NPIs) are the most promising candidate cells for xenotransplantation, as they are easier to isolate than adult islets and demonstrate greater resistance against inflammation and hypoxia [18,19]. A disadvantage of using islet cells from neonatal pigs is that they are immature and require several weeks for maturation after transplantation [6]. Given the importance of neighboring cells in modulating cellular behaviors, the present study analyzed the potential improvement of the NPI cell product by generating 3D spheroids composed of islet cells and BOECs. The findings of this study demonstrate that interactions between islet cells and BOECs enhance islet viability and increase vascularization of transplanted NPIs. Engineering islet-BOEC spheroids may represent an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of porcine islet xenotransplantation.",

New techniques for targeted genomic editing, particularly clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9), offer hope that further genetic manipulation of porcine islets can improve compatibility between host and donor, thus allowing successful control of rejection with previously unfeasible immunosuppression.

Patient blood was circulated through pig kidneys for over an hour before it was returned to the patient's body (Hanson 2011).\n\nGroth's work has inspired other scientists to pursue islet xenograft through animal experimentation and clinical trials. A number of studies have demonstrated that porcine islet xenotransplantation could reverse diabetes in non-human primates for at least 6 months (Hering and Walawalkar 2009;Hering et al. 2006). Islet xenotransplantation clinical trials have also been conducted in several countries including Mexico, Russia, China, New Zealand and Argentina. Some of these trials indicate that islet xenotransplantation reduces the required daily dosage of insulin and the incidence of hypoglycaemia (Torrie 2012). However, in some countries, the development of islet xentransplantation was halted for several years due to public health concerns regarding the risks of infectious diseases. In the next section, I will address the global public controversy over xenotransplantation and proposals for a moratorium on high-risk research.\n\nThe Publics in/and Xenotransplantation: initial responses to the risk of retroviral contagion\n\nIn the early 1990s, the field of xenotransplantation revitalised its research agenda with the announcement of the first transgenic pig in Cambridge, England (Connor 1993). Named Astrid, this pig was produced by British firm, Imutran. Astrid was engineered with a gene-human decay-accelerating factor (or hDAF)-to inhibit immunological rejection of porcine organs and tissues in humans (Rosengard et al. 1995). Two years later, Imutran announced the results from its cardiac xenograft experiments in monkeys. Two out of its ten cynomologus monkeys survived for more than 60 days after their native heart were replaced with a heart from a transgenic pig (Laurance 1995;The Guardian 1995). This news was welcomed by biotechnology industry and positively reported in the media. One journalist equated Imutran's achievement to",

Moreover, longer-term survival will be necessary before broad application of xenotransplantation can be introduced. \n\nFurthermore, other issues require ongoing investigation, such as the imaging studies that are required to accurately size match the donor xenograft (heart) with the recipient to preclude xenograft failure. In addition, ongoing efforts are focused on the prevention of xenozoonoses by establishing closed swine herds within barrier facilities and routine surveillance screening for more than 100 pathogens (such as porcine cytomegalovirus, porcine herpesvirus, porcine coronaviruses, Hepatitis E virus, and others). 2,31,32 n addition, gene editing has been used to disrupt the pol gene of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) although no PERV transmission has been detected in nonhuman primate recipients of porcine xenografts. 2,32 These surveillance measures of potential pathogens involving the donor xenografts and the recipients will be important as the field of xenotransplantation continues to mature.",

These studies informed the design of Revivicor's (Revivicor Inc, Blacksburg, VA) genetically engineered pig with 10 genetic modifications (10 GE) (including the inactivation of 4 endogenous porcine genes and insertion of 6 human transgenes) whose hearts and kidneys have now been studied in preclinical human xenotransplantation models using brain-dead recipients. Additionally, the first two clinical cases of pig-to-human heart xenotransplantation were recently performed using hearts from this 10 GE pig at the University of Maryland. While this review focuses on xenotransplantation of hearts and kidneys, multiple organs, tissues, and cell-types from genetically engineered pigs will provide much-needed therapeutic interventions in the future.",

            "text": "The field of xenotransplantation has been progressing rapidly with many breakthrough achievements in recent years. However, there are still several problems ahead of its use in clinical practice: (i) although porcine-to-human xenotransplantation of kidneys and hearts have been carried out, it is not known when xenotransplantation of liver, small intestine, and even pancreas will become possible. (ii) NHPs are phylogenetically close to humans and share many physiological, anatomical, immunological, and neurological similarities, making them excellent experimental models for research (279). However, there are still differences between species, and it is not clear to which extent studies in NHPs can fully predict xenorejection and the clinical outcome in humans. (iii) Until now, the survival of transplanted organs on the long term largely depends on high doses of different immunosuppressants, which would expose the recipients to high infection risks and other side effects. Although more and more genetically engineered pigs are created by geneediting technologies, the question remains as to whether it will become possible to achieve long-time survival without immunosuppressants, by reducing the immunogenicity of the transgenic donors. Ethical aspects of xenotransplantation have been discussed for many years (280), with particular considerations on issues related to the risks for patient with xenograft do develop and propagate porcine infections (281). (iv) While CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing can remove the PERV gene from pig, the risk of xenozoonosis with other roseoloviruses remains (282). For example, porcine cytomegalovirus was the cause of a significant reduction of the survival time of the transplanted pig organs (283). However, such concerns can also be appropriately handled with modern drug therapies, selective breeding, and genetic modification.\n\nAs allotransplantation is restricted due to cell and organ shortage, xenograft provides an alternative source of tissues, and xenotransplantation may represent the next revolution in medicine. More patients with end-organ failure would undoubtedly benefit from breaking the immunological barriers to xenotransplantation in near future.",

The restoration and maintenance of normoglycemia due to islet graft function was demonstrated by islet-deficient pancreata of recipients and recurrence of the diabetic state upon removal of the graft-bearing chamber. In addition, rat C-peptide was detectable during the implantation period and disappeared from minipig serum immediately after explantation. A second group of animals were followed for a prolonged time period. In these animals, the BW increased by 65% over 70 days period following transplantation. Although the initially transplanted islet mass of 6,2706700 IEQ/kg BW is approximately 20% of islet mass reported in other xenotransplant models [6], it was effective in restoring glycemic control in the recipient animals. However, as BW steadily increased, the nominal dose decreased and eventually impacted the blood glucose levels. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the recipient's pancreas was almost depleted of beta-cells and that islet graft was morphologically intact with intense insulin staining. Therefore, graft failure was not likely a consequence of islet regeneration, immune rejection, or insufficient nutrient/oxygen supply.\n\nXenotransplantation using pig islets is considered to be a potential solution for the shortage of human organs and for the treatment of diabetes [30]. The designated pathogen free (DPF) status of donor pigs, however, cannot be attained for endogenous viruses, such as porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) as they are integrated into the genome. Despite intensive research, preclinical studies were unable to demonstrate PERV or PERV/C transmission to human cells [31]. Nevertheless, the immune barrier described herein adds another layer of confidence to the safety in xenotransplantation of islets.\n\nFor humans with type 1 diabetes (in whom a total of 300,000-500,000 IEQ is required for glycemic control), implantation of 2 devices with the dimensions of the devices described herein (albeit, with higher surface density) may be required. Another potential approach includes the implantation of an elliptically-designed device (186110670 mm in",

WT and \u03b11,3\u2010galactosyltransferase knockout (GTKO) neonatal porcine islets were studied in nonimmunosuppressed rhesus macaques. Inert polyethylene microspheres served as a control for the effects of portal embolization. Digital analysis of immunohistochemistry targeting IBMIR mediators was performed at 1 and 24 h after intraportal islet infusion. Early findings observed in transplanted islets include complement and antibody deposition, and infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages and platelets. Insulin, complement, antibody, neutrophils, macrophages and platelets were similar between GTKO and WT islets, with increasing macrophage infiltration at 24 h in both phenotypes. This model provides an objective and internally controlled study of distinct islet preparations and documents the temporal histology of IBMIR.",

Similarly, correcting for species incompatibilities between porcine and primate complement regulatory systems through individual insertion of human complement regulatory proteins may not significantly reduce the incidence of IBMIR (44). However, combining carbohydrate antigen gene knockouts with complement regulatory transgenes proves additive: xenogeneic islets from GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 and GalTKO.hCD39.hCD46 source pigs demonstrated reduced islet loss and attenuated IBMIR (15, 16).

As such, there is a continued need for pancreatic organs or tissue, which cannot be met with the current supply [66]. \n\nSome success has been shown using the xenotransplantation of islets. This was first carried out in 1994, where 10 type 1 diabetic patients with a kidney transplant (and, therefore, immune suppression) received porcine pancreatic tissue. Porcine C-peptide was detected for 200-400 days in the urine of four patients [75]. Interestingly, another case study demonstrated that in a patient with type 1 diabetes who underwent porcine islet transplantation, live cells were found and retrieved 9.5 years following the transplant, with insulin production being confirmed in in vitro glucose stimulation [76]. Therefore, while xenotransplantation shows potential, the use of blastocyst complementation provides a unique opportunity, as it allows for a decreased need for immune suppression and may increase overall functionality. \n\nKobayashi et al. were some of the first to demonstrate success with blastocyst complementation back in 2010 [19]. They first demonstrated that blastocyst complementation could be used for organ generation. Using a Pdx1 \u2212/\u2212 blastocyst, they developed a niche for pancreas development. Mouse iPSCs or ESCs were then injected, which led to morphologically and histologically normal pancreas generation, with pancreatic islets, duct epithelia and exocrine tissue being entirely derived from the mouse donor cells. However, as with other organs, stromal elements such as vessels, fibrocytes or nerves showed a mix of host and donor cells. Functionally, glucose tolerance testing showed successful insulin secretion in response to glucose with the maintenance of normal glucose levels.",

            "text": "Most islet xenotransplantation laboratories have focused on porcine islets, which are both costly and difficult to isolate. Teleost (bony) fish, such as tilapia, possess macroscopically visible distinct islet organs called Brockmann bodies which can be inexpensively harvested. When transplanted into diabetic nude mice, tilapia islets maintain long\u2010term normoglycemia and provide human\u2010like glucose tolerance profiles. Like porcine islets, when transplanted into euthymic mice, they are rejected in a CD4 T\u2010cell\u2010dependent manner. However, unlike pigs, tilapia are so phylogenetically primitive that their cells do not express \u03b1(1,3)Gal and, because tilapia are highly evolved to live in warm stagnant waters nearly devoid of dissolved oxygen, their islet cells are exceedingly resistant to hypoxia, making them ideal for transplantation within encapsulation devices. Encapsulation, especially when combined with co\u2010stimulatory blockade, markedly prolongs tilapia islet xenograft survival in small animal recipients, and a collaborator has shown function in diabetic cynomolgus monkeys. In anticipation of preclinical xenotransplantation studies, we have extensively characterized tilapia islets (morphology, embryologic development, cell biology, peptides, etc.) and their regulation of glucose homeostasis. Because tilapia insulin differs structurally from human insulin by 17 amino acids, we have produced transgenic tilapia whose islets stably express physiological levels of humanized insulin and have now bred these to homozygosity. These transgenic fish can serve as a platform for further development into a cell therapy product for diabetes.",

However, there are several challenges that hinder the widespread use of islet transplantation, such as a shortage of donor organs, ischemic conditions at the transplantation site, and immune reactions to foreign islets [6,7]. \n\nTo address these problems, two main directions of research are being developed: increasing the number of islets [8][9][10] or finding new sources of insulin-producing cells [11][12][13][14], including the promising application of islet xenotransplantation [11,[15][16][17][18][19], and improving transplantation efficiency through alternative sites [12], enhanced oxygen delivery to transplanted islets [20], the use of drugs to increase beta cell activity [21], or the use of decellularized matrices to support islets [12,22]. In parallel, studies on new immunological approaches [23] and the development of innovative encapsulation methods for immunoisolation [24] are being carried out. \n\nAnimal islets serve as models for research and alternative insulin sources, with the donors primarily being mice, rats, pigs, and primates [25][26][27][28]. While rats and mice are common in studies [29], primates closely model human diabetes [18,30], and pigs are used both in research and clinically, particularly in xenotransplantation techniques developed in Asian countries [11,15,17,31,32]. However, the use of rabbits is rare in modern studies of type 1 diabetes. \n\nRabbits have been used in laboratory research on type 1 diabetes and islet isolation, but to a much more limited extent compared to other animals.

            "text": "slet transplantation promises to provide safe, longlasting insulin independence to individuals with diabetes. Yet the need for lifelong immunosuppression coupled with a vastly insufficient supply of donor tissue continues to prevent the widespread application of this approach to treating diabetes. A study (1) in this issue of Diabetes describes significant progress in addressing both of these issues. \n\nPorcine islets have long been touted as a potentially unlimited source of transplantable islet tissue. Porcine and human insulin are highly homologous, and until the late 1970s, with the advent of recombinant protein technology, porcine insulin was routinely injected into humans with diabetes. However, the transplantation of porcine tissue has not proven to be so straightforward. Over the past decade, nonhuman primate studies demonstrated that a strong immunosuppression protocol was required to avoid rejection of porcine islet xenografts (2,3). Consequently, although the use of porcine islets would overcome the issue of tissue supply, their use would be tantamount to patients trading insulin injections for strong immunosuppression-not an attractive clinical solution for many. \n\nIn the current study, Klymiuk et al. (1) developed transgenic pigs that express an immunomodulatory fusion protein under the control of the insulin promoter. These animals produce the immunosuppressant protein locally upon activation of the insulin promoter within b-cells, but do not appear systemically immunosuppressed, thereby curbing potential complications arising from increased susceptibility of these animals to infections. The fusion protein used in these experiments, LEA29Y, inhibits T-cell activation by preventing costimulation signals from antigen-presenting cells (4). Under the trade name NULOJIX (belatacept), LEA29Y was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult kidney transplant recipients (5), making the transgenic pigs described by Klymiuk et al. of particular clinical relevance. \n\nThe authors chose to evaluate how neonatal islet tissue grafts from LEA-tg pigs developed and functioned following transplantation into diabetic mice.",

            "text": "Background Islet xenotransplantation may be a therapeutic option in type 1 diabetes. Recent advances in generating genetically modified source pigs offer advantages as immune suppressants can potentially be eliminated after the transplantation. Therapy monitoring would greatly benefit from noninvasive methods for assessing the viability of transplanted islets. Peptide-based positron emission tomography (PET) targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) expression on beta cells may offer a procedure that can directly be translated from an experimental setting to the clinic. The aim of this study was to establish the labeling of the GLP1R ligand [68Ga]Ga-exendin-4, to demonstrate the feasibility to image porcine islet xenografts in vivo, and to compare signal quality for three different transplantation sites in a mouse model. Methods Mice with engrafted neonatal porcine islet cell clusters (NPICCs) under the kidney capsule, into the inguinal fold, or the lower hindlimb muscle were studied. After reaching normoglycemia, the mice were injected with [68Ga]Ga-exendin-4 for PET data acquisition. Subsequent autoradiography (AR) was used for comparing ex vivo data with in vivo uptake. Results NPICCs in the lower right hindlimb muscle could be detected in vivo and in AR. Due to the high background in kidney and urinary bladder, islets could not be detected in the PET data at transplantation sites close to these organs, while AR showed a clear signal for the islets in the inguinal fold. Conclusion PET with [68Ga]Ga-exendin-4 detects islets transplanted in the hindlimb muscle tissue of mice, offering the potential of longitudinal monitoring of viable porcine islets. Other sites are not suitable for in vivo imaging owing to high activity accumulation of Exendin-4 in kidney and bladder.",

However, in 2016 only 19,061 kidney transplantations were performed in the US, indicating the increasing gap between supply and demand, and the figures for heart transplantations were 3191 versus 3994 (https://www.unos.org/). Xenotransplantation could help to overcome this shortage. Another field where xenotransplantation may have an enormous impact on public health is the treatment of diabetes. In 2012, 29.1 million Americans, or 9.3% of the population, had diabetes, among them approximately 1.25 million children and adults with type 1 diabetes (http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/ statistics/). Although the treatment of diabetes type 1 with insulin was quite successful in the past using pig insulin and only recently recombinant human insulin, complications were often observed, mainly due to insufficient compliance of the patients leading to limb amputation and blindness. The total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2012 was 245 billion dollars, most of which was spent on the treatment of complications while expenditure for insulin was relatively low. A biologically regulated system based on porcine islet cells would help avoid these complications [5]. Xenotransplantation therefore has the potential to have an enormous impact on public health.",

Morel Transplant Unit, Department of Surgery, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland Porcine pancreases are considered as a suitable source of islets for future use in xenotransplantation, because of the similarity between human and porcine insulin. However, mass isolation of porcine islets remains a real challenge, because of the important fragility of pig islets. Transplantation in a large animal model should provide an adequate support to better assess the feasibility of pig islet isolation and transplantation. Method: Islets were isolated from pancreases of slaughterhouse pigs (age 5-8 month), using a modified automated method. From one pancreas we obtained a mean + SD of 115'000 + 57'107 purified islets. The islets were transplanted by intraportal embolisati0n into the liver of surgically panereatectomized pigs. Each recipient was transplanted with islets pooled from 3 donors, which represents a number of purified islets ranging from 205'000 to 667'000\"(6'949 to 29'000 islets/kg body weight of the recipient). Study gTOUpS: In group (N=6), the recipients did not receive any immunosuppression. In group 2 (N=4) an immunosuppressive treatment of CsA (6 mg/kg/d) and Azathioprine (5 mg/kg/d) was administred by intra-venous (N=3) or intra-muscular (N=I) route, until rejection. The daily monitoring consisted of plasma glucose and insulin measurements. Liver biopsies were performed after recurrence of hyperglycemia and analysed for histology and immunohistological staining for insulin. Results: Groap 1: Insulin secretion was observed for a mean of 4.8 days (range 2 to 11 days) after transplantation.

            "text": "We developed macrodevices encapsulating porcine islets in a highly stable and permeable alginate gel and biocompatible  semipermeable membrane bags and intraperitoneally transplanted them into immunocompetent wild-type diabetic mice in this study. Some important results were obtained. First, long-term glycemic control was achieved in immunocompetent diabetic mice, despite discordant xenotransplantations without the use of immunosuppressants (Figures 3C and 3E). Furthermore, after relay-transplantation into a second diabetic mouse, the glycemic control was also improved (Figures 4A and 4B). Thus, our new device is unprecedented in its ability to resist discordant xenogeneic biological reactions twice. The reason for relay-transplantation in this study was not to reuse the graft, but to evaluate its function under the severe conditions of two transplantations. As shown in Figures 3I and 3J, the GSIS from 0.5% CCAG devices encapsulating 10,000 IEQ of porcine islets 178-214 days after transplantation was reduced to about 5% (1/ 20) compared with the GSIS from 50 mL-0.5% CCAG devices encapsulating 10,000 IEQ of porcine islets before transplantation. This suggests that about 500 IEQ islets survived. The death of many porcine islets in the device early after transplantation to mice was expected, but the fact that the islets survived for a long time probably contributed substantially to the decrease in blood glucose levels. The device was able to be retrieved because no adhesion or fibrosis occurred in the abdominal cavity of the mice over an extended period of time. Therefore, it was possible to quantify the survival rate of porcine islets as insulin secretion from the whole device. In addition, unlike those from neonatal or juvenile porcine islets or pluripotent stem cells, adult porcine islets do not differentiate in vivo when transplanted. Hence, the amount of insulin secreted by individual islets does not increase and it will thus reflect the islet survival rate.",

            "text": "Pig islet xenotransplantation is a potential treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes. Current efforts are focused on identifying the optimal pig islet source and overcoming the immunological barrier. The optimal age of the pig donors remains controversial since both adult and neonatal pig islets have advantages. Isolation of adult islets using GMP grade collagenase has significantly improved the quantity and quality of adult islets, but neonatal islets can be isolated at a much lower cost. Certain culture media and coculture with mesenchymal stromal cells facilitate neonatal islet maturation and function. Genetic modification in pigs affords a promising strategy to prevent rejection. Deletion of expression of the three known carbohydrate xenoantigens (Gal, Neu5Gc, Sda) will certainly be beneficial in pig organ transplantation in humans, but this is not yet proven in islet transplantation, though the challenge of the \u20184th xenoantigen\u2019 may prove problematic in nonhuman primate models. Blockade of the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway leads to long-term islet graft survival (of up to 965 days). Anti-CD40mAbs have already been applied in phase II clinical trials of islet allotransplantation. Fc region-modified anti-CD154mAbs successfully prevent the thrombotic complications reported previously. In this review, we discuss (I) the optimal age of the islet-source pig, (ii) progress in genetic modification of pigs, (iii) the immunosuppressive regimen for pig islet xenotransplantation, and (iv) the reduction in the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction.",

Our recent study showed that the isolated porcine islets were >90% pure, contained >80% healthy \u03b2-cells, and had >60% diabetes correction capacity, each demonstrated by dithizone staining, FACS analysis, and NOD/SCID bioassay, respectively [26].

Porcine islets function similarly to human islets, and historically, humans were treated with purified porcine insulin until recombinant human insulin became available. However, one concern with the use of pigs as islet donors is the presence of many dormant porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which could pose a risk to recipients. Using CRISPR-Cas9, all 62 copies of the PERV pol gene were inactivated, resulting in a >1,000-fold reduction in PERV transmission to human cells 9 , and PERVinactivated pigs were successfully generated, addressing this safety concern for clinical application of porcine-to-human xenotransplantation 10 . Genome editing can also be used to reduce the expression of antigens that typically promote aggressive immune responses to xenografts.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation using pig tissues and organs is under development in order to alleviate the increasing shortage of human transplants. Since xenotransplantation may be associated with the transmission of porcine microorganisms to the human recipient, the donor pigs should be carefully analyzed, especially for the presence of potentially zoonotic viruses. G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs (G\u00f6MP) are potential donors of islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Despite the fact that all animals produced at Ellegaard G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs A/S carry porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) in their genome and that very few animals were infected with porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV), no transmission of these viruses was observed in a preclinical trial transplanting G\u00f6MP islet cells into cynomolgus monkeys. Using a new comprehensive strategy, we then analyzed an isolated subpopulation of G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs which remained at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. We concentrated on 11 xenotransplantation-relevant viruses and combined co-incubation assays with susceptible human target cells and molecular biological methods to evaluate the risk posed by PERV. All animals in G\u00f6ttingen carry PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C in their genome but they are not infected with PCMV, PLHV and HEV. The difference may be explained by selection of negative animals and/or de novo infection. The PERV copy number was established using ddPCR (93 copies) and a human-tropic PERV-A/C was found released from PBMCs of one animal with a high expression of PERV-C.",

The rejection of porcine xenotransplantation should be solved before clinical application to human. We also discussed a number of genetic engineered pig models used in xenotransplantation, and several important organs in porcine xenotransplantation. Further research for genetic modification of the organ-source pig will be prosperous. These may be associated with the identification of pig non-Gal antigens that are targets for natural or elicited antibodies, natural killer cells, and/or macrophages. Although genetically-modified pigs have overcome the problem of HAR, coagulation dysregulation between species remains an important challenge. In addition, the risks of the approaches to cell function and to the health of the recipient should be carefully evaluated. It is important to emphasize that the escape from PERV is essential for the complete success of porcine xenotransplantatoin into nonhuman primates before human clinical trials. It is generally recognized that success of xentransplantation into nonhuman primate model should be preceded prior to human clinical application. Therefore, all efforts to solve many obstacles in porcine xenotransplantation should probably be performed.",

The decedent was hemodynamically stable through reperfusion, and vascular integrity was maintained despite the exposure of the xenografts to human blood pressure. No hyperacute rejection was observed, and the kidneys remained viable until termination 74 h later. No chimerism or transmission of porcine retroviruses was detected. Longitudinal biopsies revealed thrombotic microangiopathy that did not progress in severity, without evidence of cellular rejection or deposition of antibody or complement proteins. Although the xenografts produced variable amounts of urine, creatinine clearance did not recover. Whether renal recovery was impacted by the milieu of brain death and/or microvascular injury remains unknown. In summary, our study suggests that major barriers to human xenotransplantation have been surmounted and identifies where new knowledge is needed to optimize xenotransplantation outcomes in humans.",

            "text": "However, multiple studies of devices for the treatment of T1D have been conducted. In these studies, chitosan gel and ethylene-vinyl alcohol devices that encapsulated rat pancreatic islets were transplanted intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into mice. 50,51 he devices were observed only up to 1 month after transplantation, and it is unclear whether long-term function can be maintained. In addition, they involved concordant xenotransplantation in which rat pancreatic islets were transplanted into mice, and the immune response received by the devices differs from that of our transplantation of porcine pancreatic islets into mice, that is, discordant xenotransplantation. Treatment of T1D using xenogeneic islets requires the development of macrodevices that can avoid and resist the immune response of discordant xenotransplantation and maintain device function for a long period of time. \n\nAlthough many studies of alginate gels combining derivatives and ion gelation have been reported, [52][53][54][55][56][57] there are no studies in which the transplanted alginate gel device has functioned in vivo for a long period of time. However, studies have reported that ion-crosslinking azido alginate gels have high physical/chemical stability, [52][53][54] show a low host immune response, and have few foreign reactions and minimal inflammation. 55 In addition, the ion-crosslinking azido alginate gel has good cellular compatibility between human and rat pancreatic islets 52 and exhibits high biological activity in cell adhesion and cell proliferation assays. 56,57 These results support the results of improved long-term transplant outcomes with our device. \n\nIn this study, 10,000 IEQ porcine islets were required to improve blood glucose levels in immunocompetent wild-type diabetes mice (Figure 5D). 9][60] In general, the number of islets required to improve blood glucose levels in mouse diabetes models is species dependent.",

            "text": "Dialysis as a therapy for end-stage kidney failure is life preserving but replaces only a small fraction of normal kidney function and has and considerable morbidity. Kidney allotransplantation provides a higher level of renal function and a less constrained lifestyle. However, it is limited by the number of human organs available [33].\n\nUse of oral hypoglycemic agents and administration of insulin are cornerstones of treatment for diabetes mellitus. However, adequate control of circulating glucose levels cannot be attained by most patients, and attempts at maintaining euglycemia through intensive insulin therapy lead to hypoglycemia. In contrast, allotransplantation therapies (whole pancreas or islets of Langerhans (islets)) can normalize glucose control [1,2]. Given existing technology, a major limitation to the use of either whole pancreas or islet allotransplantation is the insufficient supply of human organs. Compounding this limitation for islet transplantation is the need to transplant large quantities of islets from multiple donors to achieve even short-term insulin sufficiency. Selection criteria at most US centers for pancreas transplantation dictate a conservative approach that excludes most type 2 diabetics, traditionally older and poorer surgical risks than type 1 patients.\n\nWhole pancreas transplantation requires use of potent immunosuppressive medications that have significant complications. Newer, more targeted immunosuppressive regimens that do not require steroid or high-dose calcineurin inhibitors make islet transplantation a more attractive option. However, side effects of immune suppression that must be maintained so long as the graft functions remain a source of morbidity and even mortality [34]. Thus, transplantation therapy for diabetes trades one set of morbidities (associated with diabetes and its medical treatment) for another (associated with immune suppression).\n\nIn that pigs are plentiful and have renal function very similar to humans, and because porcine insulin works well in humans, the pig has been suggested as a kidney or pancreas organ donor for humans with chronic kidney disease or diabetes. While humoral rejection is ameliorated following transplantation into nonhuman primates of kidneys from pigs transgenic for the human complement activator, decay",

Biopsies showed viable islets up to day 14, but not thereafter, with a progressive mononuclear cell and macrophage infiltration. These results suggest that powerful immune responses are involved in rejection of discordant xenogeneic islets and that adequate immunosuppressive regimens still need to be developed.\n\nThe first clinical experience of porcine islet xenotransplantation into human patients was reported by the Swedish group headed by Groth [77]. This surgical team transplanted a total of 10 diabetic patients with porcine islets, but no reduction in insulin requirement was observed in any of them [20]. However, the trial indicated that some xenogeneic islet cells do not appear to be acutely rejected if the patient is receiving pharmacological immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, xenotransplantation of porcine fetal pancreatic tissue into the human can be carried out without morbidity.\n\nEncapsulation of islets has been proposed for preventing rejection of both allo and xeno islets. The principle is that permeability of the capsule membrane is sufficient to allow nutrients and oxygen to reach the islets and for insulin to be released into the bloodstream, but restrictive enough to exclude immune cells and antibodies. Such encapsulation can be achieved using alginate-polylysinealginate capsules. Functional in vitro tests of microencapsulated islets have shown that insulinrelease profiles following glucose stimulation are similar to those of free islets. Microencapsulated islet allo-and xenografts have been implanted successfully in rodents, reversing chemically-induced diabetes [25,78,79]. Porcine encapsulated islets have been reported to induce normoglycaemia in a spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkey (without immunosuppressive therapy) for more than 800 days [80]. Insulin-independence has also been reported for >9 months in an immunosuppressed type 1 diabetic patient transplanted intraperitoneally with encapsulated all",

            "text": "Islet replacement therapies aiming to restore insulin independency in type I diabetic patients need to ensure that transplanted cells from human or animal origin produce enough insulin to sustain the host's physiological needs and establish efficient glucose homeostasis. This is also true even when the therapy's ambitions are limited to improving the patient's quality of life by diminishing exogenous insulin doses or alleviating the risk of severe hypoglycemia as seen in difficult-to-manage brittle diabetes. Surgical and immunological considerations such as the host immune response, implantation site, graft vascularization and its access to nutrients and oxygen as well as its capacity to deliver the secreted hormones all weight in the successful outcome of the procedure but intrinsic secretory properties of the grafted cells remain an undeniably determinant factor. From a qualitative point of view, porcine insulin is almost identical to its human counterpart differing only by one amino acid at position 30 in the B-chain (alanine in pigs vs. threonine in humans) [1]. Quantitatively, insulin secretion from porcine islets is significantly low compared to secretion from human islets in response to the same stimuli [2]. While everybody agrees on this specificity of porcine islets, different strategies have been proposed to overcome this limitation with most research groups resorting to increasing the number of implanted cells to compensate low secretion, promoting cell differentiation and maturation in vitro especially when using neonatal islets or using genetic modifications to improve the secretory capacity of porcine islets as we have recently suggested. In the present review, we briefly summarized our current knowledge of porcine islet physiology, their efficacy in experimental xenotransplantation models with particular emphasis on the development of genetically modified, functionally enhanced islets.",

Most if not all of these genetic modifications of donors are aimed to mitigate immune rejection of grafted cells without the need for radical immunosuppression. Physiological incompatibilities between porcine and human islets need to be taken into consideration and genetic modification of pig beta cells aimed to increase insulin secretion are being investigated with promising results [5\u2022]. Combining these genetic engineering strategies with microbiological selection of animals and pathogen-free breeding as well as cell encapsulation techniques is bringing therapeutic islet xenotransplantation closer than ever to widespread application.",

Montanari et al. cover another strategy that might possibly improve xenograft durability.This approach is represented by the protection offered to hepatocytes by cotransplantation with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (in Beneficial Effects of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells on Porcine Hepatocyte Viability and Albumin Secretion).In fact, alginate-encapsulated hepatocytes demonstrated higher viability and albumin secretion upon coculture with MSCs thanks to the paracrine effect of their secreted cytokines CCL2, CXCL12, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).Such original results are of great interest for the success of cell transplantation in the setting of acute liver failure and once again, confirm the powerful immunomodulatory and protective abilities of MSCs when applied as ancillary therapies or alone.\n\nBesides immune response, other pitfalls in the clinical application of xenotransplantation could be represented by inappropriate organ function and growth adaptation, also developed in the long term.J. A. Shah and colleagues analyze the possible causes of post-transplant proteinuria in preclinical renal xenotransplantation and summarize the preventive strategies that are currently being tested/applied (in Potential Pathways behind Proteinuria as well as Factors Related to Growth Discrepancies following Pig-to-Kidney Xenotransplantation).In addition, they highlight the importance of organ size match since discrepancies may ultimately be a cause of xenograft failure.Lastly, in their review, C.

Ultrastructurally precise kidneys differentiate in situ following xenotransplantation in mesentery of embryonic pig renal primordia. The developing organ attracts its blood supply from the host, obviating humoral rejection. Engraftment of pig renal primordia transplanted directly into rats requires host immune suppression. However, insulin-producing cells originating from embryonic pig pancreas obtained very early following initiation of organogenesis [embryonic day 28 (E28)] engraft long term in nonimmune-suppressed diabetic rats or rhesus macaques. Engraftment of morphologically similar cells originating from adult porcine islets of Langerhans (islets) occurs in rats previously transplanted with E28 pig pancreatic primordia.

            "text": "Islet transplantation (ITx) has established that cellular therapies can improve glycemic control in a subset of patients with type 1 diabetes, but it is limited by the shortage of adequate donor islets and need for chronic immunosuppression [1,2]. Alternatively, other sources of \u00df-cells have been highly sought after, including stem cell-derived \u00df-cells and xenogeneic islet alternatives. Through the recapitulation of pancreatic development, several groups have been able to generate islet-like cells from pluripotent stem cells, and clinical trials have demonstrated C-peptide secretion following transplant of embryonic stem cellderived pancreatic progenitors that mature into islets in vivo, as well as fully differentiated islets [3][4][5]. Despite the success of these trials, the clinical translation of stem cell-derived islets remains limited by the need for cost-efficient cell manufacturing process and, more importantly, concerns over the safety of the cell product due to the teratogenic potential of proliferative off-target cell populations during differentiation [6][7][8][9]. For this reason, xenotransplantation offers a promising alternative as a readily available source of islets for ITx. \n\nThe pig represents the most probable source of islets for xenotransplantation due to its unlimited availability, high breeding potential, large number of offspring, and overall close anatomical and physiological similarity to humans [10]. Moreover, porcine insulin differs by only a single amino acid from that of human insulin, and it was administered to treat diabetes for nearly a century before the introduction of recombinant human insulin, making porcine islets an ideal source for ITx [11]. However, xenozoonoses and xenoantigens were considered major concerns for clinical translation until recently, when two gene-edited pig heart transplants were successfully carried out in living patients [12,13]. In addition, genetically modified pig kidneys have been implanted into two brain-dead human recipients [14].",

            "text": "Successful long-term survival of islet grafts was achieved by Dirk van der Windt and his colleagues through a combination of strategies, including optimized diabetes induction in cynomolgus monkeys, an anti-inflammatory protocol, an immunosuppressive regimen based on an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb), and the use of pig islets expressing the human complement regulator CD46 [44]. This was the first report of pig islet transplantation resulting in insulin-independence and normoglycemia for a period of >12 months (Figure 2). This significant achievement was later replicated using GTKO pig donors that expressed multiple human transgenes targeting complement and coagulation activation and inflammation [46]. It demonstrated the beneficial effects of tissue targeted gene editing in modulating IBMIR and early islet loss, thus advancing the acceptance of genetically-engineered porcine tissues for transplantation. However, in neither study were the results consistently successful. \n\nConducting pre-clinical trials with long-term follow-up enabled the refinement of methodologies for monitoring diabetes in NHPs post-transplantation. Marco Marigliano (Italy) and his colleagues demonstrated that monitoring hemoglobin A1C is a reliable metric for assessing glucose control both before and after islet xenotransplantation [47]. \n\nStandardization of experimental conditions ensured the overall safety of the procedure. However, complications were reported. For example, Nathalie Campanile (Switzerland) reported that, 1 week after intraportal pig islet transplantation, one recipient developed acute gastric dilatation that proved fatal [48]. Acute gastric dilatation had been described before in NHPs and has subsequently proved problematic in baboons after pig organ transplantation. The report by the Pittsburgh group offered guidelines for preventing or managing acute gastric dilatation. \n\nRita Bottino and Angela Criscimanna (Italy) reported interesting findings related to the recovery of beta cell mass and function in NHPs that had been rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and subsequently received porcine islet transplants [49].",

Our approach takes advantage of the unique aspects of the islet macrobead, namely its long-term viability in culture and lack of patient immunosuppression, to limit the microbiological safety risk of porcine islets for transplantation. Essential to our approach is the establishment of four checkpoints that span the macrobead production and transplantation processes. The checkpoint approach is built upon an increasing level of microbiological screening from the donor herd up to the islet product, using multiple assay formats with the ability to screen for known and unknown pathogens. Using the checkpoint approach, we provide evidence to support the use of donor animals housed in high hygienic but not HEPA-filtered environments, not only for islet xenotransplantation but also other xeno-cell therapies. In this study, we present and document the effectiveness of our microbiological safety strategy to minimize the microbiological risks of agarose encapsulated porcine islets for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

            "text": "Xenotransplantation of porcine hearts has become a promising alternative to human allotransplantation, where organ demand still greatly surpasses organ availability. Before entering the clinic, however, feasibility of cardiac xenotransplantation needs to be proven, ideally in the life supporting orthotopic pig-to-nonhuman primate xenotransplantation model. In this review, we shortly outline the last three decades of research and then discuss in detail its most recent advances. These include the genetic modifications of donor pigs to overcome hyperacute rejection and coagulation dysregulation, new organ preservation methods to prevent perioperative xenograft dysfunction, experimental immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies to inhibit the adaptive immune system and systemic inflammation in the recipient, growth control concepts to avoid detrimental overgrowth of the porcine hearts in nonhuman primates, and lastly, the avoidance of porcine cytomegalovirus infections in donor pigs. With these strategies, consistent survival of 6\u20139 months was achieved in the orthotopic xenotransplantation model, thereby fulfilling the prerequisites for the initiation of a clinical trial.",

Pig islet has been shown to regulate blood glucose control in diabetic NHPs. However, due to initial immune responses including IBMIR etc., a large number of islets are destroyed and subsequently the remaining islets can engraft and regulate blood glucose level in the recipients. Among these pre-clinical studies, the proper number of islets required for blood glucose level control in diabetic NHPs has not been reported. Here, we measure the number of islets present in small biopsy liver samples from NHPs underwent porcine islet transplantation and correlate its number with blood glucose levels during follow-up periods. Method Pig islets were isolated from designated pathogen-free SNU miniature pigs and transplanted via a portal vein into streptozotocin-induced diabetic monkeys (Rhesus macaque). After transplantation, 42 biopsies were performed from 29 NHPs. The experimental group was divided into three groups; normoglycemia (about 100-150 mg/dl), intermediate hyperglycemia (150-250 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (more than 250 mg/dl) according to blood glucose levels. To measure the number of transplanted islets, a biopsy of the distal portion of the liver was performed and the biopsied samples were stained with anti-insulin antibodies. Also, semi-quantitative histological and statistical analyses were conducted. Result Pig islets were positively stained with anti-insulin antibody in the liver samples from the recipient NHPs. The number of stained islets per cm2 was measured in liver section, with its number ranging from 0 to 26.6. The values was 3.89-26.6, 1.18-3.77, and 0-2.53 in the normoglycemia, intermediate hyperglycemia, and hyperglycemia group, respectively. Importantly, islet number in the liver section was negatively correlated to the level of fasting blood glucose at the day of biopsy and this relationship is highly significant (Figure 1). Conclusion The number of islets present in small biopsy liver samples is significantly correlated with blood glucose level in islet recipient NHPs. This finding suggests that islet number in the small liver biopsy samples can represent engrafted islet mass and thus be potentially one of parameters to predict the outcome of islet transplantation.

Induction therapy consisted of either basiliximab (n = 6) or rhesus\u2010specific anti\u2010thymocyte globulin (rhATG, n = 6), combined with a maintenance regimen using B7 costimulation blockade, tacrolimus with a delayed transition to sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Xenografts were monitored by blood glucose levels and porcine C\u2010peptide measurements. Of the six receiving basiliximab induction, engraftment was achieved in 4 with median graft survival of 14 days. All six receiving rhATG induction engrafted with significantly longer xenograft survival at 40.5 days (P = 0.03). These data suggest that depletional induction provides superior xenograft survival to nondepletional induction, in the setting of a costimulation blockade\u2010based maintenance regimen.",

Induction therapy consisted of either basiliximab (n = 6) or rhesus\u2010specific anti\u2010thymocyte globulin (rhATG, n = 6), combined with a maintenance regimen using B7 costimulation blockade, tacrolimus with a delayed transition to sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Xenografts were monitored by blood glucose levels and porcine C\u2010peptide measurements. Of the six receiving basiliximab induction, engraftment was achieved in 4 with median graft survival of 14 days. All six receiving rhATG induction engrafted with significantly longer xenograft survival at 40.5 days (P = 0.03). These data suggest that depletional induction provides superior xenograft survival to nondepletional induction, in the setting of a costimulation blockade\u2010based maintenance regimen.",

Some of this deficit is being met by the use of organs or partial organs from living donors, but this source is insufficient. Xenotransplantation-the transplantation of organs between species, namely from the pig to human-could provide a solution if immunologic and other associated problems could be solved. When a pig organ is transplanted into a primate, hyperacute rejection, induced by anti-pig antibody and mediated by complement and the coagulation system, develops rapidly. This immediate problem can now be overcome, but the return or persistence of anti-pig antibody leads to a delayed form of humoral rejection, acute humoral xenograft rejection, which leads to destruction of the organ within days or weeks. We review the various approaches being investigated to overcome this barrier. Whether they will also prevent subsequent acute cellular rejection remains unknown. Brief mention is made of the potential physiologic incompatibilities between pig and human organs, as well as the microbiologic safety aspects of xenotransplantation. Finally, the question of patient and societal acceptance of xenotransplantation is discussed."

The first 14 patients were treated with cyclosporine (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolon, and porcine C-peptide was not monitored, the following 2 patients were given cyklosporin and MMF only, while the next 6 patients were given a quadruple drug regimen consisting of OKT3, takrolimus, sirolimus and prednisolon. The blood glucose levels,exogenous insulin requirement,HbA1c, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and liver function were assessed before and after NPI transplantation. The serum porcine C peptide were monitored in last 8 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe first 14 patients required less insulin and the HbA1c dropped after the transplantation. In the 2 subsequent patients, the metabolic parameters remained unchanged and monitor of porcine C-peptide was negative. Insulin requirements were reduced in all 6 patients, and HbA1c was normalized 3 months after the transplantation. Significant levels of porcine C-peptide were detected in the patient serum. Two of the patients were given a second injection of NPIs, and one of them became insulin independent for 7 d. No serious adverse events were noted after the transplantation. There was no evidence of PERV transmission. Six out of the 22 patients were followed up for 4-6 years after the NPIs injection, immunosuppressive treatment was stopped 1 year after the transplantation. The patients started to take insulin at the time of follow up. Four patients restricted the intake of sugar, while the other 2 did not. One patient had ketoacidosis twice and slight diabetic retinopathy, and another patient had ketoacidosis induced by acute gastroenteritis. The remaining 4 patients did not have any complications.

Some studies use fluorodopa uptake on positron-emission tomography (PET) as a marker of graft viability, but fluorodopa uptake does not distinguish between host and grafted neurons. There has been no direct evidence that grafts of fetal tissue can survive and innervate the striatum.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe studied a 59-year-old man with advanced Parkinson's disease who received bilateral grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue in the postcommissural putamen. The tissue came from seven embryos between 6 1/2 and 9 weeks after conception. The patient died 18 months later from a massive pulmonary embolism. The brain was studied with the use of tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemical methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter transplantation, the patient had sustained improvement in motor function and a progressive increase in fluorodopa uptake in the putamen on PET scanning. On examination of the brain, each of the large grafts appeared to be viable. Each was integrated into the host striatum and contained dense clusters of dopaminergic neurons. Processes from these neurons had grown out of the grafts and provided extensive dopaminergic reinnervation to the striatum in a patch-matrix pattern. Ungrafted regions of the putamen showed sparse dopaminergic innervation. We could not identify any sprouting of host dopaminergic processes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGrafts of fetal mesencephalic tissue can survive for a long period in the human brain and restore dopaminergic innervation to the striatum in patients with Parkinson's disease. In the patient we studied, clinical improvement and enhanced fluorodopa with uptake on PET scanning were associated the survival of the grafts and dopaminergic reinnervation of the striatum."

As juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, we analyzed the distribution of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development to propose an appropriate age cut-off for islet isolation from the juvenile porcine pancreas [43].

The pig may potentially be an unlimited source of organs for patients with diabetes, although the appropriate age for islet isolation is not known. As juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, we analyzed the distribution of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development to propose an appropriate age cut-off for islet isolation from the juvenile porcine pancreas [43]. We found that the isolation of porcine pancreatic islets approximately 35 d after birth may offer benefits with regard to their xenotransplantation potential. Further research into the optimal timeline for islet isolation is being conducted in DPF pigs generated at our research center."

However, nephrotic syndrome emerged as a complication in which the glomeruli showed mild mesangial expansion with similarities to minimal change disease (MCD) in humans. Since MCD is associated with CD80 expression in glomeruli and elevated urinary excretion, we evaluated a potential role for CD80 in xenograft nephropathy. Study 1 confirmed high urinary CD80 excretion in nephrotic animals with renal xenografts showing CD80 expression in glomeruli. In Study 2, baboons receiving xenografts received CTLA4\u2010Ig once a week from the second postoperative week or no CTLA4\u2010Ig. The non\u2010CTLA4\u2010Ig group developed severe proteinuria with modest mesangial expansion with high urinary excretion of CD80 and documented CD80 expression in glomerular podocytes. All of the recipients in non\u2010CTLA4\u2010Ig groups had to be euthanized before POD 60. In contrast, CTLA4\u2010Ig group showed a marked reduction in proteinuria and survived significantly longer, up to 193 days.

These studies suggested that CD4+ T cells may have a more prominent role in xenograft rejection compared with CD8+ T cells. Although animals that received selective depletion of CD8+ T cells showed signs of early cellular rejection (marked CD4+ infiltrates), animals receiving selective CD4+ depletion exhibited normal biopsy results until late, when signs of chronic antibody rejection were present. In vitro study results suggested that rhesus CD4+ T cells required the presence of SLA class II to mount an effective proliferative response.

However, the shortage of islet donors limits its\u2019 broad application. Porcine islet xenotransplantation presents a solution to the donor shortage and recent advances in genetic modification and immunosuppressive regimens provide renewed enthusiasm for the potential of this treatment. Recent findings Advances in genetic editing technology are leading to multigene modified porcine islet donors with alterations in expression of known xenoantigens, modifications of their complement and coagulation systems, and modifications to gain improved immunological compatibility. Recent NHP-based trials of costimulation blockade using CD154 blockade show promising improvements in islet survival, whereas results targeting CD40 are less consistent. Furthermore, trials using IL-6 receptor antagonism have yet to demonstrate improvement in glucose control and suffer from poor graft revascularization. Summary This review will detail the current status of islet xenotransplantation as a potential treatment for type I diabetes mellitus, focusing on recent advances in porcine xenogeneic islet production, assessment in nonhuman primate preclinical models, the outcome of human clinical trials and review barriers to translation of xenoislets to the clinic."

One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted (Vald\u00e9s\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2010)...In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24.",

We investigated whether the transgenic expression of a human complement\u2010regulatory protein (hCD46) on porcine islets would improve the outcome of islet xenotransplantation in streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys. Immunosuppression consisted of thymoglobulin, anti\u2010CD154 mAb for costimulation blockade, and mycophenolate mofetil. Following the transplantation of islets from wild\u2010type pigs (n = 2) or from 1,3\u2010galactosyltransferase gene\u2010knockout pigs (n = 2), islets survived for a maximum of only 46 days, as evidenced by return to hyperglycemia and the need for exogenous insulin therapy. The transplantation of islets from hCD46 pigs resulted in graft survival and insulin\u2010independent normoglycemia in four of five monkeys for the 3 months follow\u2010up of the experiment. One normalized recipient, selected at random, was followed for >12 months. Inhibition of complement activation by the expression of hCD46 on the pig islets did not substantially reduce the initial loss of islet mass, rather was effective in limiting antibody\u2010mediated rejection. This resulted in a reduced need for immunosuppression to preserve a sufficient islet mass to maintain normoglycemia long\u2010term.",

Although galactose\u2010\u03b11,3\u2010galactose, the gal epitope, has emerged as the principal target of rejection in pig\u2010to\u2010primate models of solid organ transplant, the importance of gal\u2010specific immunity in islet xenotransplant models has yet to be clearly demonstrated. Here, we directly compare the immunogenicity, survival and function of neonatal porcine islets (NPIs) from gal\u2010expressing wild\u2010type (WT) or gal\u2010deficient galactosyl transferase knockout (GTKO) donors. Paired diabetic rhesus macaques were transplanted with either WT (n = 5) or GTKO (n = 5) NPIs. Recipient blood glucose, transaminase and serum xenoantibody levels were used to monitor response to transplant. Four of five GTKO versus one of five WT recipients achieved insulin\u2010independent normoglycemia; transplantation of WT islets resulted in significantly greater transaminitis. The WT NPIs were more susceptible to antibody and complement binding and destruction\u2002in vitro. Our results confirm that gal is an important variable in xenoislet transplantation. The GTKO NPI recipients have improved rates of normoglycemia, likely due to decreased susceptibility of xenografts to innate immunity mediated by complement and preformed xenoantibody. Therefore, the use of GTKO donors is an important step toward improved consistency and interpretability of results in future xenoislet studies."

However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models (Itoh et al., 2019) . Itoh et al. (Itoh et al., 2019) recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

However, small animal models are not sufficient to evaluate large-sized products for human use. Thus, an immunodeficient large animal model is necessary in order to properly evaluate the clinical efficacy of human-derived tissue-engineered products, such as artificial grafts. Here we report the development of an immunodeficient pig model, the operational immunodeficient pig (OIDP), by surgically removing the thymus and spleen, and creating a controlled immunosuppressive protocol using a combination of drugs commonly used in the clinical setting. We find that this model allows the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts. The development of the OIDP is an essential step towards a comprehensive and clinically relevant evaluation of human cell regeneration strategies at the preclinical stage. The development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts heavily relies on the availability of large animal models that allow long-term assessment of graft patency. Here Itoh et al. propose a novel model of immunodeficient pigs that allows long-term accommodation of human cell-derived three-dimensional bioprinted vascular tubes."

However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models (Itoh et al., 2019) . Itoh et al. (Itoh et al., 2019) recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue."

This disease can be treated by either insulin injection or islet transplantation. Islet transplantation is considered as a better treatment for T1D patients, because islets can produce and release insulin at the appropriate time, resulting in tight blood glucose control. However, islet transplantation is performed only for brittle T1D patients due to lack of sufficient donors: only 1 of 333 patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can obtain human islets (Frank et al., 2005). Porcine insulin has been applied to treat T1D. Recently, pig islets have also proved to be an attractive alternative resource for solving the donor shortage issue for islet transplantation. Many preclinical trials of porcine islet transplantation have been performed and have already achieved long-term survival of porcine islets in primate recipients (Cardona et al., 2006; Bottino et al., 2014). Previous efforts have been focusing on overcoming rejection of recipients to the donor organs (Bottino et al., 2014). Porcine insulin differs from human insulin by one amino acid (alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) at the carboxy-terminal of the B chain (i.e. position B30) (Sonnenberg and Berger, 1983) (Supplementary Figure S1). This single amino acid difference can induce human antibodies to act against porcine insulin. As a result, the effectiveness is decreased when porcine insulin is used for the longterm treatment of diabetic patients (Clark et al., 1982). For the same reason, the transferred pig islets may not function well in human patients for a long period. To address this issue, here we attempt to generate genetically humanized pigs that produce human insulin rather than porcine insulin. We edited porcine INS (pINS) gene in fibroblasts by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or CRISPR/Cas9, combined with singlestranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) as homology donors. By using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, we successfully generated the genetically modified pigs exclusively expressing human insulin. Gene-editing animals have been generated by injecting the mRNA or proteins of custom endonuclease (such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALEN, and Cas9/gRNA) into one-cell stage embryos, which mostly resulted in mosaicism of the modification. In addition, the genotypes generated by embryo microinjection are variable and unpredictable (Crispo et al., 2015). One or two rounds of further breeding should be performed to obtain desired homozygotes with identical genotype and phenotype, which is particularly time and labor consuming for large animals with long gestation term and sex maturation age, such as pigs. To address this issue, our group has established an approach that employs gene-targeting somatic cells with SCNT, which could generate gene-editing animals with a single and identical mutation by one round of SCNT experiment. Recent reports have demonstrated that ssODNs, which are easily available, are more effective donors than traditional double-strand DNA homology for homology-directed repair (HDR), with the aid of custom endonucleases such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 (Bedell et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). In addition, when ssODNs are used as HDR donors, selection marker gene is not necessary, which enables to create seamless sitespecific mutations. The success of ssODN-mediated targeting strategy has been reported in cell lines or early stage embryos, but not yet in somatic cells, where homologous recombination with ssODNs is expected to be more difficult due to the limited proliferation competency. The length of ssODNs may affect the HDR efficiency in somatic cells. To optimize the length of ssODNs as donors, a HEK293 cell line with a fluorescence reporter was established, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was mutated by deleting T at 456 site (DEGFP), and thus a stop codon (TATA.TA-A) was created to prevent the EGFP expression. Seven ssODNs with different lengths were used as donors, combined with either TALENs or Cas9/gRNA, to repair DEGFP (Supplementary Figure S2A). Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the repairing efficiency (Supplementary Figures S2B and S3). We found that the repairing efficiency increased when the length of ssODNs ranged from (0 + 0) nt to (25 + 25) nt and remarkably decreased when the length of ssODNs reached (30 + 30) nt. However, the repairing efficiency increased again when the length of ssODNs increased from (30 + 30) nt (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S3). It had been reported that when short ssODNs of 15 2 25 nt were used as donors, an alternative genome repair mechanism, i.e. microhomology-mediated end 174 | Journal of Molecular Cell Biology (2016), 8(2), 174\u2013177 doi:10.1093/jmcb/mjw008"

The prevailing treatment for T1DM involves daily subcutaneous insulin injections, but a substantial proportion of patients face challenges such as severe hypoglycemic episodes and poorly controlled hyperglycemia. For T1DM patients, a more effective therapeutic option involves the replacement of \u03b2\u2010cells through allogeneic transplantation of either the entire pancreas or isolated pancreatic islets. Unfortunately, the scarcity of transplantable human organs has led to a growing list of patients waiting for an islet transplant. One potential alternative is xenotransplantation of porcine pancreatic islets. However, due to inter\u2010species molecular incompatibilities, porcine tissues trigger a robust immune response in humans, leading to xenograft rejection. Several promising strategies aim to overcome this challenge and enhance the long\u2010term survival and functionality of xenogeneic islet grafts. These strategies include the use of islets derived from genetically modified pigs, immunoisolation of islets by encapsulation in biocompatible materials, and the creation of an immunomodulatory microenvironment by co\u2010transplanting islets with accessory cells or utilizing immunomodulatory biomaterials.

Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy."

                            "Dear Editor, Type1 diabetes (T1D) is a lifelong (chronic) disease and a majorhealth problem throughout the world. This disease can be treated by either insulin injection or islet transplantation. Islet transplantation is considered as a better treatment for T1D patients, because islets can produce and release insulin at the appropriate time, resulting in tight blood glucose control. However, islet transplantation is performed only for brittle T1D patients due to lack of sufficient donors: only 1 of 333 patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can obtain human islets (Frank et al., 2005). Porcine insulin has been applied to treat T1D. Recently, pig islets have also proved to be an attractive alternative resource for solving the donor shortage issue for islet transplantation. Many preclinical trials of porcine islet transplantation have been performed and have already achieved long-term survival of porcine islets in primate recipients (Cardona et al., 2006; Bottino et al., 2014). Previous efforts have been focusing on overcoming rejection of recipients to the donor organs (Bottino et al., 2014). Porcine insulin differs from human insulin by one amino acid (alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) at the carboxy-terminal of the B chain (i.e. position B30) (Sonnenberg and Berger, 1983) (Supplementary Figure S1). This single amino acid difference can induce human antibodies to act against porcine insulin. As a result, the effectiveness is decreased when porcine insulin is used for the longterm treatment of diabetic patients (Clark et al., 1982). For the same reason, the transferred pig islets may not function well in human patients for a long period. To address this issue, here we attempt to generate genetically humanized pigs that produce human insulin rather than porcine insulin. We edited porcine INS (pINS) gene in fibroblasts by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or CRISPR/Cas9, combined with singlestranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) as homology donors. By using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, we successfully generated the genetically modified pigs exclusively expressing human insulin. Gene-editing animals have been generated by injecting the mRNA or proteins of custom endonuclease (such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALEN, and Cas9/gRNA) into one-cell stage embryos, which mostly resulted in mosaicism of the modification. In addition, the genotypes generated by embryo microinjection are variable and unpredictable (Crispo et al., 2015). One or two rounds of further breeding should be performed to obtain desired homozygotes with identical genotype and phenotype, which is particularly time and labor consuming for large animals with long gestation term and sex maturation age, such as pigs. To address this issue, our group has established an approach that employs gene-targeting somatic cells with SCNT, which could generate gene-editing animals with a single and identical mutation by one round of SCNT experiment. Recent reports have demonstrated that ssODNs, which are easily available, are more effective donors than traditional double-strand DNA homology for homology-directed repair (HDR), with the aid of custom endonucleases such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 (Bedell et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). In addition, when ssODNs are used as HDR donors, selection marker gene is not necessary, which enables to create seamless sitespecific mutations. The success of ssODN-mediated targeting strategy has been reported in cell lines or early stage embryos, but not yet in somatic cells, where homologous recombination with ssODNs is expected to be more difficult due to the limited proliferation competency. The length of ssODNs may affect the HDR efficiency in somatic cells. To optimize the length of ssODNs as donors, a HEK293 cell line with a fluorescence reporter was established, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was mutated by deleting T at 456 site (DEGFP), and thus a stop codon (TATA.TA-A) was created to prevent the EGFP expression. Seven ssODNs with different lengths were used as donors, combined with either TALENs or Cas9/gRNA, to repair DEGFP (Supplementary Figure S2A). Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the repairing efficiency (Supplementary Figures S2B and S3). We found that the repairing efficiency increased when the length of ssODNs ranged from (0 + 0) nt to (25 + 25) nt and remarkably decreased when the length of ssODNs reached (30 + 30) nt. However, the repairing efficiency increased again when the length of ssODNs increased from (30 + 30) nt (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S3). It had been reported that when short ssODNs of 15 2 25 nt were used as donors, an alternative genome repair mechanism, i.e. microhomology-mediated end 174 | Journal of Molecular Cell Biology (2016), 8(2), 174\u2013177 doi:10.1093/jmcb/mjw008"

The greatest obstacle is the primate immune/inflammatory response to the porcine (pig) islets, which may take the form of rapid early graft rejection (the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction) or T-cell-mediated rejection. These problems are being resolved by the genetic engineering of the source pigs combined with improved immunosuppressive therapy. The results of pig-to-diabetic nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation are steadily improving, with insulin independence being achieved for periods >1 year. An alternative approach is to isolate islets within a micro- or macroencapsulation device aimed at protecting them from the human recipient's immune response."

                            "The use of islets that originate from different species has been widely explored in order to circumvent the demand for human donors. Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (Tuch et al., 1996), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (Korsgren et al., 1991). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (Klymiuk et al., 2016). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (Yang et al., 2016). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (Korbutt et al., 1997) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (Cardona et al., 2006)(Hering et al., 2006) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment."

                            "Beginning in the 1990s, studies in diabetic animal models have demonstrated that porcine islet cell transplantation was sufficient to normalize blood glucose in the recipients, thus proving physiologic activity and metabolic regulation across the species barrier (Liu et al., 1991)(Tze et al., 1993). These findings raised hope for the implementation of xenogeneic cell replacement as potential therapy for a multitude of human diseases and disorders and inspired a number of research activities in the newly emerging field of xenogeneic cell therapy (London et al., 1995)(Kordower et al., 1995)(Isacson et al., 1995). In fact, translation into clinical trials was achieved for the application of porcine islets of Langerhans with (Vald\u00e9s\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005) and without Sertoli cells (Wang et al., 2011) to treat diabetic patients. Long-term follow-up studies documented decreased insulin requirements in a majority of patients (Vald\u00e9s\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2010) and the recent development of encapsulation strategies is supposed to overcome remaining immunological complications (Zhu et al., 2015)."

Rejection is one of the main constraints. This study presents the results of a clinical trial using a novel method for transplanting and immunoprotecting porcine islets in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA 4-year follow up of a clinical trial involving 12 patients, with no immunosuppressive drugs at any point. Eleven age matched untransplanted diabetics served as controls.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe have developed a procedure for protecting neonatal porcine islets by combining them with Sertoli cells and placing them in a novel subcutaneous autologous collagen-covered device.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the patients in the treatment group, no complications arose and no porcine endogenous retrovirus infection was detected. Half of the patients showed a significant reduction in insulin requirements compared with both their pre transplant levels and controls, and this reduction was maintained for up to 4 years. Two patients became insulin-independent for several months. Porcine insulin was detected in three patients' sera following glucose stimulation up to 4 years post transplant. Three years post transplant, one of four devices was removed from four patients, and the presence of insulin-positive cells in the transplant was demonstrated by immunohistology in all 4 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term cell survival with concurrent positive effects on metabolic control are possible by this technique."

After the transplantation, the patients were treated with a multiple drug immunosuppressive regimens. The first 14 patients were treated with cyclosporine (CsA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolon, and porcine C-peptide was not monitored, the following 2 patients were given cyklosporin and MMF only, while the next 6 patients were given a quadruple drug regimen consisting of OKT3, takrolimus, sirolimus and prednisolon. The blood glucose levels,exogenous insulin requirement,HbA1c, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and liver function were assessed before and after NPI transplantation. The serum porcine C peptide were monitored in last 8 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe first 14 patients required less insulin and the HbA1c dropped after the transplantation. In the 2 subsequent patients, the metabolic parameters remained unchanged and monitor of porcine C-peptide was negative. Insulin requirements were reduced in all 6 patients, and HbA1c was normalized 3 months after the transplantation. Significant levels of porcine C-peptide were detected in the patient serum. Two of the patients were given a second injection of NPIs, and one of them became insulin independent for 7 d. No serious adverse events were noted after the transplantation. There was no evidence of PERV transmission. Six out of the 22 patients were followed up for 4-6 years after the NPIs injection, immunosuppressive treatment was stopped 1 year after the transplantation. The patients started to take insulin at the time of follow up. Four patients restricted the intake of sugar, while the other 2 did not. One patient had ketoacidosis twice and slight diabetic retinopathy, and another patient had ketoacidosis induced by acute gastroenteritis. The remaining 4 patients did not have any complications. Assays for PERV were again negative.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nXenogenic islets can survive and function in the human body. No serious adverse events are noted."

Their high reproductive rates, amenability to genetic modification, and cost-effective maintenance further cement their position as the ideal xenotransplantation donor species. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nPigs are widely considered the most suitable animal candidates for xenotransplantation to humans, particularly for islet transplantation to treat diabetes <Paper corpusId=\"13397500\" paperTitle=\"(Zhu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This preference is based on several key advantages that make porcine models particularly promising for clinical applications.\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons for using porcine islets is their physiological and structural similarity to human islets <Paper corpusId=\"213778548\" paperTitle=\"(Chinnuswami et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Notably, porcine insulin differs from human insulin by only one amino acid, which explains why pig insulin has been successfully used to treat diabetic patients for decades before recombinant alternatives became available <Paper corpusId=\"270249498\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"213778548\" paperTitle=\"(Chinnuswami et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9034692\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This extensive history of safe and effective use of porcine insulin in humans provides strong evidence for the compatibility of pig islets with human physiology.\n\nPigs also offer practical advantages that make them ideal donors. They have high fecundity, allowing for rapid breeding and scaling of donor animals <Paper corpusId=\"273781593\" paperTitle=\"(Wong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, pigs can be efficiently genetically modified through well-established techniques, housed under pathogen-free conditions, and maintained in a cost-efficient manner <Paper corpusId=\"273781593\" paperTitle=\"(Wong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their organs are similar in size to humans, enabling the production of sufficient quantities of islets for effective transplantation <Paper corpusId=\"270249498\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent advances in genetic engineering have further enhanced the suitability of pigs for xenotransplantation. The ability to modify porcine donors to be more compatible with human recipients represents a significant advantage <Paper corpusId=\"24675095\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Specific genetic manipulations have proven useful in addressing hyperacute rejection and inflammatory reactions <Paper corpusId=\"24675095\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) pigs have shown decreased incidence of immune rejection and improved compatibility between donor and recipient <Paper corpusId=\"213778548\" paperTitle=\"(Chinnuswami et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe feasibility of using pig organs for xenotransplantation is further supported by successful preclinical studies. Multiple reports have demonstrated long-term survival of pig kidneys in non-human primates, with some grafts surviving well over six months <Paper corpusId=\"234365847\" paperTitle=\"(Pomposelli et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"19263737\" paperTitle=\"(Rivard et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73506387\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has achieved long-term reversal of diabetes in both diabetic rodents and non-human primate models <Paper corpusId=\"273781593\" paperTitle=\"(Wong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some studies have even reported the survival of adult porcine islets in rhesus monkeys for over 20 months <Paper corpusId=\"270249498\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these advantages, challenges remain. The recipient's immune response, incompatibility between certain biological systems, and the potential transfer of pathogenic organisms, including porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), present obstacles to clinical xenotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"252243986\" paperTitle=\"(Shahab et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, recent progress in PERV inactivation and the development of genetically modified pigs free of zoonotic microorganisms offer promising solutions to these concerns <Paper corpusId=\"252243986\" paperTitle=\"(Shahab et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "The success of porcine insulin and its role in the treatment of T1D has been well established since its discovery in the 1920s [11,12,25]. The structural and physiological similarities between human and pig organs, along with its unlimited supply, have made them an excellent translational research model [25]. Insulin extracted from pig islets has been used for the treatment of diabetes for decades [10, 11, 20, 33]. Because porcine islets produce insulin patterns similar to those found in humans, and because they are readily available [20], studies strongly suggest that islets obtained from pigs could be a promising substitute for human islets in the treatment of T1D. Recent studies on genetically engineered pigs suggest that these pigs are more suitable for xenotransplantation. For example, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) pigs, have decreased the incidence of immunerejection and improved compatibility between the donor and recipient [31][32][33][34][35](Bottino et al., 2007)."

                            "Dear Editor, Type1 diabetes (T1D) is a lifelong (chronic) disease and a majorhealth problem throughout the world. This disease can be treated by either insulin injection or islet transplantation. Islet transplantation is considered as a better treatment for T1D patients, because islets can produce and release insulin at the appropriate time, resulting in tight blood glucose control. However, islet transplantation is performed only for brittle T1D patients due to lack of sufficient donors: only 1 of 333 patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can obtain human islets (Frank et al., 2005). Porcine insulin has been applied to treat T1D. Recently, pig islets have also proved to be an attractive alternative resource for solving the donor shortage issue for islet transplantation. Many preclinical trials of porcine islet transplantation have been performed and have already achieved long-term survival of porcine islets in primate recipients (Cardona et al., 2006; Bottino et al., 2014). Previous efforts have been focusing on overcoming rejection of recipients to the donor organs (Bottino et al., 2014). Porcine insulin differs from human insulin by one amino acid (alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) at the carboxy-terminal of the B chain (i.e. position B30) (Sonnenberg and Berger, 1983) (Supplementary Figure S1). This single amino acid difference can induce human antibodies to act against porcine insulin. As a result, the effectiveness is decreased when porcine insulin is used for the longterm treatment of diabetic patients (Clark et al., 1982). For the same reason, the transferred pig islets may not function well in human patients for a long period. To address this issue, here we attempt to generate genetically humanized pigs that produce human insulin rather than porcine insulin. We edited porcine INS (pINS) gene in fibroblasts by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or CRISPR/Cas9, combined with singlestranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) as homology donors. By using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology, we successfully generated the genetically modified pigs exclusively expressing human insulin. Gene-editing animals have been generated by injecting the mRNA or proteins of custom endonuclease (such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALEN, and Cas9/gRNA) into one-cell stage embryos, which mostly resulted in mosaicism of the modification. In addition, the genotypes generated by embryo microinjection are variable and unpredictable (Crispo et al., 2015). One or two rounds of further breeding should be performed to obtain desired homozygotes with identical genotype and phenotype, which is particularly time and labor consuming for large animals with long gestation term and sex maturation age, such as pigs. To address this issue, our group has established an approach that employs gene-targeting somatic cells with SCNT, which could generate gene-editing animals with a single and identical mutation by one round of SCNT experiment. Recent reports have demonstrated that ssODNs, which are easily available, are more effective donors than traditional double-strand DNA homology for homology-directed repair (HDR), with the aid of custom endonucleases such as zinc-finger nuclease, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 (Bedell et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). In addition, when ssODNs are used as HDR donors, selection marker gene is not necessary, which enables to create seamless sitespecific mutations. The success of ssODN-mediated targeting strategy has been reported in cell lines or early stage embryos, but not yet in somatic cells, where homologous recombination with ssODNs is expected to be more difficult due to the limited proliferation competency. The length of ssODNs may affect the HDR efficiency in somatic cells. To optimize the length of ssODNs as donors, a HEK293 cell line with a fluorescence reporter was established, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was mutated by deleting T at 456 site (DEGFP), and thus a stop codon (TATA.TA-A) was created to prevent the EGFP expression. Seven ssODNs with different lengths were used as donors, combined with either TALENs or Cas9/gRNA, to repair DEGFP (Supplementary Figure S2A). Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the repairing efficiency (Supplementary Figures S2B and S3). We found that the repairing efficiency increased when the length of ssODNs ranged from (0 + 0) nt to (25 + 25) nt and remarkably decreased when the length of ssODNs reached (30 + 30) nt. However, the repairing efficiency increased again when the length of ssODNs increased from (30 + 30) nt (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S3). It had been reported that when short ssODNs of 15 2 25 nt were used as donors, an alternative genome repair mechanism, i.e. microhomology-mediated end 174 | Journal of Molecular Cell Biology (2016), 8(2), 174\u2013177 doi:10.1093/jmcb/mjw008"

                            "The use of islets that originate from different species has been widely explored in order to circumvent the demand for human donors. Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (Tuch et al., 1996), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (Korsgren et al., 1991). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (Klymiuk et al., 2016). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (Yang et al., 2016). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (Korbutt et al., 1997) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (Cardona et al., 2006)(Hering et al., 2006) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment."

                            "We have previously reported that co\u2010transplantation of the kidney with vascularized donor thymus from \u03b1\u20101,3\u2010galactosyltransferase gene knockout pigs with an anti\u2010CD154 with rituximab\u2010based regimen led to improved xenograft survival in baboons with donor\u2010specific unresponsiveness. However, nephrotic syndrome emerged as a complication in which the glomeruli showed mild mesangial expansion with similarities to minimal change disease (MCD) in humans. Since MCD is associated with CD80 expression in glomeruli and elevated urinary excretion, we evaluated a potential role for CD80 in xenograft nephropathy. Study 1 confirmed high urinary CD80 excretion in nephrotic animals with renal xenografts showing CD80 expression in glomeruli. In Study 2, baboons receiving xenografts received CTLA4\u2010Ig once a week from the second postoperative week or no CTLA4\u2010Ig. The non\u2010CTLA4\u2010Ig group developed severe proteinuria with modest mesangial expansion with high urinary excretion of CD80 and documented CD80 expression in glomerular podocytes. All of the recipients in non\u2010CTLA4\u2010Ig groups had to be euthanized before POD 60. In contrast, CTLA4\u2010Ig group showed a marked reduction in proteinuria and survived significantly longer, up to 193 days. These results demonstrate that anti\u2010CD80 targeted therapy represents a promising strategy for reduction of proteinuria following renal xeno\u2010transplantation with improved survival."

                            "The shortage of available organs remains the greatest barrier to expanding access to transplant. Despite advances in genetic editing and immunosuppression, survival in experimental models of kidney xenotransplant has generally been limited to <100 days. We found that pretransplant selection of recipients with low titers of anti\u2010pig antibodies significantly improved survival in a pig\u2010to\u2013rhesus macaque kidney transplant model (6 days vs median survival time 235 days). Immunosuppression included transient pan\u2013T cell depletion and an anti\u2010CD154\u2013based maintenance regimen. Selective depletion of CD4+ T cells but not CD8+ T cells resulted in long\u2010term survival (median survival time >400 days vs 6 days). These studies suggested that CD4+ T cells may have a more prominent role in xenograft rejection compared with CD8+ T cells. Although animals that received selective depletion of CD8+ T cells showed signs of early cellular rejection (marked CD4+ infiltrates), animals receiving selective CD4+ depletion exhibited normal biopsy results until late, when signs of chronic antibody rejection were present. In vitro study results suggested that rhesus CD4+ T cells required the presence of SLA class II to mount an effective proliferative response. The combination of low pretransplant anti\u2010pig antibody and CD4 depletion resulted in consistent, long\u2010term xenograft survival."

Pigs that have been genetically modified to PERV have the potential to offer safe and effective organ and tissue supplies for xenotransplantation in the future",
                            "Still, significant challenges to clinical human islet xenotransplantation are present, and future efforts should be directed toward developing an ideal genetically engineered swine islet donor source and establishing long-term viable islets with clinically meaningful immunosuppression. Researchers have proven that by successfully bypassing all the hurdles faced in xenotransplantation, in addition to being an effective means of obtaining normal blood glucose levels and reducing several illnesses associated with diabetes, it might embark a novel way for new therapeutic options for type 1 diabetic patients."

Along with successful porcine islet isolation, the need for a site that can provide optimal revascularisation leading to adequate blood glucose control is essential for long-term success (Hawthorne et al., 2011). We have previously shown that fetal pig pancreatic fragments (FPPFs) transplanted under the kidney capsule where these kidneys were subsequently transplanted can effectively cure both renal failure and diabetes in a single transplant (Hawthorne et al., 2011). Xenotransplantation of a composite kidney/FPPF graft would have the significant advantages of only requiring a single transplant and giving time for the FPPFs to mature prior to transplantation (Hawthorne et al., 2011)."

The pig may potentially be an unlimited source of organs for patients with diabetes, although the appropriate age for islet isolation is not known. As juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, we analyzed the distribution of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development to propose an appropriate age cut-off for islet isolation from the juvenile porcine pancreas [43]. We found that the isolation of porcine pancreatic islets approximately 35 d after birth may offer benefits with regard to their xenotransplantation potential. Further research into the optimal timeline for islet isolation is being conducted in DPF pigs generated at our research center."

This modification has markedly decreased immune rejection incidents and improved compatibility between donors and recipients <Paper corpusId=\"213778548\" paperTitle=\"(Chinnuswami et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"49671931\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. The elimination of Gal, recognized as the most relevant xenoantigen, represented a major milestone in xenotransplantation advancement, with GTKO pigs now considered the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation <Paper corpusId=\"49671931\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFurther genetic modifications have built upon this foundation, particularly through the expression of human complement-regulatory proteins in porcine tissues. Transgenic pigs expressing human CD46 have demonstrated enhanced islet survival when transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, with some achieving normoglycemia for over 12 months <Paper corpusId=\"25192957\" paperTitle=\"(Dufrane et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12226191\" paperTitle=\"(Windt et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, the islet group in Pittsburgh achieved long-term islet graft function (up to 1 year) in diabetic non-human primates using porcine islets genetically modified to express human CD46 <Paper corpusId=\"49671931\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nImportantly, combining multiple genetic modifications has proven more effective than single modifications. Islets from pigs with both GTKO and expression of human complement regulators (GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 or GalTKO.hCD39.hCD46) have demonstrated reduced islet loss and attenuated instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) <Paper corpusId=\"268184373\" paperTitle=\"(Eisenson et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. A landmark study showed that neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC) from GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 pigs could cure diabetes long-term in immunosuppressed baboons, with maximum graft survival exceeding 22 months <Paper corpusId=\"249811427\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother innovative approach involves cell-specific genetic modifications. Researchers have developed transgenic pigs with \u03b2-cell-specific expression of LEA29Y, an immunomodulatory protein.

                            "Xenotransplantation can be the answer to this limited donor availability and, among possible candidate tissues for xenotransplantation, porcine islets are the closest to a future clinical application. Xenotransplantation, with pigs as donors, offers the possibility of using healthy, living, and genetically modified islets from pathogen-free animals available in unlimited number of islets. Several studies in the pig-to-nonhuman primate model demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical islet xenotransplantation and have provided insights into the critical events and possible mechanisms of immune recognition and rejection of xenogeneic islet grafts. Particularly promising results in the achievement of prolonged insulin independence were obtained with newly developed, genetically modified pigs islets able to produce immunoregulatory products, using different implantation sites, and new immunotherapeutic strategies."

                            "The success of porcine insulin and its role in the treatment of T1D has been well established since its discovery in the 1920s [11,12,25]. The structural and physiological similarities between human and pig organs, along with its unlimited supply, have made them an excellent translational research model [25]. Insulin extracted from pig islets has been used for the treatment of diabetes for decades [10, 11, 20, 33]. Because porcine islets produce insulin patterns similar to those found in humans, and because they are readily available [20], studies strongly suggest that islets obtained from pigs could be a promising substitute for human islets in the treatment of T1D. Recent studies on genetically engineered pigs suggest that these pigs are more suitable for xenotransplantation. For example, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) pigs, have decreased the incidence of immunerejection and improved compatibility between the donor and recipient [31][32][33][34][35](Bottino et al., 2007)."

                            "Further on the frontiers of medicine are alternative methods to produce islets without relying on human organ donors, including techniques for the xenotransplantation of porcine islets. Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (London et al., 1995). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (Hering et al., 2006)(Cardona et al., 2006). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (Phelps et al., 2003). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46)."

We investigated whether the transgenic expression of a human complement\u2010regulatory protein (hCD46) on porcine islets would improve the outcome of islet xenotransplantation in streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys. Immunosuppression consisted of thymoglobulin, anti\u2010CD154 mAb for costimulation blockade, and mycophenolate mofetil. Following the transplantation of islets from wild\u2010type pigs (n = 2) or from 1,3\u2010galactosyltransferase gene\u2010knockout pigs (n = 2), islets survived for a maximum of only 46 days, as evidenced by return to hyperglycemia and the need for exogenous insulin therapy. The transplantation of islets from hCD46 pigs resulted in graft survival and insulin\u2010independent normoglycemia in four of five monkeys for the 3 months follow\u2010up of the experiment. One normalized recipient, selected at random, was followed for >12 months. Inhibition of complement activation by the expression of hCD46 on the pig islets did not substantially reduce the initial loss of islet mass, rather was effective in limiting antibody\u2010mediated rejection. This resulted in a reduced need for immunosuppression to preserve a sufficient islet mass to maintain normoglycemia long\u2010term."

The first clinical trial was performed using fetal pigs and demonstrated the porcine pancreatic tissue could survive in human body with immunosuppressive strategies. To scale up the islet production, Canadian group established a method for islet isolation from neonatal pigs. Their method has been used for clinical islet xenotransplantation in New Zealand, Russian, Mexico, Argentina, and China. Recently Korean group published a clinical protocol for islet xenotransplantation using adult pigs. For the next generation of islet xenotransplantation, gene-modified pigs were created. Especially \"superislets\" created by Belgian group demonstrated promising preclinical outcomes."

Porcine organs are viewed as the perfect candidate for a source of xenografts. However, the recipient's immunity, incompatibility of biologic systems, and transfer of new pathogenic organisms are all obstacles to clinical xenotransplantation, in addition to the risk of zoonosis and xenoantigens",
                            "The ideal porcine candidate for xenotransplantation is a pig devoid of any zoonotic micro-organisms and PERV-C. PERV-inactivation has proved to be beneficial for successful xenotransplantation. Pigs that have been genetically modified to PERV have the potential to offer safe and effective organ and tissue supplies for xenotransplantation in the future",

The greatest obstacle is the primate immune/inflammatory response to the porcine (pig) islets, which may take the form of rapid early graft rejection (the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction) or T-cell-mediated rejection. These problems are being resolved by the genetic engineering of the source pigs combined with improved immunosuppressive therapy. The results of pig-to-diabetic nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation are steadily improving, with insulin independence being achieved for periods >1 year.

In islet xenotransplantation, islet encapsulation and gene editing technologies are currently used to alleviate rejection (Dufrane et al., 2013)."

Their BetaO2 device consists of islet compartments and a replenishable oxygen reservoir: a method which allowed better oxygenation and function of the islets, without immunological communication or pathogen transfer between the recipient and the donor graft.

                            "Developing a device that protects xenogeneic islets to allow treatment and potentially cure of diabetes in large mammals has been a major challenge in the past decade. Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy."

While these early trials established feasibility, they did not show significant improvement in patients <Paper corpusId=\"49671931\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSince these initial studies, clinical islet xenotransplantation has expanded globally. Canadian researchers developed methods for isolating islets from neonatal pigs that have been implemented in clinical trials across multiple countries including New Zealand, Russia, Mexico, Argentina, and China <Paper corpusId=\"277939601\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumoto et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. More recently, Korean researchers have published clinical protocols for islet xenotransplantation using adult pigs <Paper corpusId=\"277939601\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumoto et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA significant breakthrough came in 2016 when Matsumoto and colleagues conducted a clinical trial using microencapsulated pig islets in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressive therapy. The results were remarkable, with recipients experiencing long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness <Paper corpusId=\"250455529\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, other clinical trials using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets reported that xenografts were maintained for more than two years with a significant reduction in hypoglycemic episodes <Paper corpusId=\"252764239\" paperTitle=\"(Deng et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSafety concerns, particularly regarding porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), have been closely monitored in clinical trials. Encouragingly, long-term follow-up of human recipients of pig islets has found no evidence of PERV transmission, supporting the safety profile of this approach <Paper corpusId=\"250455529\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these advances, clinical results of islet xenotransplantation have been mixed <Paper corpusId=\"268184373\" paperTitle=\"(Eisenson et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The most promising outcomes have involved genetically modified source pigs, particularly those with carbohydrate antigen gene knockouts combined with complement regulatory transgenes. Islets from GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 and GalTKO.hCD39.hCD46 source pigs have demonstrated reduced islet loss and attenuated instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) in clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"268184373\" paperTitle=\"(Eisenson et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLooking ahead, several approaches are advancing the field toward broader clinical implementation. Encapsulation technologies that allow for durable glucose control without immunosuppression remain a particularly valuable application for porcine islet xenotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"268184373\" paperTitle=\"(Eisenson et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Free (nonencapsulated) pig islets, either wild-type or genetically engineered, have maintained normoglycemia in immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for over one year, while immunoisolated (encapsulated) pig islets have maintained normoglycemia in non-immunosuppressed diabetic nonhuman primates for up to six months <Paper corpusId=\"5333458\" paperTitle=\"(Ekser et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDevelopment of appropriate animal models for evaluating xenotransplantation therapies is also progressing. Immune-compromised mini-pigs created through combined thymectomy, splenectomy, and immunosuppression have shown long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts, potentially providing a promising platform for evaluating cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets <Paper corpusId=\"273348080\" paperTitle=\"(Yamasaki et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"160010000\" paperTitle=\"(Itoh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe next generation of islet xenotransplantation is focusing on gene-modified pigs, with particularly promising preclinical outcomes demonstrated by \"superislets\" created by Belgian researchers <Paper corpusId=\"277939601\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumoto et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Further on the frontiers of medicine are alternative methods to produce islets without relying on human organ donors, including techniques for the xenotransplantation of porcine islets. Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (London et al., 1995). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (Hering et al., 2006)(Cardona et al., 2006). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (Phelps et al., 2003). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46)."

                            "Xenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted (Vald\u00e9s\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2010)",
                            "In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24."

(London et al., 1995)(London et al., 1995) performed the first clinical islet xenotransplantation using foetal porcine islet cell-like clusters (ICCs), providing preliminary data for subsequent clinical islet xenotransplantation. There has also been some work in islet xenotransplantation from pigs to NHPs and successful reversal of recipient diabetes and achievement of long-term normoglycemia (Dufrane et al., 2006)(Hering et al., 2006)Cardona et al., 2007). Moreover, in some clinical trials (Yang et al., 2015), xenografts were performed using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets, and the grafts were maintained for more than 2 years with a significant reduction in the number of hypoglycemic episodes. In islet xenotransplantation, islet encapsulation and gene editing technologies are currently used to alleviate rejection (Dufrane et al., 2013)."

                            "Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models (Itoh et al., 2019) . Itoh et al. (Itoh et al., 2019) recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue."

                            "Before they are used in the clinical setting, the effectiveness of artificially produced human-derived tissue-engineered medical products should be verified in an immunodeficient animal model, such as severe combined immunodeficient mice. However, small animal models are not sufficient to evaluate large-sized products for human use. Thus, an immunodeficient large animal model is necessary in order to properly evaluate the clinical efficacy of human-derived tissue-engineered products, such as artificial grafts. Here we report the development of an immunodeficient pig model, the operational immunodeficient pig (OIDP), by surgically removing the thymus and spleen, and creating a controlled immunosuppressive protocol using a combination of drugs commonly used in the clinical setting. We find that this model allows the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts. The development of the OIDP is an essential step towards a comprehensive and clinically relevant evaluation of human cell regeneration strategies at the preclinical stage. The development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts heavily relies on the availability of large animal models that allow long-term assessment of graft patency. Here Itoh et al. propose a novel model of immunodeficient pigs that allows long-term accommodation of human cell-derived three-dimensional bioprinted vascular tubes."
