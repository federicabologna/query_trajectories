                    "text": "The typical structure of LNPs comprises four essential components: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids. [9,64] These components confer distinct advantages to LNPs in delivering nucleic acid drugs. The nucleic acid component of these drugs is negatively charged, while the ionizable cationic lipids, a critical component of LNPs, feature a positively charged hydrophilic amino head in acidic environments. This allows for the encapsulation of nucleic acids within the lipid nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. In a neutral plasma environment, these lipids are uncharged, thus avoiding uptake by monocyte macrophages, reducing toxicity, and finally becoming endosomes for release into the cytoplasm through megacellular drinking. [65] Among them, the key to improve the delivery efficiency is the release of LNPs from endosomes, i.e., the efficiency of endosome escape. The mechanism of endosomal escape is closely related to ionizable cationic lipids. One theory hypothesizes that cationic lipids interact with anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane to form a non-bilayer structure and disrupt the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing nucleic acids. [66] In contrast, another hypothesis suggests that the delivery efficiency of cationic lipids can be attributed to the pro-ton sponge phenomenon, in which buffering cationic polymers bind protons in the endosomes and activate the endosomal proton pump, allowing chloride ions to enter the endosomes along with the protons, elevating the osmotic pressure and causing the endosomes to swell and rupture. [67] However, the inefficiency of endosomal escape and the unidentified mechanism still make it a rate-limiting step in the delivery of LNPs. [68] PEGylated lipids prevent the aggregation of LNPs, while phospholipids contribute to nanoparticle formation. Cholesterol enhances the stability of nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles and promotes their fusion with cellular membranes. [9,69,70]",

[66] In contrast, another hypothesis suggests that the delivery efficiency of cationic lipids can be attributed to the pro-ton sponge phenomenon, in which buffering cationic polymers bind protons in the endosomes and activate the endosomal proton pump, allowing chloride ions to enter the endosomes along with the protons, elevating the osmotic pressure and causing the endosomes to swell and rupture. [67] However, the inefficiency of endosomal escape and the unidentified mechanism still make it a rate-limiting step in the delivery of LNPs. [68] PEGylated lipids prevent the aggregation of LNPs, while phospholipids contribute to nanoparticle formation. Cholesterol enhances the stability of nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles and promotes their fusion with cellular membranes. [9,69,70]",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies.

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

                    "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.\n\n## Chemical structures of key lipids\nBy simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.\n\n## DELIVERY MECHANISMS OF ORGAN-SELECTIVE LNPs IN VIVO\nChanges in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25 It has been demonstrated that by designing novel ionizable lipids (ILs) and optimizing LNPs formulations, the type of proteins adsorbed onto the LNPs surface can be influenced, thereby achieving organ-specific delivery. 137 However, although targeting strategies designed via formulation optimization often result in preferential uptake by certain organs, achieving a high level of target cell specificity is rarely realized. Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140\n...\nRecent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140 Understanding the components of LNPs and the nature of the protein coronas will be more useful in understanding the subsequent fate of LNPs in vivo and in designing organ-targeted LNPs for treating specific diseases. 122 ince apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in endogenous cholesterol transport, it binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) overexpressed in hepatocytes and enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.",

                    "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

Catenacci, Rachele Rossi, Francesca Sechi, Daniela Buonocore, Milena Sorrenti, S. Perteghella, Marco Peviani, M. Bonferoni\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.\n## PEG-Lipids\nThe illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it. Furthermore, Figure 6. The illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38].\n\n## Protein Corona\nWhen NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

However, effective gene delivery remains a formidable challenge to overcome. The presence of degrading enzymes, acidic pH conditions, and the gastrointestinal mucus layer pose significant barriers for genetic therapy, necessitating exploration of alternative therapeutic options. In recent years, transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery modalities offer promising avenues with multiple advantages, such as non-invasion, avoided liver first-pass effect and improved patient compliance. Considering the rapid development of gene therapeutics via transdermal and transpulmonary administration, here we aim to summarize the nearest advances in transdermal and transpulmonary gene drug delivery. In this review, we firstly elaborate on current delivery carrier in gene therapy. We, further, describe approaches and applications for enhancing transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery encompassing microneedles, chemical enhancers, physical methods for transdermal administration as well as nebulized formulations, dry powder formulations, and pressurized metered dose formulations for efficient transpulmonary delivery. Last but not least, the opportunities and outlooks of gene therapy through both administrated routes are highlighted.",

                    "text": "In vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

However, effective gene delivery remains a formidable challenge to overcome. The presence of degrading enzymes, acidic pH conditions, and the gastrointestinal mucus layer pose significant barriers for genetic therapy, necessitating exploration of alternative therapeutic options. In recent years, transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery modalities offer promising avenues with multiple advantages, such as non-invasion, avoided liver first-pass effect and improved patient compliance. Considering the rapid development of gene therapeutics via transdermal and transpulmonary administration, here we aim to summarize the nearest advances in transdermal and transpulmonary gene drug delivery. In this review, we firstly elaborate on current delivery carrier in gene therapy. We, further, describe approaches and applications for enhancing transdermal and transpulmonary gene delivery encompassing microneedles, chemical enhancers, physical methods for transdermal administration as well as nebulized formulations, dry powder formulations, and pressurized metered dose formulations for efficient transpulmonary delivery. Last but not least, the opportunities and outlooks of gene therapy through both administrated routes are highlighted.\n## Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)\nIn vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

            "abstract": "Significance Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology is increasingly enabling many gene therapies. Once LNPs are administered in vivo, preferential LNP targeting to desired cells can be attributed to the formation of a biomolecular corona (BMC), however, characterization of the corona is challenging. This is due to poor separation efficiency of LNP\u2013corona complexes from unbound proteins. Herein, we developed magnetic iron-oxide-loaded LNPs (IOLNP) that allow separation of LNP\u2013corona complexes from biological media through magnetic separation. This technology enables a rapid and selective method to separate LNP\u2013corona complexes and enables in-depth characterization of the BMC while maintaining the particle integrity.",

However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

Schiffelers, Dominik Witzigmann, P. Cullis\n## Abstract\nSignificance Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology is increasingly enabling many gene therapies. Once LNPs are administered in vivo, preferential LNP targeting to desired cells can be attributed to the formation of a biomolecular corona (BMC), however, characterization of the corona is challenging. This is due to poor separation efficiency of LNP\u2013corona complexes from unbound proteins. Herein, we developed magnetic iron-oxide-loaded LNPs (IOLNP) that allow separation of LNP\u2013corona complexes from biological media through magnetic separation. This technology enables a rapid and selective method to separate LNP\u2013corona complexes and enables in-depth characterization of the BMC while maintaining the particle integrity.\n## body\nLipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.\n\n## lipid nanoparticles | iron oxide nanoparticles | biomolecular corona | magnetic separation\nLipid nanoparticles (LNP) have emerged as an effective nonviral delivery system for nucleic acid payloads due to their high encapsulation efficiency, low toxicity, ability to facilitate intracellular delivery, and the possibility to modulate their size and surface properties (1)(2)(3). The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.",

                    "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.\n## Protein corona\nThe formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.",

The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.\n## PEG Shedding\nThe PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration.

The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially.

In this study, a family of LNPs is developed with robust high efficiency in addressing the multiple barriers in cytosolic protein delivery by incorporating clinically approved ionizable lipids into traditional cationic LNPs. The combination of cationic and ionizable lipids enables efficient protein binding and endosomal escape. Optimized LNPs efficiently deliver various proteins, including antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and Cas9 into living cells with reserved functions. Moreover, the designed LNPs show high serum stability during protein delivery, and the serum albumin adsorbed on LNPs facilitates protein delivery via albumin receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, enabling highly efficient protein delivery in vivo. The optimized LNPs successfully deliver therapeutic proteins such as saporin and interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010) to inhibit tumor growth in several animal models. The IL\u201010 loaded LNPs enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and improved the antitumor effect of adoptive transferred OT\u20101 CD8+ T cells to melanoma. This study expands the applications of LNPs for the delivery of biomacromolecules, and the developed LNP formulations have enormous potential for the delivery of protein therapeutics to treat various diseases.\n",

Among them, ionizable lipids are the key components that determine the titer, mRNA delivery efficiency, degradability, and reactivity (Drescher and van Hoogevest, 2020). At low pH, ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic buffers, producing a positive charge and binding to negatively charged mRNA, whereas they remain neutral at physiological pH (Chan et al., 2021;Scalzo et al., 2022). The delivery mechanism of LNPs is shown in Figure 4. Ionizable lipids are less cytotoxic than cationic lipids. This is because the positive charge of cationic lipids typically interacts with negatively charged molecules on the cell surface, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. In contrast, ionizable lipids can dynamically regulate their charge state in the cellular environment, avoiding the continuous release of positive charges to the cell surface and reducing cytotoxicity (Sharma et al., 2014). In general, PEGbound lipids in LNPs occupy the smallest molar percentage, which can enhance particle stability by affecting charge distribution, size, and dispersion, and hinder LNPs from aggregating, playing a crucial role in blood circulation and biological distribution (Albertsen and Camilla et al., 2022;Kon et al., 2022;Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2023). Structural lipids are chiefly used to support the structure of particles and enhance stability during storage and circulation (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Witzigmann et al., 2020). According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023).",

Previously, a method of soft corona fixation using click chemistry was proposed [10], which requires separate modification of hard corona and serum proteins. Our approach involves PACL modification of only serum proteins, which are then sorbed onto the surface of MLNCs, form hard and soft coronas, and are fixed to the surface under UV irradiation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the serum components carried one or two modifications. After incubation of MLNCs in modified serum and UV irradiation under chosen conditions, particles bearing a full corona were isolated. MLNCs were visualized using TEM at each stage of this study. The formation of a HC did not change the structure of MLNC/HCs compared to MLNCs, while the full corona was clearly visualized. A full corona under the selected conditions and with a photomodifier does not completely cover the surface of the particles but forms aggregates with linear dimensions comparable to the particle sizes. Apparently, such sorption of corona proteins is due to the heterogeneity of the lipid-peptide membrane, which may be caused by clustering of its components.",

Epanchintseva, Julia E. Poletaeva, Irina A Bakhno, Vladimir V. Belov, A. Grigor\u2019eva, S. V. Baranova, E. Ryabchikova, Ilya S. Dovydenko\n## Abstract\nSpontaneous sorption of proteins on the nanoparticles\u2019 surface leads to the fact that nanoparticles in biological media are always enveloped by a layer of proteins\u2014the protein corona. Corona proteins affect the properties of nanoparticles and their behavior in a biological environment. In this regard, knowledge about the composition of the corona is a necessary element for the development of nanomedicine. Because proteins have different sorption efficacy, isolating particles with a full corona and characterizing the full corona is challenging. In this study, we propose a photo-activated cross-linker for full protein corona fixation. We believe that the application of our proposed approach will make it possible to capture and visualize the full corona on nanoparticles coated with a lipid shell.\n## Discussion\nWe are the first to demonstrate the feasibility of fixing a full-protein corona on the lipid surface of composite nanoparticles (MLNCs) using PACL. Previously, a method of soft corona fixation using click chemistry was proposed [10], which requires separate modification of hard corona and serum proteins. Our approach involves PACL modification of only serum proteins, which are then sorbed onto the surface of MLNCs, form hard and soft coronas, and are fixed to the surface under UV irradiation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the serum components carried one or two modifications. After incubation of MLNCs in modified serum and UV irradiation under chosen conditions, particles bearing a full corona were isolated. MLNCs were visualized using TEM at each stage of this study. The formation of a HC did not change the structure of MLNC/HCs compared to MLNCs, while the full corona was clearly visualized. A full corona under the selected conditions and with a photomodifier does not completely cover the surface of the particles but forms aggregates with linear dimensions comparable to the particle sizes. Apparently, such sorption of corona proteins is due to the heterogeneity of the lipid-peptide membrane, which may be caused by clustering of its components.",

This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs.

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021).

Ivanov, V. Reshetnikov\n## Abstract\nToday, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are some of the main delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics. The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.\n## Typical biodistribution of LNPs\nThe lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),\n\n## Helper lipids\nFor classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used. The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Today, researchers have found conditions to overcome the two main drug delivery dilemmas. On the one side, the versatility of the vehicle to efficiently load, protect and transport the drug and then release it at the target place. On the other hand, the questions related to the degree of PEGylation which are needed to avoid nanoparticle (NP) aggregation and opsonization while preventing cellular uptake. The development of different kinds of lipidic drug delivery vehicles and particles has resulted in the development of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs), which can overcome most of the typical drug delivery problems. Proof of their success is the late approval and massive administration as the prophylactic vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. These ILNPs are built by electrostatic aggregation of surfactants, the therapeutic agent, and lipids that self-segregate from an aqueous solution, forming nanoparticles stabilized with lipid polymers, such as PEG. These vehicles overcome previous limitations such as low loading and high toxicity, likely thanks to low charge at the working pH and reduced size, and their entry into the cells via endocytosis rather than membrane perforation or fusion, always associated with higher toxicity. We herein revise their primary features, synthetic methods to prepare and characterize them, pharmacokinetic (administration, distribution, metabolization and excretion) aspects, and biodistribution and fate. Owing to their advantages, iLNPs are potential drug delivery systems to improve the management of various diseases and widely available for clinical use.",

Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

Bastus, V. Puntes\n## Abstract\nThe long quest for efficient drug administration has been looking for a universal carrier that can precisely transport traditional drugs, new genomic and proteic therapeutic agents. Today, researchers have found conditions to overcome the two main drug delivery dilemmas. On the one side, the versatility of the vehicle to efficiently load, protect and transport the drug and then release it at the target place. On the other hand, the questions related to the degree of PEGylation which are needed to avoid nanoparticle (NP) aggregation and opsonization while preventing cellular uptake. The development of different kinds of lipidic drug delivery vehicles and particles has resulted in the development of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs), which can overcome most of the typical drug delivery problems. Proof of their success is the late approval and massive administration as the prophylactic vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. These ILNPs are built by electrostatic aggregation of surfactants, the therapeutic agent, and lipids that self-segregate from an aqueous solution, forming nanoparticles stabilized with lipid polymers, such as PEG. These vehicles overcome previous limitations such as low loading and high toxicity, likely thanks to low charge at the working pH and reduced size, and their entry into the cells via endocytosis rather than membrane perforation or fusion, always associated with higher toxicity. We herein revise their primary features, synthetic methods to prepare and characterize them, pharmacokinetic (administration, distribution, metabolization and excretion) aspects, and biodistribution and fate. Owing to their advantages, iLNPs are potential drug delivery systems to improve the management of various diseases and widely available for clinical use.\n## Transformations and metabolization\nDepending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73). Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76].

Witzigmann, J. Kulkarni, Jerry Leung, Sam Chen, P. Cullis, R. van der Meel\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Optimizing LNP characteristics\nin the MPS, most likely due to scavenger receptor recognition [159].\n\nThe lipid sensitivity to phospholipase is another important factor modulating intrahepatic LNP distribution and activity. Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165]. How the biomolecular corona can be leveraged to optimize targeting of different cell types within",

This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.",

Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

Pandey, H. Uluda\u01e7\n## Abstract\nRNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.\n## Liver Accumulation\nOne major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.\n## Introduction\nPharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3].

Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems.

Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

Aim: This review aims to explore advanced drug delivery systems developed to enhance the efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics, focusing on both viral and non-viral methods, and to evaluate the progress and limitations of these systems in clinical applications. Methods: The review synthesizes recent advancements in RNA delivery technologies, including viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer-based nanoparticles, and hybrid systems. It also examines various targeting strategies such as passive and active targeting to improve the specificity and efficiency of RNA delivery. Results: Significant progress has been made with both viral and non-viral delivery systems. Viral vectors, though effective, face challenges related to immunogenicity and production costs. Non-viral systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based carriers, have shown promising results, with several FDA-approved products demonstrating clinical efficacy. Advances in targeting strategies, including ligand-based and antibody-based methods, have improved the precision of RNA delivery.",

Lagan\u00e0\n## Abstract\nIn physiological environments (e.g. the blood), nanoparticles (NPs) are surrounded by a layer of biomolecules referred to as a \u2018protein corona\u2019 (PC). The most tightly NP-bound proteins form the so-called hard corona (HC), the key bio-entity that determines the NP's biological identity and physiological response. To date, NP-HC has been almost exclusively characterized in vitro, while NP\u2013protein interactions under realistic in vivo conditions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we thoroughly characterized the in vivo HC of a NP formulation that forms around lipid nanoparticles with a lipid composition equal to that of clinically used liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\u00ae) after the recovery of the NPs from the blood circulation of FVB/N mice 10 minutes post intravenous administration. In vitro HC formed by 10 minutes incubation of NPs in FVB/N mouse plasma was used for comparison. Here we show that the biological identity (i.e. size, zeta-potential and aggregation state) of NPs in vivo is significantly different from that acquired in vitro. Furthermore, the variety of protein species in the in vivo HC was considerably larger. The present work has demonstrated that characterization of the in vivo HC is essential to provide an accurate molecular description of the biological identity of NPs in physiological environments.\n",

The protein corona plays a critical role in the recognition and clearance of the particles by the immune system. When particles are inhaled, components of the lung surfactant also form a corona, though the composition differs from that formed by plasma. (Rampado et al., 2020;Kapralov et al., 2012). \n\nProteomic analysis of LS coronas bound to nanoparticles (separated Comparing protein coronas formed by LS and crude plasma, only 4 of the top 20 abundant proteins are shared. LS corona also contains a major lipid component, the most abundant of which are phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. The protein:lipid ratio of the LS corona is estimated to be 1:10. From a molecular function standpoint, LS corona has enhanced catalytic and structural activity, plasma corona has enhanced antioxidant and enzyme regulation activity, and both have a strong emphasis on binding. (Raesch et al., 2015). \n\nCoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations found that the structure of LS corona varied with particle surface chemistry. Lipids arranged in a monolayer conformation on hydrophobic polystyrene nanoparticles but arranged in a bilayer on hydrophilic silver nanoparticles. Surfactant proteins B and C are found to interact with the corona lipid layers in parallel and transmembrane orientations respectively, in agreement with their behavior in bulk LS. SP-A is found to bind to nanoparticle surfaces via the carbohydrate recognition domain exclusively. Once the corona is formed, the subsequent pharmacokinetics of inhaled nanoparticles are altered. The LS corona increases the size of nanoparticles, reduces hydrophobicity, and increases the density of surface phosphate groups. These changes mitigate inflammatory potential and promote recognition and clearance of inhaled nanoparticles. (Hu et al., 2017). \n\nIn addition to biotransformation, LS plays a role in innate immune function.",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

For example, protein coronas that contain apolipoproteins ApoB100 and ApoE improve transport of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (71,72), protein coronas that contain immunoglobulins and complement C3b improve nanoparticle uptake by monocytes (73), and protein coronas that contain albumin (74) and CD47 (75) prevent cellular nanoparticle uptake. The effect of the protein corona on cellular nanoparticle uptake and in vivo distribution of diagnostic USPIOs in patients is a largely understudied area.",

            "text": "The relationship between plasma and LNP concentrations in terms of corona size is not well studied and the dogma regarding corona formation is based largely on historical data produced (by us among others) using solid lipid nanoparticles (e.g., gold or polystyrene) because these are much easier to handle analytically 8 . Our analysis of LNP corona formation indicates that LNPs are associated with HDL particles. This will make the LNPs larger. Interestingly, similar observations to ours, regarding increases in LNP size of up to 120 nm following corona formation, have recently been reported as well 9 . The LNP size increases we observed (using DLS or NTA analysis) following LNP pull-down are, in Simonsen's opinion, excessive. We have previously shown that LNP size does indeed increase in the presence of serum 4 , but the sizes we reported in the current work (Fig. s13 1 ) were obtained, using unfiltered plasma, following the pull-down procedure, in order to characterize the resulting samples. Furthermore, if the pulldown samples were indeed contaminated by lipoproteins, particularly HDL as speculated by Simonsen, the size measurements would likely exhibit a bias towards smaller values-contrary to our observed results. While accurate in situ size measurements of LNPs with coronas were not the main purpose of this procedure, we do find that the LNPs increase in size following exposure to plasma while remaining functionally and structurally intact (in terms of being able to transfect cells and FRET interactions between the LNP cargo and LNP components). \n\nSimonsen also suggests using Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation (AF4) as a standard LNP corona isolation control. In addition to being a relatively slow method unsuitable for high-throughput, we are concerned that particles (endogenous and LNPs) and their coronas may be affected by shear forces during the running and focusing steps and prolonged incubation in a buffer environment. In the study that Simonsen cited, the authors also pointed out that AF4 causes the loss of EVs, for example 10 .",

Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Changes in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25 It has been demonstrated that by designing novel ionizable lipids (ILs) and optimizing LNPs formulations, the type of proteins adsorbed onto the LNPs surface can be influenced, thereby achieving organ-specific delivery. 137 However, although targeting strategies designed via formulation optimization often result in preferential uptake by certain organs, achieving a high level of target cell specificity is rarely realized. Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 nanoparticles) of 50 nm diameter were used as a representative model system to form different coronas in the two conditions. It is known that varying serum amount can lead to formation of different coronas. 28 Then, the effect of serum content on the uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was investigated, and common pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis were used in order to determine potential differences in the mechanisms of uptake in the two conditions. Next, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of the LDL receptor, here selected as a first illustrative example, given the previous reports on its involvement in the uptake of similar silica nanoparticles. 10 This allowed",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

            "text": "Once injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64]. Despite considerable challenges due to the shortage of adequate techniques and protocols for the analysis of the extremely complex nano(protein)",

For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins.

SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76].

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

For example, NPs are capable of targeting tumorassociated macrophages (TAMs) that have been identi\ue103ed as an essential component of the tumor microenvironment. 69 lthough this \ue103eld of research is still in its infancy and the mechanisms that regulate the interaction between TAMs and cancer cells are not yet fully understood, there is general Fig. 2 Impact of biomolecular corona on the immune response. The BC changes nanoparticles' biological identity triggering activation of the immune system. As most plasma proteins are anionic at physiological pH, the biomolecular corona provides nanoparticles with a negative surface charge that generally reduces association and capture by immune cells. Depending on the chemical identity of nanoparticles the biomolecular corona increases particle size and promotes the formation of clusters of various sizes that can be engulfed by circulating and resident macrophages. Immunogenic serum proteins can activate the complement system leading to the clearance of nanoparticles by phagocytes. Conformational changes in the bound proteins may trigger protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. Immunogenic epitope generation caused by protein denaturation activate cell receptors (e.g., the integrin receptor Mac-1) and stimulate signaling pathway leading to the release of inflammatory cytokines.",

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition.",

The specific structure of the corona and its molecular conformation are affected by the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticle, with a lipid bilayer formed on the hydrophilic silver nanoparticle and a lipid monolayer formed on the hydrophobic polystyrene nanoparticle. The wo hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, appear to mediate the formation of the corona by directly interacting with lipids in the corona, with SP-B orienting in parallel to the lipid bilayer and the helical fragment of SP-C adopting a transmembrane orientation. The hydrophilic SP-A was also found associated with the PS corona, mainly via its carbohydrate recognition domain, albeit to a lesser extent of association than SP-B and SP-C. \n\nAlthough the detailed structure and composition of the PS biomolecular corona are yet to be discovered, both MD simulations and mass spectrometry studies suggest that this corona consists of primarily phospholipids, 167,171 hydrophobic surfactant proteins, 144,145 and hydrophilic surfactant proteins. 123,172,173 A fine balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may be involved in the formation of the PS biomolecular corona. 145 The PS corona provides the particles with a physicochemical barrier against the environment, reduces the hydrophobicity of the pristine particles, and enhances biorecognition of the particles. 159 uture Directions in Understanding Aerosol Deposition in the Lung. Although plausible, direct clinical evidence for lung infection by virus-laden aerosols is still lacking. A common objection against the likelihood of aerosol transmission is the seemingly insufficient viral concentration to cause an infection, after individual airborne viral emissions in the form of a sneeze or a cough, or after continuous airborne viral emissions in the form of speaking or breathing. The aerosol volumes generated by an individual sneeze and cough are estimated at 1000 and 100 nL, respectively. 174 The aerosol volumes generated by continuous talking and breathing are estimated at 10 and 1 nL/min, respectively. 174",

The nanoparticle complexed with SA more strongly interacted with the lipid membrane than the nanoparticle alone did, implying that protein adsorption could enhance the nanoparticle-membrane binding [93]. Our group simulated the adsorption of lipids onto gold nanoparticles coated with phenylalanine (Phe), showing the formation of a lipid corona on the surface of gold nanoparticle via electrostatic interactions between charged lipid headgroups and terminal groups of phenylalanine. At low lipid concentrations, unsaturated lipids could form a complete lipid corona around a single gold-Phe nanoparticle, as observed in the experimental observation of lipid corona formation, while saturated lipids only partially coated all gold-Phe nanoparticles, causing them to aggregate [94]. Bai et al. found that the surface charge of nanoparticles significantly influenced their interactions with zwitterionic and anionic lipids, affecting how the lipid bilayer wrapped around the nanoparticle. In addition, differences in lipid composition between the corona and the bulk lipid structure were driven by the nanoparticle's lipid affinity and the intrinsic properties of the lipids themselves [95]. Li et al. found that the preadsorption of SA onto nanoparticles weakened the interactions between nanoparticles and complemented protein C3b and the nanoparticle-membrane binding (Figure 12). This supported experimental observations that SA corona on the nanoparticle surface could inhibit further protein adsorption, thereby prolonging the circulating lifetime [96].",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In vivo, lipid vectors for drug delivery adsorb proteins, lipids and other plasmatic biomolecules on their surface in a non-specific manner once injected: depending on the nanoparticles' properties, such as their charge, hydrophilicity, dimensions and morphology, the several components present in plasma interact and build a coating. The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

            "text": "However, even when testing this hypothesis using PEG-DMG (short-circulating) and PEG-DSG (long-circulating) siRNA-LNPs in a PCa xenograft model, pre-treatment with liposomes did not lead to a significant improvement in LNP circulation times or tumor accumulation (Fig. 3). \n\nBased on the obtained results, we theorize that our LNPs and the liposomes might be cleared by different (sub)populations of RES cells, probably due to varying nanoparticle protein corona profiles (Walkey et al., 2012). The term \"nanoparticle protein corona\" refers to the layer of proteins that adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles when they are present in biological environments, such as blood or tissue (Mahmoudi et al., 2023). This corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' biological behavior, affecting their circulation time, tissue distribution, cellular uptake, and overall efficacy in drug delivery applications (Monopoli et al., 2012;Lynch et al., 2006;Walczyk et al., 2010). Overview of the general experimental workflow for RES blockade in vivo experiments. NU/NU mice bearing PC346C tumors were systemically injected with dextran sulfate (30 mg/kg), liposomes (360 mg/kg) or PBS (control), followed by i.v. injection of siAR-PEG-DSG-LNPs containing 0.2 % DSPE-Cy5.5 at a dose of 5 mg/kg siRNA. Blood samples were collected via submandibular puncture (1 min and 1 h) and cardiac puncture (4 h), and Cy5.5 signal in serum was quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused with PBS and tissues were collected for Cy5.5 and siAR quantification. (B) siAR-LNPs detection in serum at multiple time points as determined by Cy5.5 signal. The serum concentration is represented as a percentage of the directly measured serum fluorescence in individual animals following injection (t = 1 min).",

            "text": "The biomolecular corona A different aspect -which clearly distinguishes nanoparticles from molecular species -of importance for how nanoparticles transport through the blood-brain barrier is the concept of biomolecular corona. 49,50 The biomolecular corona refers to the adsorption of biomolecules from the environment onto the nanoparticle, forming a \"corona\" of biomolecules (Fig. 3A) that covers the original nanoparticle surface (Fig. 3B). The formation of such a corona is important to consider, because in any imaginable way a nanoparticle would come in contact with the blood-brain barrier in vivo, it would do so in the presence of a complex mixture of biomolecules in its environment, all of which could potentially adsorb. Indeed, proteins, 49,51,52 lipids 53-56 and sugars 57,58 have all been found in the corona of different nanoparticles in animal-derived biological media, though the proteins are still the most studied. Furthermore, though which biomolecules adsorb differs, the same general phenomenon of a formation of corona is observed in many biological fluids, 59 from blood serum 50,52,60,61 to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 56 to urine. 59 For nanoparticles approaching the blood-brain barrier, the corona formed in blood serum is perhaps the most important (but not the only; see below) to consider, and this is also the most wellstudied.\n\nIt is a characteristic of the nanoscale, that the adsorption of biomolecules to nanoparticles can be so strong that (some of the) biomolecules will remain with the nanoparticle for much longer than it takes a cell to take up the nanoparticle. [61][62][63][64] This is particularly so for metal, 64 metal oxide 61,62 and other inorganic nanoparticles. 62,63 Still, biomolecular adsorption is sometimes also observed for nanoparticles intended as medicines, e.g., those with grafted ligands, even if PEGylated to prevent unspecific adsorption.

This biocorona is a dynamic and complex structure that determines how host cells respond to nanoparticles. Despite the common use of mouse models in pre-clinical and toxicological experiments, the impact of corona formed in mouse serum on the biophysical and biological properties of different size NP has not been thoroughly explored. Furthering the knowledge on the corona formed on NP exposed to mouse serum proteins can help in understanding what role it might have in in vivo studies at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels. To investigate biocorona formation, different sized polystyrene NP were exposed to mouse serum. Our data show a size- and time-dependent protein and lipid corona formation. Several proteins were identified and apolipoproteins were by far the most common group on the NPs surfaces. Moreover, we observed that cholesterol and triglycerides effectively bind to NP emphasizing that proteins are not the only biomolecules with high-affinity binding to nanomaterial surfaces. These results highlight that further knowledge on NP interactions with mouse serum is necessary regarding the common use of this model to predict the in vivo efficiency of NP.",

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "Recently, Ferreira et al. also measured R h of silica nanoparticles complexed with various plasma proteins, showing that some proteins promote particle aggregation both in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.137 m NaCl) and in phosphate buffer (PB; no salt), while others can induce particle aggregation in PBS but not in PB, which indicate the effect of ionic strength on particle aggregation, to an extent dependent on different proteins. [21] These experiments have revealed the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on nanoparticle aggregation, although the mechanism has not yet been clearly understood, which requires the understanding of particle-protein and protein-protein interactions at nearly the atomic scale. \n\n[50] To understand the corona-induced aggregation, discrete simulations were performed by Li et al. [51] and Pilkington et al., [52] showing polypeptide aggregation in the presence of nanosheets, [51] lysozyme and eLact proteins. [52] Our group's coarse-grained (CG) simulations captured that the lipid-corona formation induces aggregation of 12 nm-sized spherical Au particles, depending on the lipid type and concentration. [53] Recently, Liu et al.'s allatom simulations showed that the adsorption of extracellular substances such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids reduces aggregation of nanoplastics because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. [54] Although these simulations have been able to explore the effects of corona components and their concentrations on peptide or particle aggregation, they have been performed using an implicit-solvent model or using an explicit-solvent model with only very limited system sizes, which are not always easy to accurately assess aggregation of multiple copies of relatively large nanoparticles bound to plasma proteins with consideration of their interactions with solvents. In particular, the aggregation extent and hydrodynamics (i.e., the change of R h ) of nanoparticles coated with different proteins and their concentrations at different ionic strengths have not so far been systematically studied through MD simulations.",

            "text": "Besides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane.

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

            "text": "The interaction of nanoparticles with physiological systems-the so-called \"nano-bio interface\"-is a complex process. It is therefore important to understand this mechanism in some detail before we delve into strategies to bypass first-pass metabolism. As we discussed, a nanoparticle's inherent composition, shape, size, and surface chemistry plays a crucial part in deciding its fate in systemic circulation. In this section, we discuss the role of two external parameters that play equally vital roles to affect circulation stability and the final disposition of a nanoparticle to the tumor: (i) formation of a protein corona and (ii) the mechanism of interactions between the nanoparticle and cells. \n\nWhen a nanoparticle enters the blood, it is coated with various serum proteins, forming a protein corona that changes the nanoparticle's synthetic identity, exposes new epitopes, and alters its function. The concept of a protein corona is thus an important parameter in shaping the final biological identity of the nanoparticle-hydrodynamic size, surface chemistry, net charge, and aggregation behavior [30,32,64]. Although this has been known for a long time, it is only recently that researchers were able to decipher the complex mixture of adsorbed proteins on nanoparticles. This was mainly led by the advancement of instrumentation and analytical methods, coupled with the motivation to shake the existing stagnancy of clinical translation for nanomedicine delivery systems [65][66][67]. Albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulins, transferrin, fibrinogen, complement C3, haptoglobin, and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin are some of the most abundant proteins that comprise the protein corona [32,68]. Nanoparticles interact with these proteins mainly through long range electrostatic Van der Waal's forces, as well as short-range hydrophobic interactions [33]. There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin.",

[66] Blood is thicker than water -the impact of corona formation on blood system physiology As the perturbation of physiological systems by nanoparticles has recently been reviewed, 27,67,68 we here focus on novel insights into the role of the protein corona for the blood system. \n\nWhen designed for nanomedical applications, such as drug delivery or imaging, nanoparticle administration often requires intravenous injections. 2,69 Hence, detailed knowledge about the physical and chemical aspects associated with the behaviour of NPs in the complex protein-rich environment of the blood system is thus key for (re)shaping the future of nanobiomedicine. As the complete plasma proteome reference set contains more than two thousand different proteins, 70 such knowledge is particularly relevant for plasma proteins. 4,6,26,28,71 Indeed, the plasma protein corona has recently been shown to be indeed highly complex as well. 6 roteins involved in physiological as well as toxicological relevant processes in the blood system, such as to complement activation and coagulation, have been identified in the coronas of various NPs. 4,6,26,28,44,71,72 The identified proteins span about three to four orders of magnitude dynamic range, most likely covering most biologically relevant corona proteins. 6 Notably, the respective abundance of all of these proteins was affected by The early phase: a highly complex corona is established already in 30 sec, which may be composed of multiple coreshell structures ('new').

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

It plays an important role in the colloidal stability of NPs, which is of importance for most of their medical applications and toxicity assessment. While typical studies use either blood plasma or serum from a pooled biobank, it is unclear whether differences in the media, such as cholesterol level or protein concentration, might affect the NP colloidal stability and corona composition. In this study, the silica corona was prepared at particularly low plasma concentrations (3%, v/v\u20131.98 mg/mL) to identify the critical roles of the protein mass/NP surface ratio and the level of plasma cholesterol on the corona protein pattern and particle stability. While depending on the plasma dilution factor, the corona protein composition could be controlled by keeping the protein/NP constant. The NP colloidal stability was found to strongly correlate with the level of cholesterol in human plasma, particularly due to the high enrichment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the corona. A cohort study on plasma samples from individuals with known cholesterol levels was performed to highlight that association, which could be relevant for all corona systems enriched with the LDL.",

However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

When nanocarriers come into contact with serum, proteins immediately adsorb onto their surface, forming a protein corona which defines their biological identity. Although the composition of the protein corona has been widely determined by proteomics, its morphology still remains unclear. In this study we show for the first time the morphology of the protein corona using transmission electron microscopy. We are able to demonstrate that the protein corona is not, as commonly supposed, a dense, layered shell coating the nanoparticle, but an undefined, loose network of proteins. Additionally, we are now able to visualize and discriminate between the soft and hard corona using centrifugation-based separation techniques together with proteomic characterization. The protein composition of the \u223c15 nm hard corona strongly depends on the surface chemistry of the respective nanomaterial, thus further affecting cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. Large diameter protein corona resulting from pre-incubation with soft corona or Apo-A1 inhibits cellular uptake, confirming the stealth-effect mechanism. In summary, the knowledge on protein corona formation, composition and morphology is essential to design therapeutic effective nanoparticle systems.",

Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

            "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

            "text": "Synthetic nanoparticles and EVs in biological milieus are surrounded by layers of adsorbed biomolecules, collectively referred to as the biomolecular corona. [82] The corona dynamically changes as nanoparticles traverse between various extracellular and intracellular compartments in the body. [83] The components in the biomolecular corona impact the biological identity of EVs, including immunological recognition and clearance (Figure 5). In particular, opsonins in the blood circulation play pivotal roles in mediating nanoparticle and extracellular vesicle uptake by innate immune cells. [84] Opsonins include complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and coagulation factors. Such opsonins may also cause a cascade effect where one opsonin causes the binding of others. For example, immunoglobulins on the biomolecular corona of synthetic nanoparticles attract complement proteins. [85] Notably, proteomic analysis revealed that EVs released by metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibit a substantial abundance of complement protein H (regulator of the alternative complement pathway). [86] Complement protein H on these EVs facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by suppressing the activation of other complement proteins, resulting in evasion of the complement system. Therefore, the addition of complement regulatory factors on the EV surface may offer a promising approach to mitigate the complement response and reduce immunological recognition and clearance, as shown for synthetic nanoparticles. [87] Furthermore, decreasing the cholesterol content of EV mimetics reduced the adsorption of complement on the surface, [88] indicating that cholesterol content may also impact the immune clearance of EVs. \n\nOther abundant components in the biomolecular corona of EVs are lipoproteins and/or their protein components (apolipoproteins). [83] Varying affinities for lipoproteins impact the interactions between EVs and cells, including immune cells. [89] Lipoproteins are considered a major contaminant of EVs due to overlapping physical characteristics, [90] and methods have been developed to reduce lipoprotein abundance following EV isolation.

            "text": "The corona formed on MLNCs is not similar to the coronas in the form of a uniform cloud around metal and polymer NPs presented in a number of publications [10,[23][24][25]. We believe that the shape of the corona on the MLNC is due to the uneven surface properties of the lipid-peptide envelope of this nanoconstruct, as well as the high diversity of proteins in the serum. \n\nEvidence in favor of this assumption comes from recent publications on corona studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are naturally occurring lipid-enveloped NPs and play important roles in many physiological processes. The uneven distribution of transmembrane proteins in the EV membrane, shown by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, may determine the uneven binding of environmental proteins to the membrane, followed by \"uneven\" corona on the surface of the vesicles described [26]. \n\nThe formation of a corona consisting of large protein aggregates randomly sorbed on the surface of EVs was demonstrated using confocal microscopy [27]. The belonging of these aggregates to the protein corona was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and changes in membrane structure of naked and coronated EVs on ultrathin sections. These results reflect the complexity of the interaction of the lipid membranes of natural EVs with environmental proteins and are not surprising. We think that the structure of the corona observed on MLNC is consistent with the corona variants described in [27]. \n\nOn the surface of MLNCs bearing a corona, spherical electron-dense particles (20-50 nm) are sometimes found (Figure 14H). In the center of the particles, a \"light\" core, surrounded by an uneven layer of high electron density, can be recognized. The structure and size of these particles make it possible to identify them as lipoproteins (non-vesicles) present in serum and other biological fluids [28,29]. \n\nThe appearance of a full corona on the surface of the MLNCs after UV irradiation allows us to conclude that it was the fixation of the components of the soft corona to the hard (\"invisible\" in TEM) that made it possible to obtain a visible, complete corona.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

Cationic delivery systems for nucleic acids often reveal pulmonary toxicity [65] that has been associated with clogging of small lung capillaries [66]. Aggregation of nanoparticles by serum proteins that we observe in TEM experiment might exacerbate this even more. However, aggregation of PF14-SCO nanoparticles in real in vivo conditions after administration is probably less extensive than in static conditions applied here due to dynamic flow and shear stress that strongly influence the structure and composition of biomolecular corona [67,68].",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

LNPs have been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting, in which LNP\u2019s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. In a popular approach, physicochemical targeting is accomplished by formulating with charged lipids. Negatively charged lipids localize LNPs to the spleen, and positively charged lipids to the lungs. Here we found that lung-tropic LNPs employing cationic lipids induce massive thrombosis. We demonstrate that thrombosis is induced in the lungs and other organs, and greatly exacerbated by pre-existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non-LNP nanoparticles. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to fibrinogen and inducing platelet and thrombin activation. Based on these mechanisms, we engineered multiple solutions which enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while not inducing thrombosis. Our findings implicate thrombosis as a major barrier that blood erects against LNPs with cationic components and illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re-engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.",

The incubation of mRNA-lipoplexes (made with Lipofectamine 2000 \u00ae ), with different concentrations of fetal bovine serum (FBS), results in a decrease in transfection efficiency (from 92% of transfected cells at 0% FBS to 31% at 10% FBS), with increase in onset time delivery (1.6 h at 0% FBS and 2.9 h at 10% FBS), and a decrease in expression rate. Interestingly, when LNPs are used (made using ionizable lipid Dlin-MC3-DMA), the opposite behavior is observed. Regarding these results, an essential parameter to take into consideration for the intracellular fate of the mRNA particles is the protein corona formed after interaction with biological fluids (e.g., FBS) [114,115].

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

            "text": "Despite their clinical successes, our understanding of how and which biological components in complex biofluids, including blood, LNPs interact with, and the impact of such interactions on the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of LNP-based therapeutic products are still sparse and almost entirely limited to interactions with apolipoprotein E (apoE). To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

            "text": "After intravenous administration, nanocarriers are exposed to a several sequential hurdles that must be overcome in order to efficiently reach therapeutic levels of drugs at disease sites, avoiding nonspecific uptake in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). As per the literature, when nanocarriers are intravenously administered, they can interact with thousands of proteins. Biological media consists of numerous active biomolecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and blood plasma contains roughly 3,700 identified proteins (Lazarovits et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2017). Protein corona effect i.e. due to the presence of charge on nanocarriers can result into interaction with oppositely charged serum protein. Thus, nanocarriers or the targeting moiety decorated over nanocarriers get buried in protein corona resulting into prevention of nanocarriers's interaction with the targeted receptor in cancer cells (Tonigold et al., 2018). Opsonins are key proteins in the blood serum that promotes elimination of vulnerable nanocarriers by marking them off for an immune response. The major part of opsonized nanocarriers are cleared within seconds by a receptor-mediated mechanism because of the phagocytic cells in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen of the mononuclear phagocyte system, contributing to nonspecific distribution of nanocarriers in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). \n\nOne most established strategy to mitigate the effect of protein corona involves the nanocarrier functionalization with amphiphilic or hydrophilic polymers, such as poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) (Bros et al., 2018). PEG forms strong adhered hydration layer, which sterically avoid the interaction/adsorption of serum protein (Huo et al., 2019). PEG-decorated nanocarrriers reduce their recognition by the components of the mononuclear phagocytic system, increasing their blood circulation time (Xiong et al., 2009;Naeye et al., 2010).",

            "text": "To systematically study the LNPs and their newly formed corona, the unbound proteins must be separated after their in vivo administration or in vitro incubation with blood, plasma, or serum. However, a precise characterization of the BMC of soft nanomaterials, such as LNPs has proven difficult as the size and density of LNPs are similar to \"natural\" serum nanoparticles, for instance, chylomicrons, HDL, exosomes, and many more (19). \n\nCommon separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or (ultra)centrifugation are based on, respectively, size or density, and therefore they can work well for the study of bigger or dense NPs (23) but do not allow an effective separation of LNP (30 to 100 nm) from lipoproteins and related nanostructures (7 to 80 nm) present in biological media (19). In addition, as a high g-force is commonly required in (ultra)centrifugation, proteins and LNP can aggregate and induce artifacts resulting in difficulty differentiating between unbound vs. adsorbed proteins. The lack of effective and high-throughput separation techniques for soft nanomaterials has led to alternative procedures such as cross-linking proteins on the LNP surface (24,25). This effectively removes the presence of unbounded proteins but potentially disrupts the proteins present on an intact LNP surface. Furthermore, a photoaffinity lipid probe is required in the LNP formulation which can also alter the BMC formation and profile due to deviations from clinically relevant lipid compositions. In some cases, affinity assays have been used for isolating the corona of PEGylated nanomedicines (26). However, since many affinity-based assays rely on ligand binding to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, LNPs that contains diffusible PEG that are engineered to shed from the particle surface (i.e., Onpattro) may not be suitable for this method. \n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a magnetic separation (MS) technique that enables the study of LNP's BMC in a manner that is independent of their surface properties.",

Here, we discuss the mechanistic parameters that are involved in the protein corona formation and the consequences of this corona formation for both, the particle, and the protein. We review consequences of corona formation for colloidal stability and discuss the role of functional groups and NP surface functionalities in shaping NP\u2013protein interactions. We also elaborate the recent advances demonstrating the strong involvement of Coulomb-type interactions between NPs and charged patches on the protein surface. Moreover, we discuss novel aspects related to the complexity of the protein corona forming under physiological conditions in full serum. Specifically, we address the relation between particle size and corona composition and the latest findings that help to shed light on temporal evolution of the full serum corona for the first time. Finally, we discuss the most recent advances regarding the molecular-scale mechanistic role of the protein corona in cellular uptake of NPs.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles are presented to a physiological environment such as human plasma they selectively absorb biomolecules to form a so-called biomolecular corona on the surface of the nanoparticle [9]. Needless to say, one should be aware of the fact that nanoparticles -indeed, any material surfaces -may be coated with bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane component of all Gram-negative bacteria, especially if the nanoparticles are synthesised under non-sterile conditions. This could give rise to interference with the biological assessment of nanomaterials eg. induction of maturation of dendritic cells (DC) [10]. However, of more importance for the present discussion, several studies in recent years have provided evidence for a \"hard\" (long-lived) corona of human plasma proteins on nanoparticles of different chemical composition [11][12][13][14]; the formation of the hard corona was shown to depend on both size and surface properties eg. degree of hydrophobicity [15]. The bio-corona has been reported to impact on cellular uptake [16] and on cell signaling including NF-\u043aB-dependent cytokine production in THP.1 cells [17]. Notably, lipids, not only proteins, may also feature prominently in the bio-corona, as shown recently for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) administered into the lungs of mice [18], and the combined lipid-protein corona may play a role in cellular uptake of nanomaterials. The notion that naked particle surfaces may not exist in nature has profound implications as the bio-corona may convey a new biological \"identity\" to nanoparticles [19]. This is, in a manner of speaking, a case of the Emperor\u00b4s new clothes in reverse; hence, the Emperor is not naked as we thought but fully \"clothed\" in a layer of biomolecules. In fact, some studies have even provided detailed information on the thickness of this layer, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [20].",

            "text": "Most nanoparticle-based formulations have been designed for intravenous administration to spread deeper to organ tissue without surgery. These nanovectors interact with the biological system, mainly with the circulatory proteins, upon being available into the systemic circulation. One set of proteins binds with nanoparticles' surface and forms a protein corona (PC) conjugate. After adhering, this PC makes the particles recognized by the innate immune system followed by quicker elimination by phagocytic cells present in the liver, lungs, and spleen. Additionally, these PCs increase the physical disability and agglomeration of particles. To overcome this problem, the utmost requirement is to develop new strategies to minimize PC formation with improved stability and circulatory time of nanovectors (Rampado et al., 2020). The composition and kinetics of PC vary (decrease or increase) over time. It was believed that the PCs are responsible for the instability of NPs. However, a separate study demonstrated the aggregation of nanoparticles inversely proportion with protein [human serum albumin (HSA), fibrinogen, immunoglobulin, and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1)] concentration (Ho et al., 2018). It was observed that NPs aggregation was increased at lower protein concentrations, whereas these NPs were stable at higher protein concentrations. The interaction of the protein with the nanoparticles is varied based on the type of protein. \n\nImmunoglobulin and fibrinogens are sticky proteins either form clotting or bind with foreign bodies, whereas HAS and APOA1 interact with more NPs simultaneously to form bridges. \n\nThe concentration and tagged surfactants charged on NPs determine the PC characters (Zhang et al., 2019). Charges on NPs were changed after the formation of PC. Particles with negative charge persisted, whereas positively charged particles acquired a negative charge. Ovisprin-1 and lysozyme protein coronas were tested on plain gold nanoparticles to understand the protein corona formation in an aqueous environment (Jahan Sajib et al., 2020). It was observed that the appearance of PC is caused due to protein-protein interaction and protein's surface and hydrophobic surface effect.",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

According to different adsorption theories, this process is energetically favorable due to a rather higher net binding energy compared to the surrounding environment, increasing the NP size by 3-35 nm and the NP surface charge to 10-20 mV [5]. The corona profile is shaped by various ambient factors, including the biomolecule concentration, pH, ionic strength, temperature, and incubation time. Once the corona forms, the nanoparticle's identity undergoes a transformation, altering its physicochemical properties, targeting capabilities, and biological responses. These changes arise from the new biological identity imparted by the adsorbed proteins \n\nThe protein corona is composed of an inner layer of tightly bound/stronger affinity proteins with a longer lifetime (\"hard corona\", HC) and an outer layer of weakly bound proteins with a shorter lifetime (\"soft corona\", SC). HCs are more easily isolated and characterized: examples of NPs with HCs include liposomes, quantum dots, metallic NPs, silica NPs, polymeric NPs, and 2D materials [5]. HCs form gradually, are more stable, and comprise \"relatively immobile\" proteins with strong affinities for NP surfaces and low tendencies to dissociate. Soft coronas, consisting of biomolecules like proteins with low affinities for NP surfaces, undergo dynamic and reversible changes influenced by the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. Understanding both soft and hard coronas is essential for interpreting NP stability, functionality, and interactions with biological systems.",

Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "Third, regardless of the nature of the amine introduced (primary, secondary, or tertiary), these lipids were able to efficiently encapsulate mRNA. Thio-lipids may rely on more than electrostatic interactions between the positively charged ionizable headgroup and negatively charged mRNA phosphates to form LNPs with high encapsulation efficiency-\u03c0-\u03c0 and sigma hole interactions with mRNA may also be implicated in the encapsulation process (22)(23)(24)(25). The lipids that failed to quantitatively encapsulate mRNA had either steric or solubility constraints. However, not all these lipids could deliver mRNA into cytoplasm. Investigating the cpKa of the most potent lipids and experimental pKa of the LNP formulations revealed no clear correlation between lipid efficacy and ionizability. For example, lipid 20b contained only a secondary amine incorporated into the thiophene backbone structure yet was more potent than its modified counterpart. Moreover, the resulting LNPs had an unusual pH response profile, suggesting a partial positive charge across a broad pH range. We acknowledge that more work is needed to fully understand the structure-activity relationship of these lipids. \n\nOrgan-specific delivery via LNPs and nanomedicines can be achieved via either active targeting [i.e., targeting ligands (21,26,27)] or passive targeting (i.e., specific properties of the nanoparticle such as size or charge). Little is understood about the adjustments required to achieve passive targeting for specific organs; however, strong evidence suggests that the nature of the biomacromolecular corona formed on the nanoparticle surface may direct the delivery to specific organs (28)(29)(30)(31). For example, ionizable but not cationic LNPs can bind to apolipoprotein E and utilize low-density lipoprotein receptor to enter hepatic tissues (32). The LNP ionization seems to be a major determinant in the corona composition, although LNP reorganization upon exposure to serum proteins may also contribute to this phenomenon (31).",

Because loss of nanoparticles during the nebulization blocks delivering nucleic acids to the lungs via inhalation, 11 discovery of novel structural lipids that make LNPs resilient to the use of nebulizer will substantially improve efficacy of gene therapies.\n\nIn summary, these studies reinforce the potential of structural lipids to target different organs. First, the presence of structural lipids at nanoparticle surface post PEG shedding makes them an important partner for serum proteins to form a corona. The composition of the protein corona on different nanoparticles is an active area of research. 7,26 Ability to mitigate corona formation can enable LNPs to reach tissues beyond the liver. On the other hand, the surface can be designed to adsorb proteins which exploit processes that traverse impenetrable organs like the brain or propel the nanocarriers across lung endothelium. Second, the membrane lipids can play an important role in the formulation of nanoparticles based on routes of administration. For example, when delivered through inhalation, the structural lipid can impart a valuable feature to the nanocarrier, i.e., maintain its structure and ability to transfect after nebulization. Such fea-tures are necessary for developing inhalable mRNA nanoformulations for treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis, COVID-19, asthma, or lung cancer that can be benefited by direct access to the lungs. Finally, it is unclear whether the membrane lipids directly engage with the process of endosomal escape. However, based on the differences within in vitro transfections with use of different structural lipids, one may speculate that the structural lipid perhaps contributes to LNP disassembly and resulting cytosolic delivery of RNA. The discovery of natural products that undergo conformational changes once inside an endosome can lead to potent nanocarriers for intracellular gene delivery.",

            "text": "This makes particle collisions, which are required to induce aggregation processes following second order kinetics [109], less likely and colloidal stability will increase upon dilution. Based on the above mentioned three determining factors it may be concluded that ligand-free colloids may only be used as primary particles in biological assays when they are highly diluted, while at higher concentrations mainly aggregates have to be considered. However, the fate of nanoparticles in biological fluids is not only dictated by electrostatic effects. Nanoparticles are known to spontaneously react with organic medium components, predominantly serum proteins, which rapidly (<0.5 min) form a stable protein corona on the nanoparticles [110], known to stabilize the particles against aggregation by sterical effects [111]. The mechanism of protein corona formation is still under vivid debate, though it is generally believed that proteins with high affinities strongly bind to the nanoparticle surface forming a hard corona, while other proteins more loosely bound form a soft corona. The corona is reported to be highly dynamic. Depending on the medium more abundant proteins are quickly adsorbed but gradually replaced by proteins with higher affinity [112,113]. However, more recent studies involving the timeresolved screening of 300 blood proteins by proteomics seems to indicate that the time resolved changes in the composition of the corona are not that pronounced [110]. However, proteinnanoparticle interactions for totally ligand-free nanoparticles have not been extensively studied [68], though it is reported that protein deformation is more likely to occur on bare nanoparticle surfaces [111]. In order to examine the influence of protein stabilization on ligand-free nanoparticles, albumin may be an appropriate model substance, which is known to be abundant in the protein corona and is one of the most frequent proteins in serum-containing cell culture media [114]. It was recently shown that ligand-free laser-fabricated gold nanoparticles could be successfully stabilized by albumin [81]. Additionally, the required albumin concentration is dependent on the ionic strength of the medium (Figure 8A), most likely caused by the interplay between two opposing forces, namely steric stabilization by albumin and destabilization by screening of surface charges at higher salinities.",

            "text": "When NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface [7,8].The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,7].\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) [5,30,[35][36][37] and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) [7,35,38].The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface [30,39,40].For example, experimental data [41] and the results of a simulation model [40] suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8,36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety.",

Nanoparticles will rapidly adsorb proteins forming what is known as the protein \"corona\" after enters the circulation system. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would in uence the biological identity of nanoparticles [28] . The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29] . Understanding nanoparticle-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30] . The physiological environment to which nanoparticles are rst exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with nanoparticles to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing in ammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31] . \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases. This article focuses on polymer nanoparticles and explores their bioactivity impact on the development of AS and physiochemical mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study of the effects of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, which are widely used in a variety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapeutic devices, on the development of aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

In these additional blood circulation assays, liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), 188kPa@lipid, and PLGA@lipid were used as the representatives for nanoparticles with extremely low ApoA1 abundance in corona, nanoparticles with appreciably high ApoA1 abundance in corona, and nanoparticles with intermediate ApoA1 abundance in corona, respectively; ApoA1 abundance in corona is observed to be ~0% for liposome, ~8% for PLGA@lipid, and ~26% for 188kPa@lipid (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a). Our addition blood circulation assays (Figure 3j) show that, for liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), pre-treating the liposome-protein complex with ApoA1 antibody failed to appreciably affect the complex's blood clearance half-life (9 h and 9.6 h with and without the ApoA1 antibody treatment, respectively) (Figure 3j), which is easy to understand considering the extremely low abundance of ApoA1 in its corona (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a). In stark contrast, for 188kPa@lipid nanoparticle, pre-treating the nanoparticle-protein complex with ApoA1 antibody significantly reduced the complex's blood clearance half-life (Figure 3j",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

As a fundamental step towards tuning the immune system by BC, the nanotechnologist will carefully understand factors regulating the bionano interactions, i.e., the interaction between NPs and biomolecules leading to BC formation. 40 e biomolecular corona of nanoparticles Upon exposure to biological media abundant and high exchange rate proteins rapidly cover the particle surface which results in the formation of a fast-evolving \"so\ue09d\" BC made of loosely bound proteins. 41 Over time high-affinity proteins with a very slow exchange rate undermine the so\ue09d BC and form a long-standing \"hard\" BC around NPs. 42 Typically, most studies focused on the characterization of the hard corona as the characterization of the so\ue09d corona is affected by experimental biases arising from the lack of precise protocols for its isolation. For this reason, many open-ended questions have long remained elusive including if the so\ue09d corona is different in composition from its hard counterpart, and whether proteins enriching the so\ue09d BC trigger nanoparticle-cellular interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that only a minor fraction of proteins is unique to so\ue09d BC, while the largest fraction is also present in the hard BC, showing that the same proteins can interact strongly or weakly with nanoparticles or pre-adsorbed neighboring proteins. \n\n9][50] Among them, the protein source (e.g., human vs. mouse serum) is surely the factor contributing most to the enrichment of the biomolecular corona with immunogenic proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement proteins). For instance, Caracciolo et al. demonstrated that two different formulations of cationic liposomes were more enriched in immunogenic proteins following exposure to human plasma (HP) than they were a\ue09der exposure to mouse plasma (MP). 51",

            "text": "In the second maturation step, removal of ethanol by dialysis against physiological buffer (pH 7.4) deprotonates the ionizable lipid and stabilizes LNPs. Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

            "text": "Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73). Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as potent carriers for mRNA delivery, but several challenges remain before this approach can offer broad clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics. To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes.",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

Using core-shell nanoparticles with a same PEGylated lipid bilayer shell yet cores differing in elasticity (45 kPa \u2013 760 MPa) as models, we isolate the effects of nanoparticle elasticity from those of other physiochemical parameters and, using mouse models, observe a non-monotonic relationship of systemic circulation lifetime versus nanoparticle elasticity. Incubating our nanoparticles in mouse plasma provides protein coronas varying non-monotonically in composition depending on nanoparticle elasticity. Particularly, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) is the only protein whose relative abundance in corona strongly correlates with our nanoparticles\u2019 blood clearance lifetime. Notably, similar results are observed when above nanoparticles\u2019 PEGylated lipid bilayer shell is changed to be non-PEGylated. This work unveils the mechanisms by which nanoparticle elasticity affects nanoparticles\u2019 physiological fate and suggests nanoparticle elasticity as a readily tunable parameter in future rational exploiting of protein corona. Nanoparticle elasticity is known to affect physiological fate but how this occurs is largely unknown. Here, the authors report on a study using nanoparticles differing in elasticity alone to show a difference in the protein corona, in particular apolipoprotein A-1 absorption, corresponds to differences in circulation time.",

            "text": "While surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

            "text": "So far, most studies on the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells have adopted either serum-free conditions or dispersion in standard cell culture medium supplemented with a low amount of (bovine) serum. Serum is added to cell cultures simply for providing nutrients to cells. However, the presence of biological fluids has much more profound effects on the interactions of nanosized objects with cells, due to the adsorption of molecules on their surface and corona formation. 7 Cell receptors can recognize and engage with such corona proteins, and overall it is known that this layer strongly affects the subsequent interactions with cells. 10 Given that corona proteins can be recognized by specific cell receptors, it comes natural to wonder whether this layer can also affect the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized objects. Recent works have shown that the presence or absence of a corona has an impact on the mechanisms cells use to internalize nanosized materials. 64,65 However, it is not known whether the corona composition (as opposed to simply the presence of a corona) also matters. This is of particular importance given that the same nanoparticles can form very different coronas depending on the biological fluid in which they are applied (thus the exposure route or, for nanomedicines, the administration route) and also on its concentration. 7,66 The implications can be profound. For instance, in vivo, nanoparticles in blood encounter much higher serum concentrations than what is usually applied in in vitro studies (passivating nanomedicines by exposure to serum prior to their administration in vivo may be considered in the future as an approach to try to control uncertainties related to changes in corona composition). Indeed, our results suggest that the corona composition can affect the initial recognition by cell receptors and, as a result, the same nanoparticle can be internalized by cells using different mechanisms when different coronas are formed. Potential subtle differences in nanoparticle stability for different coronas could also contribute in part to similar differences and should also be considered.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the components of the BP-corona complex. The results revealed that the binding of proteins to BP directly depends on the protein size and, additionally, the BPNSs mainly bind with immune relevant proteins. The composition of the protein corona can also be evaluated using Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

            "text": "The corona detected for the 76 nm sample in the whole blood samples resembled apolipoprotein A-I with aprominent band, rather than the 9.5 nm sample. In serum, the detected corona was in a changeover from 9.5 to the 76 nm NPs i.e., the quantity of apolipoprotein A-I reduced with the increase in NP size due to the change in size or curvature of the NPs [33]. Besides the particle size, the PC detected around the NPs also depended upon parameters such as the composition of the biological medium, and the fraction of the particle surface area in direct contact with the biological medium. \n\nIf the surface area of the NPs is large i.e., if a large number of particles are present in a given area, a low affinity protein may bind and stabilize the interaction with the aggregates of NPs. The exposed surface area may also reflect the protein-compelled NP aggregation. The trapped protein in the complex can be analyzed after its release from the NP-protein corona complex although it is not a part of corona composition. The large surface area aggregates of the corona with diversified proteins have been explained in previous work [34,35]. \n\nWalczyk et al. conducted a study on several normal nanoparticles dispersed in blood plasma to investigate the formation and categorization of (hard or soft) PC assembly and their longevity. Herein, the authors used carboxylated polystyrene particles (PSCOOH), sulfonated polystyrene particles of sizes 100 and 200 nm, and silica particles of size 50 nm incubated in normal plasma. The results are shown in Figure 4a-f. In Figure 4a, it can be seenall the changes in the peaks during incubation were reproducible. Figure 4b shows that the protein complex monomer and the bigger protein-particle complexes were retained with unaltered sizes as in the plasma in situ. Figure 4c,d indicates that the particles werepolydisperse in nature, and that protein conformation is affected by the method of sample preparation. Moreover, the size of corona particle was observed to be 5 nm larger than the bare nanoparticle (Figure 4e).",

Comprehensive studies of corona formation are thus essential to analyse the toxicity of nanoparticles with cells and tissues.

The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

Coverage with albumin has been shown to reduce the lysosomal degradation of nanoparticles in endothelial cells and, therefore, extend the circulation time of particles [47,71]. Furthermore, albumin facilitates transport of nanoparticles from the site of injection to peripheral tissues [60], endocytosis [72] and transcytosis across capillary endothelium [73]. In addition, other plasma proteins involved in binding, transport, and mediating availability of various biomolecules in the bloodstream (e.g., apolipoproteins, \u03b1-2-HS-glycoprotein (also known as fetuin-A), serotransferrin etc.) and proteins involved in blood coagulation and haemostasis (e.g., \u03b1-2-macroglobulin, prothrombin, fibrinogen, \u03b1-1-antitrypsin etc.) were identified in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles.

            "text": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a biological fluid, such as serum, proteins and peptides adsorb onto the particle's surface, forming a nanoparticle-protein corona (NPPC) complex [1][2][3]. The protein cloud develops a new surface on the nanoparticle, impacting the interactions between the nanoparticle and the surrounding environment. The NPPC complex assumes the characteristics of a core-shell particle system, where the pristine particle is the \"core\" and the corona is the \"shell\" [4]. This creates a new interface between the pristine particle and the surrounding biological fluid. The formation of a protein corona has been shown to change the particle's biological effects [5][6][7][8]. In addition to this change in the particle's characteristics, the adsorbed proteins have the potential to undergo conformational changes. Changes in either set of properties are especially important for nanomaterial drug products [9][10][11][12][13]. The cloak of proteins around particles in biological fluids has been shown to enhance or diminish a particle's specificity to a desired location, incite or inhibit its ability to permeate into a cell, and heighten or mitigate a biochemical response. When a protein corona forms, it is more likely to distribute and become available due to the nano-bio interface that forms around the surface of the nanoparticle. This protein cloud can change the biodistribution of the nanoparticle system depending on the biomolecular composition formed around the surface. Consequently, if the drug is reliant on specific proteins binding to the surface of the nanoparticle, then the particle could be translocated into an unintended location if non-targeted proteins form around the particle. \n\nResearch efforts in the field of nanotoxicology have strived to relate (or correlate) particle properties to adverse health effects. There now exists a substantial amount of published literature on this topic; however, there is no general consensus on identifying physicochemical characteristics as predictors of toxicological responses.",

            "text": "The complexes formed by NPs with proteins and sugars are described as protein coronas (PCs). \n\nAs PCs travel through the body, interactions with different molecules occur and the coronas may dissolve, form conglomerates or even new compounds with unique properties. This process is known as \"from synthetic to biological identity\" and describes changes from the NPs properties designed in the laboratory to those gained by their interaction with a specific biological environment. This means that any NPs exposed to the body may form biological medium-related, unique coronas, which exert some impact on both antibacterial and toxicological activities. 7][78] Several factors play a role in the whole interaction process between NPs and protein-rich biological fluids. Lundqvist et al. 12 showed that the size of the NPs influenced this process due to the curvature effect in human blood serum. They proved this in a study where silica nanoparticles of the same type but of various sizes differently influenced the binding of A-lipoprotein from human blood. The smaller the NPs, the greater the number of proteins that bound as PCs. Also, they showed that the bigger the NP size, the more up-regulated the thrombin-generation assay. The authors, therefore, showed that the same NPs, but of various sizes, may affect the organism response in different ways. Also, Ajdar et al. 76 showed that gold nanoparticles added to human blood generated a faster prothrombotic response (in a nonlinear size dependent manner). They also showed the concentration dependent manner of the prothrombogenic effects and reduction of time until initial clot formation. Moreover, they noticed that clot strength decreased significantly in line with the size of the NPs added. 76 he aforementioned studies confirmed the extreme diversification of the interactions between NPs and biological fluids. Few studies have yet evaluated PC formation in the oral cavity, or sufficiently explained their impact on the oral mucosa and its permeability. 3",

[48] The adsorption affinity of these plasma proteins to LLC nanoparticles (i.e., the protein corona effects) is somewhat dependent on the choice of steric stabilizers and the lipid phases formed. For a system based on MO/medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), Wibroe et al. compared the stabilization effect against serum using the anionic surfactant citrem and the nonionic amphiphilic polymer Plu-F127. [49] Similar to that observed in cell culture media, [44] a short incubation in human serum (for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C) slightly increased the lattice parameter (a) and median diameter (d) of the binary dispersions stabilized by Plu-F127 (LD F127 ) and that by citrem (LD citrem ) (Figure 3a). [49] t was clearly shown that the L 2 phase (LD citrem3.0 ) is more sensitive to the protein corona effects (with \u224820% size increment) than the corresponding H 2 phase (LD citrem1.5 , \u22485% increase). As speculated by the authors, this is possibly due to more efficient trapping of the serum proteins in the L 2 \"swollen\" micellar aqueous cores in comparison with that of the H 2 cylindrical nanochannels. 52][53] On the other hand, the chemical structure of PHY does not possess an ester group, and it is therefore considered \"nondigestible\" from an esterase perspective, precluding an impact of chemical changes on self-assembled structure when this PHY particle system is exposed to plasma.",

About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are promising tools for nanomedicine in a wide array of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Yet, despite the advances in the biomedical applications of nanomaterials, relatively few nanomedicines made it to the clinics. The formation of the biomolecular corona on the surface of nanoparticles has been known as one of the challenges toward successful targeting of nanomedicines. This adsorbed protein layer can mask targeting moieties and creates a new biological identity that critically affects the subsequent biological interactions of nanomedicines with cells. Extensive studies have been directed toward understanding the characteristics of this layer of biomolecules and its implications for nanomedicine outcomes at cell and organism levels, yet several aspects are still poorly understood. One aspect that still requires further insights is how the biomolecular corona interacts with and is \u201cread\u201d by the cellular machinery. Within this context, this review is focused on the current understanding of the interactions of the biomolecular corona with cell receptors. First, we address the importance and the role of receptors in the uptake of nanoparticles. Second, we discuss the recent advances and techniques in characterizing and identifying biomolecular corona-receptor interactions. Additionally, we present how we can exploit the knowledge of corona-cell receptor interactions to discover novel receptors for targeting of nanocarriers. Finally, we conclude this review with an outlook on possible future perspectives in the field. A better understanding of the first interactions of nanomaterials with cells, and -in particular -the receptors interacting with the biomolecular corona and involved in nanoparticle uptake, will help for the successful design of nanomedicines for targeted delivery.",

For example, in the case of DNAlipid nanoparticles, vitronectin enriched on particles associates with \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrins on cancer cells [22]. Analogously, for targeting to hepatocytes, interaction with apolipoproteins is required for some siRNA lipoplexes [23,24]. Remarkably, the liver tropism of the first siRNA drug, Onpattro, is based on the ability of lipid nanoparticles to recruit into its PC apolipoprotein E that enables specific hepatocyte targeting [11,25,26]. Recently, the preformed protein corona was harnessed to convert nanoparticles targetable to tumour cells. For that, particles were coated with tumour-specific antibodies and human serum albumin that helps to prevent phagocytosis of the particles [27][28][29].\n\nOn the other hand, protein corona can interfere with targeted delivery by masking the ligand on the nanoparticle surface that specifically interacts with endocytosis triggering receptors [30,31]. The composition and properties of forming protein corona highly depend on one hand on the type and properties of nanoparticles, like composition, size, charge, hydrophobicity etc., [10,[32][33][34][35] and on the other, on environmental factors, like temperature, [36,37] incubation time [17,38] and, especially, on the biofluid type, [39][40][41] origin and disease [42,43]. In general, protein corona on the smaller nanoparticles is thinner and less dense than on the larger ones [44,45].

Active targeting, while more specific and efficient, involves higher costs and potential immunogenicity risks. Targeted LNPs, therefore, represent a promising avenue in mRNA delivery, with future research needed to optimize both passive and active strategies to enhance LNP performance and safety in mRNA and drug delivery.",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

            "text": "For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used. The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

            "text": "Non-specific interactions between nanoparticles and plasma proteins occur when the nanoparticles enter the blood. As a result, coating the original nanoparticles with a protein corona alters the in vivo fate of nanoparticles as well as the biological responses to the nanoparticles. This is one of the substantial reasons for the two main problems associated with nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, i.e., nanotoxicity and the rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the blood after intravenous injection. A preformed albumin corona has been shown to inhibit plasma proteins such as IgG adsorption, decrease complement activation, reduce the macrophage-related phagocytosis, and ultimately prolong the blood circulation time and reduce the toxicity of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, nanoparticle-albumin complexes show an enhanced bioavailability compared to naked nanoparticles [34].\n\nLiposomes are plagued by rapid opsonization, leading to the shortening of their circulation time in the bloodstream. Interactions between liposomes and plasma proteins have been investigated in order to evaluate the role of liposomal lipid composition and concentration in forming the protein corona. Protein corona formation depends on the presence of PEG, cholesterol, the concentration of the components, and surface charge. Liposomes incorporating 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids and cholesterol both in a molar ratio of 11% were reported to be stable over time, while their size was not altered dramatically in a biological medium. Liposomes containing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. Lipid composition and concentration have an effect on the adsorption of proteins and on liposomal stabilization [35].\n\nThe encapsulation of curcumin in a liposome improves its bioavailability and stability, but the short half-life remains an issue. Albumin was used to coat the liposomal curcumin to produce a long-circulating delivery system. Albumin-coated liposomal curcumin particles were more spherical, more homogeneous in size, and significantly larger than liposomal curc",

And last but not the least, incorporation of imaging agents, together with the drug, offers the option of a theranostic approach, that is, it opens opportunities for treatment and target imaging at the same time [61\u2022].\n\nHowever, a key problem for many types of nanoparticles is the formation of a corona [62]. Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

            "text": "While the above approaches allow to more accurately identify which corona components play a role in nanoparticle uptake, the next important aspect to unravel is which cell receptors are involved (Figure 2C). Thus, following the identification of all possible interacting receptors based on corona composition and/or epitope mapping, it is important to verify which of them can actually recognize and bind to the corona and if such recognition and the interaction with those receptors also lead to nanoparticle internalization. For instance, Caracciolo et al. (2013) showed that abundant adsorption of vitronectin from human plasma on lipid nanoparticles promoted nanoparticle uptake into cancer cells overexpressing integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in the uptake. Epitope mapping can also be used to predict the involvement of certain receptors. In the study by Lara et al. (2017) discussed above, epitope mapping showed exposure of apolipoprotein B-100 and the Fc region of IgG in the biomolecular corona of 100 nm silica (Figures 4A,B). Then, the authors also showed that in cells overexpressing their receptors, i.e., the LDL receptor and Fc-gamma receptor I, respectively, nanoparticle uptake was enhanced (see Figures 4C,D for LDL receptor), while adding LDL reduced it (Figure 4E). These results suggested that nanoparticle uptake was mediated by recognition of the biomolecular corona by these specific receptors. These studies also showed that the biomolecular corona can be recognized by multiple receptors in the same cells. Interactions with multiple receptors may lead to uptake via multiple pathways. In line with this, Francia et al. (2019) showed that 50 nm SiO 2 nanoparticles coated with a different corona (in low or high amounts of human serum) interacted with different receptors and consecutively were internalized by cells using different pathways. Thus, the interaction of the corona with specific cell receptors can also affect the mechanisms cells use for nanoparticle internalization. \n\nGiven the wide variety of proteins constituting the biomolecular corona, it has also emerged that more complex motifs can be formed in this layer.",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

The most tightly NP-bound proteins form the so-called hard corona (HC), the key bio-entity that determines the NP's biological identity and physiological response. To date, NP-HC has been almost exclusively characterized in vitro, while NP\u2013protein interactions under realistic in vivo conditions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we thoroughly characterized the in vivo HC of a NP formulation that forms around lipid nanoparticles with a lipid composition equal to that of clinically used liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\u00ae) after the recovery of the NPs from the blood circulation of FVB/N mice 10 minutes post intravenous administration. In vitro HC formed by 10 minutes incubation of NPs in FVB/N mouse plasma was used for comparison. Here we show that the biological identity (i.e. size, zeta-potential and aggregation state) of NPs in vivo is significantly different from that acquired in vitro. Furthermore, the variety of protein species in the in vivo HC was considerably larger. The present work has demonstrated that characterization of the in vivo HC is essential to provide an accurate molecular description of the biological identity of NPs in physiological environments.",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

Because surfactant lipids are obviously highly relevant to bio-nano interactions in the lungs, we therefore suggest an expansion of the protein corona theory to include lipids as another essential factor influencing the pulmonary corona. Its detailed characterization is an indispensable issue to address in future investigations. We believe that these findings are of general importance with respect to pulmonary drug delivery and inhalation toxicology. On the one hand, such assimilation might question the hitherto pursued targeting strategies using nanoparticles because surface-ligands meant for cellular recognition could be masked by pulmonary surfactant components and therefore inactivated. On the other hand, the interplay of the surfactant proteins and lipids as a trigger for AM clearance creates a highly effective biological barrier, protecting the human body against potential noxious effects from any kind of inhaled nanomaterials or pathogens.",

            "text": "Due to their unique mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electronic properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted a lot of attention in the field of nanotechnology. Most interestingly, the potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of CNTs in medicine are being increasingly explored [1][2][3][4][5][6]. It is well known that nanoparticles are rapidly coated with various proteins in biological fluids (such as blood, plasma, or interstitial fluid) to form a protein corona [7,8]. Upon formation, the nanoparticle-protein corona complex, rather than the pristine nanoparticles per se, functions as the biological entity further interacting with other components inside cells or living organisms, which potentially influence the downstream biological events. \n\nRecent studies have identified various proteins that can be adsorbed to different nanoparticles to form the protein corona. Among these, bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been commonly adopted as a model protein to study the formation of protein corona on nanoparticles, including carbon-based nanoparticles [9][10][11][12], metal nanoparticles such as gold [13][14][15], aluminum nanoparticles [16], and zinc oxide nanoparticles [17,18]. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between nanoparticles and proteins and subsequent biological responses are still poorly understood. \n\nThe formation of a protein corona is hypothesized to highly depend on surface properties of nanoparticles. As for CNTs, surface functionalization has been developed to improve their dispersion, stability, and biocompatibility by introducing carboxylic groups or other oxygen-containing groups [19,20]. Carboxylated CNTs can further conjugate covalently with various functional molecules such as drugs, proteins, and oligonucleotides. For example, both singlewalled CNTs (SWCNTs) and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) were functionalized using microwave-assisted acid treatment to induce carboxylation [21,22] and were found to bind more proteins than pristine CNTs in simulated cell culture conditions [23].",

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP) size represents a critical parameter defining the blood circulation, biodistribution, tumor accumulation, and cellular uptake of NADS.Notably, NPs size profoundly influences their fate in vivo.For example, small NPs (< 5 nm) are extremely easy to pass through the renal filtration membrane and are eliminated by the kidney, whereas NPs greater than 10 nm can be enriched with tumors through EPR effects.Furthermore, NPs within the size range of 50-200 nm exhibit a propensity for spleen accumulation, likely due to \"protein coronas\" formed by proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NPs (Figure 3) [25].Particle size is a key physicochemical property of NADS that directly affects the contact area of NADS interaction with blood components, thereby influencing protein corona formation and blood circulation time of NADS [26].In general, the protein adsorption of NPs is size-dependent, especially for lipid-based vectors.Larger NPs with a larger volume tend to adsorb more proteins, resulting in greater protein coverage, while smaller NPs exhibit reduced interactions with blood proteins due to their higher surface curvature [27].For instance, Cui et al. [28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

Additionally, NPs may aggregate to sizes large enough to induce frustrated phagocytosis resulting in chronic inflammation and consequent risk of promoting cancer or neurodegeneration. 55 Nanoparticle Protein Corona. Usually, proteins present in biological media play the role of stabilizing agent by forming a protective protein corona on the surface of the NPs as soon as they come into contact with serum, thus preventing aggregation. 50,56 However, under certain conditions, this is not enough to prevent aggregation, for example, when working with high concentration of NPs in cell culture media or animal models (>10 12 NC/mL). 57 Nanoparticles, in general, strongly interact with macromolecules, a special case being interactions with proteins, their equivalent-sized biological counterparts. The interaction of NPs with proteins and other molecules may alter the metabolism of biological molecules, and the conjugates can be detected by the immune system, evoking a pro-inflammatory response. The protein corona also influences the interactions of NPs with the cell membrane. 58 Adsorption of proteins also modifies the surface charge 50 of the NP and therefore determines how it interacts with biological processes. 59,60 In addition, once the protein corona is formed, opsonins and proteins of the complementary system may be able to recognize proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NP which would trigger an immune response. 61,62 Additionally, conformational changes due to adsorption of proteins on the particle surface may cause lack of recognition by the organisms or may cause autoimmunity. 63 Adsorbed proteins may also influence signaling, when extracellular proteins internalize into cells carried by NPs or when binding of NPs to cells changes structure or association patterns of self-proteins. 64 The interaction of proteins with NPs may modify protein activity and structure and interfere with their natural fate. Therefore, the effect of different corona compositions on intracellular detection mechanisms needs to be investigated. In some cases, the adsorbed proteins can induce signaling by exposing new epitopes upon binding to the NP surface, 65 thus interacting with specific receptors on the cell membrane, such as receptors involved in lipoprotein trafficking, complement receptors, and pattern recognition receptors as the toll-like receptor family. 66",

            "text": "Proteins constitute the majority of bonded biomolecules on the outer layer of nanoparticles in a serum-containing medium, but recently, traces of lipids have also been discovered [84]. Both protein-nanoparticle adsorption affinities and protein-protein interactions influence the binding of proteins on the outer layer of nanoparticles. Proteins with a hard corona are composed of firmly attached proteins that are difficult to detach, whereas proteins with a soft corona are composed of lightly adsorbed proteins. Moreover, soft and hard coronas can be distinguished based on their interchange times. Hard coronas exhibit substantially longer exchange durations, ranging from several hours to many days [26]. According to one theory, proteins in the hard corona completely connect with the surface of the nanomaterial, whereas protein-protein interactions occur at the interface between Blood flow is another important physical element that must be considered. Blood moves at a constant rate, ranging from 0.085 cm.s \u22121 in capillaries to 10 cm.s \u22121 in arteries, and a maximum of 60 cm.s \u22121 inside the aorta. Protein binding generally strengthens with increasing blood flow. However, the exact underlying cause is unknown, and it is speculated that the enhanced protein-blood interactions result from increased interactions between biological molecules and the nanostructures. Additionally, rapid flow rates induce shear stress on the outer layer of nanostructures, preventing the easy deposition of proteins and making it easier for them to connect with others that possess stronger affinity. For example, this might lead to the enrichment of proteins on the nanoparticles, such as plasminogen and other proteins. Similarly, blood flow could alter the conformational shape of unbound proteins, such as plasminogen or the von Willebrand factor (a protein that alleviates the dormant factor VIII blood-clotting protein). \n\nDiverse conformations can lead to variable interactions with nanosystems, and consequently, different protein corona compositions [82]. Furthermore, illnesses can alter the protein corona of a nanosystem. Researchers have investigated the effect of protein shortages on the remodeling of the protein corona on PS nanoparticles due to common illnesses and medical situations [83].",

            "text": "LNPs are challenging to process experimentally because they have physical characteristics similar to endogenous particles in the blood and other biofluids. Size, chemical composition, density, spectral characteristics etc., all overlap with endogenous nanoparticles that are also usually much more numerous, and this complicates the analysis. Assay design also has to accommodate throughput, cost and, feasibility. \n\nIn the context of our work, we have used therapeutic LNPs containing fluorescent mRNA cargoes to ensure that we are retrieving not just PEG molecules, but also the LNP cargo as well. Using proteomics, we can detect large numbers of proteins, but markers for EVs are notably absent. Furthermore, we see different types of coronas with different LNP compositions, rather than simply pulling down the same serum components consistently as it would be in the case of systematic contamination in the isolation procedure. Finally, the composition of the quantified LNP coronas is different from the parent plasmas. One would assume that if PEGylated lipids were simply transferring to plasma components, then there would be no particular specificity and one should obtain a proteomic pattern containing components from all lipid-related endogenous particles, and this is not what we observe. \n\nWe appreciate Simsonsen's careful evaluation of our work and, we will incorporate more extensive AF4 particle characterization in future experiments. As discussed above, notwithstanding the physiological and chemical similarities among lipoproteins, EVs, and LNPs, significant distinctions persist in their physiochemical properties, origin, formation mechanisms, compositions and, subpopulation heterogeneity. Hence, the adoption of isolation methods previously tailored for disparate nanosized entities necessitates meticulous validation to prevent cross-contaminations and enhance both efficacy and throughput. Finally, with concerns addressed, our opinion is that none of the points raised by Dr. Simonsen alter our conclusions. \n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.",

            "text": "Further, they correlated the relative teemingness of known proteins in the PC with the positive or negative impact of NPs on cellular uptake in cancer and stem cells to discriminate the key corona component. Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

            "text": "Pharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "text": "For instances, protein C had more interaction with thiolated PEC, serotransferin mostly absorbed on the PEC with additional Ch content, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor interaction associated to the PEC structure which interacted with the PECs with D/Ch ratio of 5 rather than D/Ch ratio of 0.2. The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties. Although albumin has the most percentage in serum, we assume that the mentioned proteins have more affinity to the PEC functional groups. \n\nMoreover, the interaction of the specific proteins can affect the biodistribution, clearance, and uptake of the nanoparticles by macrophages and target cells 49,50 .",

            "title": "Effect of PEG Anchor and Serum on Lipid Nanoparticles: Development of a Nanoparticles Tracking Method",
            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

Even in the case of viruses, the known composition of certain virions facilitates identification of corona proteins derived from the mammalian host. The difficulty of EV corona analysis is that both the corona and the EV proteins are derived from the same host organism. In addition, EVs are heterogeneous, therefore identifying which molecules belong to the protein corona and which are components of EVs proves to be challenging. Although the protein composition of separated plasma EVs has been already compared with published proteomic datasets of both EV preparations and artificial nanoparticle coronas, and based on this, the existence of a protein corona around EVs has already been proposed (Palviainen et al., 2020), no direct experimental evidence has been provided so far about the formation of an EV protein corona.\n\nHere we used the approach to harvest nascent EVs from serum-free conditioned medium of THP1 cells and Optiprep-purified platelets and to incubate these vesicles in EVDP samples. Our MS results obtained after dC, SEC or DGUC provided evidence for the presence of EV-associated proteins. The corona was also detectable by Wes, confocal microscopy, transmission and immune EM and was also reflected by an increased floatation density of 'coated EVs' . Some of the corona proteins could be dissociated from the EV surface in the presence of high salt solution suggesting electrostatic interactions in the corona formation.\n\nWe next compared published datasets of protein coronas formed in human blood plasma around viruses (such as HSV and RSV) and lipid nanoparticles (of the size of approx. 200 nm) with our THP1 and platelet EV data. One of the most exciting results of this study was that we found nine proteins that were present in all six datasets (THP1 and platelet mEVs, HSV, RSV, positively and negatively charged lipid nanoparticles). Furthermore, these nine proteins were also detected in several other previous studies on artificial nanoparticles (Br\u00fcckner et al., 2020;Di Santo et al., 2020;Digiacomo et al., 2020;Giulimondi et al., 2019;Papafilippou et al., 2020;",

The adsorption of proteins to nanoparticle surface establish a protein corona has been given particular attention in the recent years, particularly within the context of nanomedicine targeting. Since many proteins are amphipathic, they have the potential to interact with almost any nanoparticle surface in their vicinity. Consequently, the interfacial interactions of nanoparticles with proteins are inevitable in such environments. In concordance, as expressed thermodynamically by D ads G < 0 (where D ads G symbolises the Gibbs free energy of adsorption), this mechanism of lowering the excess surface energy of nanoparticles is spontaneous. 40 The surface adsorption of serum proteins by particles (opsonisation) was \ue103rst postulated by Wright and Douglas in 1903. 41 Later in 1962, whilst assessing the surface adsorption of \ue103brinogen in blood plasma, Vroman noticed that the maximum surface concentration of \ue103brinogen was attained at an intermediate time point, suggestive of its substitution by other proteins with time. 42 Described by the Vroman effect, corona formation is a dynamic and competitive process. The initial stages of adsorption are dominated by small (high mobility), abundant proteins. However, with time, some of these proteins are substituted by those which are larger (low mobility), less abundant and have greater affinity for the surface. 43 An equilibrium is gradually attained, a\ue09der which each protein has equal rates of association and dissociation, and further exchange causes no change in the corona's composition. 44 As illustrated in Fig. 2, the protein corona branches into a 'hard corona' and 'so\ue09d corona'; these denote a \ue103rmly bound, equilibrium state layer (wherein proteins exhibit high affinity for the nanoparticle surface), and a loosely bound layer (comprised of low-affinity proteins in rapid exchange with those in the medium), respectively. 45,46 An intrinsic in\ue104uencer of protein corona composition is nanoparticle size.

Here, we show that spiking small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on otherwise identical NPs, significantly enhancing the depth of plasma proteome profiling. The protein coronas on polystyrene NPs when exposed to plasma treated with an array of small molecules allows for the detection of 1793 proteins marking an 8.25-fold increase in the number of quantified proteins compared to plasma alone (218 proteins) and a 2.63-fold increase relative to the untreated protein corona (681 proteins). Furthermore, we discovered that adding 1000\u2009\u00b5g/ml phosphatidylcholine could singularly enable the detection of 897 proteins. At this specific concentration, phosphatidylcholine selectively depletes the four most abundant plasma proteins, including albumin, thus reducing the dynamic range of plasma proteome and enabling the detection of proteins with lower abundance. Employing an optimized data-independent acquisition approach, the inclusion of phosphatidylcholine leads to the detection of 1436 proteins in a single plasma sample. Our molecular dynamics results reveal that phosphatidylcholine interacts with albumin via hydrophobic interactions, H-bonds, and water bridges. The addition of phosphatidylcholine also enables the detection of 337 additional proteoforms compared to untreated protein corona using a top-down proteomics approach.

However, incubation of NF55-SCO nanoparticles in murine serum for 60 min resulted in a significantly higher amount of C3 proteins in the corona compared to SCO alone. That may be caused by higher hydrophobicity of NF55 [81] or its complexes with SCO compared to PF14, and higher absorption of proteins, including C3, [87] on hydrophobic NPs [88]. In case of murine plasma, however, no significant differences were observed between any nanoparticles tested and the amount of C3 proteins adsorbed to nanoparticles was rather equal (Figure 4c  or SCO alone were bound to streptavidin on superparamagnetic beads or beads were left untreated (control) before incubation with murine serum (a,b) or murine plasma (c,d) for 5 or 60 min at room temperature. After pull-down, bound C3 and its fragments were quantified by Western blot.

Here we show that in bloodstream, CPP-NA nanoparticles acquire a novel nano-biomolecular interface and recruit into protein corona anti-opsonising proteins like serum albumin, clusterin and apolipoproteins at a higher extent compared to only nucleic acids-containing particles. Moreover, CPPs reduce inclusion of C3 protein in protein corona on pDNA particles and thereby might prolong circulation of respective nanoparticles in organism before elimination (Figure 3c,d) [83,84].",

In a comprehensive study using a panel of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes and surface modifications, Tenzer et al. 26 could show that plasma protein adsorption occurs very rapidly, and that it affects hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, cellular uptake, and endothelial cell death. Vlasova et al. 27 reported that adsorbed plasma proteins influenced neutrophil responses caused by polymer-coated, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Specifically, the adsorption of IgG resulted in neutrophil activation, as determined by degranulation and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Similarly, protein adsorption modulated neutrophil responses toward carboxylated, non-PEGylated SWCNTs 28 . Lara et al. 29 employed an immuno-mapping technique to study epitope presentation of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immunoglobulin G. The authors could show that both proteins displayed functional motifs allowing for recognition of the bio-corona on silica nanoparticles by LDL receptor and Fc-\u03b3 receptor I, respectively. On the other hand, others have pointed out that the bio-corona could shield targeting ligands on nanoparticles 30 .

            "text": "Findings from screening indicated that LNPs containing ionizable lipids with distinct bonds in their tails, O-series (ester bonds) versus N-series (amide bonds) lipids shifted the delivery from liver to lung.Analysis of the protein corona composition revealed that N-series LNPs were enriched in vitronectin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and proteins that are known to bind the vitronectin receptor  v  3, [81] possibly accounting for their lung tropism.Conversely, the O-series LNPs' corona exhibited a high ApoE enrichment, a fact that might explain their liver tropism. [82]This study underscores the impact of seemingly minor changes in the lipids' chemical features on corona constituents.\n\nThe mentioned SORT approach has demonstrated its applicability beyond lung targeting, as on a similar note the incorporation of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidic acid into LNPs was reported to promote the attachment of  2glycoprotein I.As a result, specific delivery to the spleen was achieved. [77]The interaction between  2 -glycoprotein I and acidic phospholipids has been described previously, reinforcing the rational incorporation of these lipids into NPs to specifically attract serum proteins facilitating spleen targeting. [83]ome authors have argued that it is possible to extend the circulation time of PEGylated liposomes through their conjugation with an albumin-binding domain (ABD).This led to eightfold enrichment in albumin content within the corona, contributing to increased tumor accumulation. [84,85]Similarly, arginine-lipid based siRNA polyplexes, which exhibited notable albumin association on their surface, were also associated with prolonged circulation times. [86]he examination of the concepts around endogenous targeting necessitates cautious assessment in terms of their translatability, given the multifaceted factors contributing to specific protein corona formation.Among these, hydrophobicity, surface chemistry, and charge do not depend only on NP components but on their structural arrangement.

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

            "text": "Therefore, an enormous effort is put in investigating the processes mediating nanoparticle interaction with body fluids and cells. Various literature describes that after intravenous injection nanoparticles rapidly interact with diverse blood components like immunoglobulins, bloodclotting factors, and complement proteins, forming a socalled protein corona [27,[55][56][57][58][59][60][61]. The so built corona can be subdivided in a hard corona formed by proteins with strong binding affinity to the nanoparticles' surface like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins and the soft corona, which builds the outer layer of the corona, and is dominated by weakly bound proteins for example albumin [59,60,62,63]. The whole process is also referred to as opsonization that only then enables recognition by and interaction with phagocytic cells [26,27,55,64]. Probably this is exactly what happened to the nanoparticles used in this study and explains the rapid accumulation in liver and spleen. However, the significantly higher uptake of the nanoparticles at the magnetic implant is a clear proof-of-concept, and with a much longer circulation time one can assume a further increasing accumulation. \n\nBy implementing a range of methods like size-exclusion chromatography gel filtration, isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance studies, Cedervall et al. gained a deeper understanding of the nanoparticle protein interaction [65]. They found that protein adsorption is strongly dependent on the particle surface characteristics and size but on protein identity as well. Especially, surface hydrophobicity plays a major role [65]. A more recent study investigated the protein adsorption on different types of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) using 10% and 100% fetal calf serum (FCS) focusing on the hard corona [66]. The most important finding of this study was that surface functionality, particle type, pore size, surface roughness and incubation time had a lesser influence on the extent of protein adsorption to the particles than the serum concentration.",

Both protein-nanoparticle adsorption affinities and protein-protein interactions influence the binding of proteins on the outer layer of nanoparticles. Proteins with a hard corona are composed of firmly attached proteins that are difficult to detach, whereas proteins with a soft corona are composed of lightly adsorbed proteins. Moreover, soft and hard coronas can be distinguished based on their interchange times. Hard coronas exhibit substantially longer exchange durations, ranging from several hours to many days [26]. According to one theory, proteins in the hard corona completely connect with the surface of the nanomaterial, whereas protein-protein interactions occur at the interface between the soft and hard coronas. Even at the minimum concentration of biomolecules, the corona layer provides total surface coverage. By contrast, the adsorbed corona does not entirely obscure the outer layer of nanoparticles [82]. \n\nThe thickness of the protein corona can be influenced by several factors, including protein content, particle size, and particle surface characteristics. Proteins in plasma have hydrodynamic sizes ranging from 2 to 20 nm, and the formed protein layer is extremely thick, comprising multiple layers of linked proteins rather than just one. Simberg et al. introduced the concept of the protein corona [85]. According to this concept, the protein corona contains \"primary binders\" that directly recognize the outer layer of nanoparticles and \"secondary binders\" that interact with the primary binders through protein-protein interactions. The secondary binders may modify the activity of the primary binders or \"cover\" them, thus inhibiting their contact, which is crucial for the physiological response [86]. \n\nWalkey and Chan reviewed a group of plasma proteins called adsorbomes that are commonly found in the protein coronas of nanomaterials [87]. This list is expected to grow in the future with increasing research on the topic. Based on nearly 20 years of research, a \"normal\" plasma protein corona consists of approximately 2-6 proteins that are bound abundantly, along with numerous additional proteins that are bound with lower abundances.",

Previously, a method of soft corona fixation using click chemistry was proposed [10], which requires separate modification of hard corona and serum proteins. Our approach involves PACL modification of only serum proteins, which are then sorbed onto the surface of MLNCs, form hard and soft coronas, and are fixed to the surface under UV irradiation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the serum components carried one or two modifications. After incubation of MLNCs in modified serum and UV irradiation under chosen conditions, particles bearing a full corona were isolated. MLNCs were visualized using TEM at each stage of this study. The formation of a HC did not change the structure of MLNC/HCs compared to MLNCs, while the full corona was clearly visualized. A full corona under the selected conditions and with a photomodifier does not completely cover the surface of the particles but forms aggregates with linear dimensions comparable to the particle sizes. Apparently, such sorption of corona proteins is due to the heterogeneity of the lipid-peptide membrane, which may be caused by clustering of its components.",

            "text": "For long-distance information transport, exosomes and microvesicles are of interest as vehicles. Exosomes are derived from endosomal compartments named multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whereas microvesicles directly bud from plasma membranes (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2018(Th\u00e9ry et al., , 2002)). During long-distance transport, EVs encounter biological fluids, such as blood, and proteins likely adsorb to their surface. This is referred to as protein corona formation. The adsorbed protein corona can ultimately alter the EV functionality as observed for many nanoparticles. This has been largely neglected in the field of EV research. The formation of an EV protein corona was first described by T\u00f3th et al. who revealed the protein composition as well as demonstrated the influence of a protein corona on EV functionality (T\u00f3th et al., 2021). Shortly after, this was confirmed by Wolf et al. who demonstrated that a protein corona is necessary for EVs to reach their full potential in angiogenesis and wound healing assays (Wolf et al., 2022). These findings started a paradigm shift from viewing plasma-derived proteins as contaminants of EV preparations towards considering them as additional EV components. \n\nPresumably, the insights into the protein corona formed on nanoparticles also will benefit the functional understanding of the EV corona. Nanoparticles quickly adsorb proteins upon contact with biological fluids. This changes their chemical identity to a biological identity and ultimately alters their biodistribution and cell uptake (Walczyk et al., 2010). Distinct proteins regulate the uptake of nanoparticles. Apolipoproteins, a class of lipid-binding proteins abundant in human blood, are known to promote a prolonged blood circulation time by avoiding uptake in phagocytic monocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Gustafson et al., 2015). This has also been referred to as stealth effect. In contrast, so-called opsonins, such as immunoglobulins mark nanoparticles for uptake in phagocytes (Yang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "There is currently growing interest in how nanoparticles (NPs) interact with living systems, both from the point of view of the safe implementation of nanotechnology, [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] as well as from an improved drug delivery perspective. 8,9 4][25] Consequently, it becomes interesting to correlate NP uptake not to properties of the bare NP, but to properties of the NP-biomolecular corona complex. 26,27  uptake begins with an initial adhesion of the NP to the cell and interactions with the lipids, proteins and other components of the cell membrane. This is followed by the activation of an energy-dependent uptake mechanism, 10,11,14 which allows the NPs to be internalised into the cell and further trafficked to different subcellular locations, typically ending in lysosomal accumulation. 10,28,29 One of the key steps in NP uptake efficiency is therefore the starting NP adhesion to the cell membrane. Previous studies have investigated this aspect, for example by exposing cells to NPs at 4 \u00b0C to inhibit internalisation [30][31][32] , or by dissolving NPs on the outside of the membrane. 15 Information on NP adhesion to membranes composed solely of lipids is also emerging by studying their adsorption onto micron-sized particles coated with lipids. 33 In this work we have investigated the adhesion properties of NPs with a particular emphasis on the effect of the biomolecular corona. Interactions between biomolecules in the corona and corresponding receptors in the cell membrane may trigger biological recognition and uptake of the NP-corona complex. It has, furthermore, been shown that corona biomolecules can interact with membrane receptors to induce cell-signaling response. 34 In both cases, the response is due to a specific interaction between corona biomolecules and components of the cell membrane. However, it is important not to disregard unspecific interactions and the adhesion properties they lead to. Thus NPs with high energy of the bare surface typically adsorb strongly to cell membranes because of unspecific interactions, thereby lowering their surface energy.",

            "text": "The impact of protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles (NPs) with cells remains an open question. This question is particularly relevant to NPs which sizes, ranging from tens to hundreds nanometers, are comparable to the sizes of most abundant proteins in plasma. Protein sizes match with typical thickness of various coatings and ligands layers, usually present at the surfaces of larger NPs. Such size match may affect the properties and the designed function of NPs. We offer a direct demonstration of how protein corona can dramatically change the interaction mode between NPs and lipid bilayers. To this end, we choose the most extreme case of NP surface modification: nanostructures in the form of rigid spikes of 10-20 nm length at the surface of gold nanoparticles. In the absence of proteins we observe the formation of reversible pores when spiky NPs absorb on lipid bilayers. In contrast, the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins adsorbed at the surface of spiked NPs, effectively reduce the length of spikes exposed to the interaction with lipid bilayers. Thus, protein corona changes qualitatively the dynamics of pore formation, which is completely suppressed at high protein concentrations. These results suggest that protein corona can not only be critical for interaction of NPs with membranes, it may change their mode of interaction, thus offsetting the role of surface chemistry and ligands.",

            "text": "The interactions between nanosized particles and living systems are commonly mediated by what adsorbs to the nanoparticle in the biological environment, its biomolecular corona, rather than the pristine surface. Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by the presence or absence of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the bare material. Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific interactions between the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the bare material and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake. We suggest that future nanoparticle-cell studies include, together with characterization of size, charge, and dispersion stability, an evaluation of the adhesion properties of the material to relevant membranes.",

Adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins is an inevitable process that takes place instantaneously upon contact with physiological fluid (e.g. blood). Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of",

            "text": "We have developed a new type of magnetic LNP as a model for using MS to study the BMC of LNPs. We have established an experimental workflow that is highly versatile for the isolation of an intact LNP with the adsorbed protein corona as shown in Scheme 1. \n\nCommon BMC separation techniques such as centrifugation have previously been implemented for identifying enriched proteins adsorbed on the surface of LNPs (21,22), however, the harsh separation process required likely affected the LNP integrity during pellet formation and may not effectively remove unbounded proteins (35). This MS method offers distinct advantages over conventional methods, such as the ability to use LNP formulation containing the same molar ratio and lipid composition as clinically relevant formulations while recovering isolated intact LNP-corona samples with lower amounts of unwanted free proteins. However, like most LNP-corona separation techniques, there are also limitations to the MS method. The IONP encapsulation process will need to be reoptimized for formulations containing different molar ratios of the ionizable lipid as the separation efficiency is expected to be positively correlated with the amount of ionizable lipid present. For example, lowering the ionizable lipid content in LNP formulations will likely lower the number of IONPs/LNP as there will be fewer protonated ionizable lipid molecules to complex with the negatively charged IONPs when formulating at low pH. However, because the MS method relies on material encapsulated in the core of the LNP, rather than isolation methods that depend on changing the surface properties, we suggest that the protein profiles observed are more representative of the actual BMC experienced in vivo. LNP technology is a state-of-the-art approach that is paving the way for the widespread use of LNP-based gene therapeutics including the COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (36). It is well established that the BMC can dramatically affect the tropism of LNPs as illustrated by the influence of adsorbed apo-E on uptake of Onpattro LNP into hepatocytes (4).",

            "text": "After entering the biological system, nanoparticles interact with the biomolecules in the body and will give rise to a layer called the \"corona\". This happens within seconds of nanoparticle exposure by a process called the Vroman effect. This layer consists of many biomolecules with increased adsorption and enhanced properties compared to those in the normal biological environment. Thus, this has a high impact on the ultimate performance of these nanoparticles. The liquid profile and protein composition of this corona layer have been extensively studied with respect to various works. According to the adsorption rate of proteins to their surface, the corona can be classified into two main categories: a hard corona and a soft corona. High affinity proteins tightly and directly associated with nanoparticles will form a hard corona, and low affinity proteins loosely and indirectly associated with nanoparticles will form a soft corona. While taking this into consideration, a hard corona is more convenient in terms of nanotechnology. The structure and composition of the corona layer can be studied by various techniques, such as DLS, SEC, DCS, TEM, PAGE, LC-MS/MS, DC, SPR, ITC, etc. Parameters like the number of bonds, thermodynamic feasibility of interaction, rearrangements of molecules, temperature, conformational changes, solvation, influence of other proteins, etc., determine the nanomaterial\u2212 protein adsorption effect. 11 Generally, there are 3 steps in the protein adsorption to nanoparticles, especially for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (Figure :2): \n\n\u2022 Region 1: characterized by protein\u2212NP surface interaction only with original protein conformation. \n\n\u2022 Region 2: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions and protein\u2212NP interactions with changes in its structural conformations. \n\n\u2022 Region 3: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions only, along with structural alterations and protein multilayer formation. \n\nThe composition of the corona is formed by different types of plasma proteins, viz., immunoglobulins, tissue leakage proteins, complement factors, coagulants, lipoproteins, and other serum components. They are collectively called \"adsorbomes\" after the adsorption mechanism.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "Next, we examined the effect of DOPE-C8 on the biodistribution of LNPs. The blood half-life of the DOPE-C8-LNPs was clearly less than 10 min (Figure S1, Supporting Information); therefore, the biodistribution of the LNPs 1 h after intravenous injection was examined using IVIS (Figure 2D). The DOPE-Cx showed a significantly higher level of accumulation in the kidney compared with that when using DSPC, albeit at lower values. No differences between LNPs were observed for other organs. The highest accumulation was in the liver, which was followed by slight accumulations in the spleen and lungs. Intrahepatic distribution of the LNPs revealed that consistent levels of all LNPs accumulate mainly in hepatocytes, which are located in an area enclosed by blood vessels (Figure 2E). These results suggest that DOPE-C8 has a limited effect on the biodistribution of LNPs and that the improved mRNA expression level derives from intracellular processes such as endosomal escape. \n\nWhen nanoparticles such as LNPs are exposed to proteins such as blood, they form a protein-based layer on their surface, which is referred to as the biomolecular corona. [11] The physicochemical properties of LNPs affect their interactions with proteins and alter the biomolecular corona. The properties of the biomolecular corona are known to alter both the pharmacokinetics and the toxicity of LNPs. [12] Reports also show that phospholipids such as DSPC are preferentially located in the outer layer of LNPs due to their bulky hydrophilic moiety compared with that of other lipidic components such as ionizable lipids and cholesterol. [13] egatively charged phospholipids are known to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and secondary lymphoid organs. [14] e recently reported that the increased surface density of electrostatically neutral DSPC selectively delivers mRNA to the spleen rather than to the liver by abolishing ApoE-dependent hepatic clearance.

            "text": "Nanomaterials adopt a new \"identity\" in the body through the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009). This phenomenon, known as bio-corona formation, is dependent upon intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials including size or surface curvature and surface chemistry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Tenzer et al., 2011) and on the physiological environment (i.e., the extracellular or intracellular milieu). Thus, the biological identity of nanomaterials is context dependent (Nystr\u00f6m & Fadeel, 2012). Importantly, while most publications are focused on the protein corona, one should not ignore other biomolecules including lipids, as lipid-binding proteins are commonly found in the bio-corona of nanoparticles (Hellstrand et al., 2009). \n\nThe environmental dimensions of the protein corona (often referred to as the \"eco-corona\") have been expertly covered (Wheeler et al., 2021) and will not be discussed here. \n\nIn our previous survey of bio-corona research, it was noted that we and others had deployed proteomics approaches to catalogue the proteins present on the surface of a wide range of nanomaterials including spherical particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) or polystyrene (PS) particles and fiber-like materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fadeel et al., 2013). The majority of these studies were carried out using human plasma or fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in many cases, several hundred proteins were identified in the biocorona (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, these results prompt several questions: first, why do so many different proteins congregate on the surface of nanoparticles? Indeed, as previously pointed out, it seems counterintuitive that \"proteins in the blood that evolved not to bind nonspecifically to each other would do so around nanoparticles\" (Lundqvist & Cedervall, 2020).",

Biological media, such as blood plasma, are incredibly complex and contain over 3,700 identified proteins, leading to a highly competitive environment for the formation of the corona. This phenomenon, known as the Vroman effect, highlights the dynamic nature of protein adsorption, where proteins with higher mobility and lower affinity initially occupy the NP surface, only to be replaced by proteins with higher affinity over time. \n\nIn addition to proteins, several other molecules in whole blood can contribute to the formation of the NP corona [36], including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, metabolites, complement factors, and antibodies [62]. For example, lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids, glycans-which are carbohydrate molecules that play a role in cell recognition and signaling-or small metabolites like glucose, hormones, and vitamins can adsorb onto NPs, altering their surface properties and influencing their interactions with cells [61]. \n\nOn the other hand, circulating DNA is present in the blood of all individuals [67], and its concentration increases in cancer patients [28]. Furthermore, depending on the state of different diseases, blood plasma also contains a variety of RNA types, including mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and fragments of rRNAs, snoRNAs, and miRNAs [54,58], suggesting that the NP-corona composition also depends on the health condition of the host. Moreover, complement factors that are part of the immune system and immunoglobulins or antibodies, which are glycoproteins produced by plasma cells, can mark the NP for clearance by immune cells [61]. Therefore, it will be critical in the future to understand how all these components collectively form the biomolecular hard and soft corona, which significantly impacts the biological identity and fate of NPs in the body [62].",

In the absence of biomolecules, on the other hand, the high surface energy of the original nanoparticle surface remains when in contact with cells. Thus, components from the cell membrane instead adsorbs to the nanoparticle -effectively forming a cell-derived corona 80 -and only then is the high surface energy lowered. In essence, it is imperative to expose nanoparticles with corona to blood-brain barrier models, because otherwise effects that will never be seen in vivo may be observed. Corona formation can be ensured simply by using medium supplemented with serum (or, better yet, plasma) in the nanoparticle studies. This may not be the correct corona, because the exposure route will determine which biomolecules can be found in the corona, and ultimately those biomolecules will determine how the nanoparticle is processed by the blood-brain barrier. Nevertheless, while the detailed biomolecules will determine the specifics, it would appear that a far bigger effect results from having biomolecules there at all.",

[65][66][67][68] Effectively what it means is that, the original nanoparticle surface is not seen by the cell membrane, but rather those biomolecules which remain on the nanoparticle surface for long enough. Thus, cell membrane receptors will interact with biomolecules in the corona, and, presumably, this interaction will determine by which mechanism the nanoparticle enters the cell. 69,70 Subsequently, one would hypothesize that once inside, the biomolecules in the corona -if, indeed, the remain associated with the nanoparticle 71-73 -will determine to where the nanoparticle is shuttled, including if it is sent through to the other side of the barrier. This puts the spotlight on identifying which biomolecules are found in the corona, and which remain there for long times. It is noteworthy that the corona composition is not a simple reflection of the biofluid in which the nanoparticle is found. That is, if a nanoparticle is put into blood plasma with serum albumin as its main component, this does not imply that serum albumin is the main component of the nanoparticle corona. 49 Rather, low abundant species are frequently picked up by nanoparticles, and, in general, the corona depends strongly on nanoparticle properties such as surface, 74 size, 61,74 shape 75 and even concentration of the biofluid. 60 Importance in vivo It seems clear that the corona will be a key determinant of how the nanoparticles are processed in vivo. In a sense, this has already been partly demonstrated. Thus, coating nanoparticles by polysorbate 80 results in the adsorption of apolipoproteins to the nanoparticle surface 10,76 -in the language employed here, the formation of a corona which includes apolipoproteins -and this has been related to successful transport of",

            "text": "Using super-resolution optical microscopy (STORM), Feiner-Gracia et al. (2017) were able to visualize the protein corona formed on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity and found a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption within the same nanoparticle population. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that changes in the corona composition occurred over time due to the chemistry and degradability of the particles, thus adding a further level of complexity to our understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials (Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017). \n\nThe second, non-technical (and non-trivial) question refers to the biological \"meaning,\" if any, of all these proteins. It is well understood that the presence or absence of proteins, regardless of their identity, may influence the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles. The question is whether there is a role for specific proteins in the bio-corona? Tenzer et al. (2013) performed comprehensive studies using a panel of PS nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles of various sizes displaying different surface charges and could show that the rapid formation of a plasma protein corona could modulate distinct pathophysiological effects as evidenced by the ex vivo analysis of platelet activation/aggregation and red blood cell lysis (i.e., hemolysis). However, the complexity of the protein corona precluded the assignment of specific proteins to account for these effects (and perhaps the effects were related to a shielding of the particle surface, thereby passivating the nanoparticles) (see, e.g., Hu et al., 2011, Lesniak et al., 2012). Indeed, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles is mitigated in the presence of serum whereas ZnO nanoparticles that undergo rapid dissolution are cytotoxic both in the absence and presence of serum (Shi et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The purpose of our publication \"Multiomics analysis of naturally efficacious lipid nanoparticle coronas reveals high-density lipoprotein is necessary for their function\" 1 was to elucidate why plasma from obese rats seemed to improve the function of therapeutic lipid nanoparticles (LNP), and use this knowledge to suggest how LNPs might be improved. A comprehensive proteomic analysis revealed that there is a correlation between LNP coronal content, from different individual animals and, LNP function in those same individuals. More effective LNPs tended to have coronal proteomic signatures consistent with increased HDL content. We validated this by creating HDL-augmented coronas artificially and found that these do indeed lead to improved LNP function both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we conclude that measuring LNP association with certain coronal elements, notably with the HDL component ApoM, is a good predictor for LNP efficacy. \n\nThe Matters Arising from Simonsen questions whether the pulldown method we proposed \"avoids the co-isolation of lipoproteins and EVs\". We are fully aware of potential lipoprotein and EV contamination in existing LNP corona isolation methods and this was discussed in the original publication 1 . We included multiple controls and validation experiments to ensure that any eventual contaminants do not affect our conclusions. We believe that these efforts contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of LNP coronas and other nanosized particles in complex biological systems. \n\nSeveral techniques are available to isolate LNPs from biofluids. Density centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, flow fractionation and pull-down assays may be used. Unfortunately, most of these are relatively slow, require large sample volumes, produce variable results or, they are difficult to parallelize. Systematic exploration of the relationship between LNP composition, LNP coronal content and biofluids from individual animals requires high throughput and speed, good reproducibility and, compatibility with laboratory automation systems. We found that only the pull-down method met these criteria, allowing us to make the large-scale comparisons necessary to see patterns, and to do this quickly enough that the composition of the fragile, metastable coronas can be preserved.",

            "text": "addition of fetuin into culture medium increased cellular uptake of PF14-SCO nanoparticles and splicing correction by SCO in HeLa pLuc705 cells in SR-dependent manner [52]. Interestingly, in case of human serum, PF14-pDNA nanoparticles demonstrated higher adsorption of most proteins compared to pDNA alone (Table 5), further emphasizing marked differences in composition of protein corona between sera of various mammals. In addition to fetuin, which marks nanoparticles for recognition by macrophages via scavenger receptors, also \u03b1-2-macroglobulin that is abundant in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) might dampen the effect of injected pharmaceuticals, like oligonucleotides, targeting these to elimination as found earlier [77].\n\nTo sum up, serum albumin was a prominent constituent in protein corona forming around CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in all studied sera: from calf, mouse and human, although from mouse serum it did not associate to nanoparticles with the highest yield. However, the protein composition varied extensively between different sera and each protein corona showed individual pattern.\n\nIn addition, the functioning of proteins forming corona around PF14-pDNA nanoparticles in murine serum is in good concordance with the recent reports about the behaviour and targeting [78] of these nanoparticles in vivo. Accordingly, high level of alpha 1antitrypsin in protein corona of PF14-pDNA nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) correlates well with accumulation of nanoparticles in lungs of mice [79]. It was also shown that accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100, [80] and complement component 3 [78] in protein corona targets nanoparticles to liver. In both these organs high expression of luciferase from pGL3 plasmid was observed recently, whereas only low amounts of these nanoparticles were targeted to spleen, kidney, and heart [55,81].",

Thus, controlling the corona composition can possibly provide new ways to control the initial interactions of nano-sized materials with cells. \n\nThe corona composition depends on nanoparticle physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, rigidity and surface characteristics [3,7,8,48,54]. By changing these properties, the corona composition might be tuned to contain components that bind to specific cell surface receptors and initiate internalization [17,49,[55][56][57]. Similarly, artificial coronas can be formed to achieve recognition by specific receptors. For instance, Tonigold and colleagues have shown that pre-adsorbed antibodies, which could be seen as a form of preformed corona, kept, at least partially, their targeting ability in the presence of serum [40]. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the effects of the corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells are being more and more recognized [41,58,59]. For example, multiple attempts have been made in trying to predict how the presence of the corona affects targeting of nanomedicines [60,61].",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic which broke out late in 2019 promoted intensive development, rapid marketing and introduction into clinical practice of highly efficient prophylactic vaccines based on lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and the full-length virus spike protein (S-protein) mRNA produced by Moderna [1,2] and Pfizer/BioNTech [3]. These vaccine constructs are supramolecular systems, specifically, nanoparticles consisting of multiple lipid molecules and mRNA molecule(s) (for example, see the reviews [4,5]). The structural and functional roles of lipid molecules consist in facilitating compact packaging of long-chain nucleic acid molecules, protecting them from degradation by extracellular enzymes, providing for the nanoparticle transport into the cell via endocytosis (phagocytosis or pinocytosis) and subsequent mRNA release from the endosome (phagosome) into the cytoplasm for translation and expression of the immunogenic epitope-containing protein. Presumably, mRNA entry into the cytoplasm is a result of LNP-constituting lipids transition to their cationic form under the acidic conditions in the endosome, which promotes their contact with anionic lipids in the periplasmic monolayer of the endosome membrane and further membrane destabilization due to the formation of nonbilayer lipid structures (hexagonal phase) [6]. Taking into account the diversity of func-tions, the lipid platform of mRNA-containing LNPs should include several classes of lipids. The key component is ionizable lipids, which ensure both mRNA packaging during LNP assembly and mRNA release into the cytoplasm. The structures of ionizable lipids in the vaccines produced by both companies are very close, and the protocols for their synthesis are described in the corresponding patents [7][8][9].",

            "text": "This work exhaustively illustrates all the possible interaction models and how to analyze the experimental data obtained to have a better understanding of the measured phenomena. Concerning the interactions between nanoparticles and blood components, an interesting study reports the QCM-D characterization of the interactions between a lipid bilayer and carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles coated with different kinds of protein corona [20]. The study found that the 'soft' protein corona, composed of loosely bounded proteins, induced a permanent alteration in the lipid bilayer structure, while the 'hard' protein corona, composed of strongly bounded proteins, weakly interacted with a lipid bilayer. However, QCM-D is a very versatile technique with which the interactions of nanoparticles have also been studied with other blood components, such as platelets [21] The study of the protein corona is crucial for the development of safe and effective nanoparticles. The QCM-D technique can provide reliable screening of interactions with protein corona-related blood proteins and has been used in several studies to characterize protein corona formation on polymeric nanoparticles. However, the results obtained from QCM-D measurements should be interpreted in the whole context of the specific system under investigation, and other techniques should be used in conjunction with QCM-D to provide a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. \n\nIn the present work, the QCM-D technique is applied to a rough evaluation of the protein corona formation around poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles. The QCM-D sensors were functionalized with three different blood proteins, namely albumin from human serum (HSA), fibrinogen type I from human plasma (HPF), and \u03b3-globulins from human blood (HBG), and the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the functionalization layers was evaluated. Three nanoparticles with different protein affinities were tested, and the system was validated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis experiments. This research provides a valid method to characterize the interactions between tested nanoparticles and three blood proteins commonly abundant in the protein corona.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

Although nanostructures have been present in human life for a long time [21], the understanding and development of advanced nanomaterials are relatively new [51]. In particular, there is an increasing interest in comprehending the behavior of nanoparticles (NPs) within biological systems [17]. The unique size, structure, and chemical properties of NPs introduce a wide range of new applications in many areas of research and technology, including therapeutics and diagnostics [65]. When NPs are introduced into a biological environment, they quickly become coated by surrounding biomolecules, such as proteins, unless specifically designed not to do so [14,13,38]. Research has shown that it is not the NP itself, but rather the biomolecules on its surface, that determine its interaction with living organisms. The layer of adsorbed proteins is known as the protein corona and defines the biological identity of the NPs [39,75,45]. \n\nDue to their size, NPs can distribute throughout organisms, reaching various cellular and organic compartments, and, in specific cases, they can even breach biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier [30,74]. In medicine, NPs can serve as therapeutic tools, enhancing previous techniques like drug delivery as they extend overall circulation time and the drug's efficacy [32]. However, this characteristic also raises safety concerns regarding using NPs [46,55]. Therefore, given nanotechnology's immense potential, it is crucial to comprehend whether it poses a possible threat to organisms and the environment. \n\nNumerous experiments have been conducted to understand how blood plasma proteins bind to a nanoparticle. The findings indicate that proteins adhere to the surface of the NP, forming a corona around it, consisting of two different components [43]: a hard corona (HC) comprising tightly bound proteins in direct contact with the surface, and a more dynamic soft corona (SC) that is in constant exchange with the protein solution (Fig. 1). \n\nExperiments show that the HC binds almost irreversibly to the NP, while the SC binds reversibly [39,43].",

            "text": "The most established form of nanodelivery agents are lipidbased (Langer and Folkman, 1976;Adams et al., 2017). Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have been approved by the FDA for delivery of siRNA to the liver and for mRNA vaccine delivery (Paunovska et al., 2022). LNPs are based on structures that can be formed by phospholipids in aqueous solutions, such as micelles and liposomes (Paunovska et al., 2022). Traditional LNPs contain multiple lipids, including cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), as well as cholesterol (Semple et al., 2010;Cheng et al., 2015;Paunovska et al., 2022). Variations of these components can be used to direct LNP uptake to specific vascular beds (Paunovska et al., 2018). LNPs can be used to deliver a range of RNA payloads from siRNA to mRNA (Musunuru et al., 2021;Rothgangl et al., 2021). Because systemic delivery of RNA often leads to accumulation in the liver (Li et al., 2020), various strategies have been developed to target other organs, including the lung. One strategy has been to covalently conjugate an antibody that binds plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein (PV1) to LNPs. This strategy can increase the protein expression of mRNA delivered via these antibodyconjugated LNPs by 40-fold in the lung (Li et al., 2020). Nanoparticle size is an important factor in lung localization, with 160 nm conjugated LNPs leading to greater protein expression in the lungs compared to smaller 70 nm particles (Anselmo et al., 2015;Li et al., 2020).",

Conjugation of LNPs with macromolecules, such as GALA peptide (a 30 amino acid synthetic peptide with a glutamic acid-alanine-leucine-alanine repeat) [178], or antibodies, such as anti-plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein [179], has demonstrated preferential delivery of LNPs to the lungs after intravenous administration. Importantly, LNPs interact with proteins in the blood and incorporate them onto their surfaces, forming a targeting ligand coat of serum proteins called a protein corona. This protein corona can cause unexpected tissue localization of LNPs even when formulated to be organ-specific with the SORT methodology as certain host serum proteins also contribute to organ targeting. Qiu et al. demonstrated that by altering the linker structure in the lipidoid tails of SORT LNPs, the composition of the serum proteins that are incorporated into the protein corona can be manipulated to shift the LNPs towards lung-specific delivery [180].",

The exact proteins assigned in these groups are listed in Table S1 provided in the supplementary information. \n\nThis classification highlighted patterns in the composition of the protein corona forming on the nanoparticles surface. The corona of unmodified SiNPs was enriched in coagulation factors: 60.28 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 76.07 \u00b5g/mg in plasma. However, it contained lower amounts of immunoglobulins (10.19 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 6.25 \u00b5g/mg in plasma) as well as albumin (8.51 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 5.59 \u00b5g/mg in plasma). AC particles had the highest amount of complement system proteins, binding 14.13 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 14.79 \u00b5g/mg in plasma. OD particles had the highest amount of albumin adsorbed 21.33 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 21.59 \u00b5g/mg in plasma. Interestingly, the percentage of lipoproteins bound in the hard corona increased with surface charge, adsorbing in larger amounts on the positively charged AA particles (41.56 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 42.89 \u00b5g/mg in plasma) and the least on negatively charged and hydrophilic AC particles (18.99 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 20.42 in plasma).",

            "text": "After injection into the body, the nanocarriers will travel along the bloodstream and face numerous components in the blood such as proteins. Due to their attractive surface charges, the proteins can be electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of nanocarriers, which is known as protein corona, hereby changing the nanocarriers' surface properties, covering the targeting moieties and finally impacting cellular uptake. 22 Therefore, the effect of the protein corona was studied in terms of toxicity, uptake and protein pattern as well as protein identification to understand the uptake behavior, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. SiNCs were incubated with human serum (HS) prior to adding them to CD8 + T-cells in medium containing different percentages of HS. The results indicate that the protein corona reduced the toxicity for all SiNCs compared to uncoated NCs ( Figure 4A). It was also found that the medium containing a higher percentage of HS contributed to enhancement of cell viability similar to previous study. 25 However, the uptake was dramatically decreased in all cases compared to the uncoated NCs, together with increasing of %HS in the medium, especially at 10% HS ( Figure 4B). These results suggest that the uptake of SiNCs in CD8 + T-cells was inhibited by the adsorbed protein forming protein corona, which can be observed from the pre-coated NCs. In addition, the different concentrations of serum might result in differences in corona composition leading to a decreased uptake with increasing  serum concentration. For gold nanoparticles, it was found that the corona inhibited caveolae-mediated endocytosis resulting in decreased uptake in human epidermal keratinocytes. 40 After forming the protein corona, the physicochemical properties of SiNCs were analyzed. Overall, the hydrodynamic size increased for all SiNCs (Table S1, Supporting Information). The \u03b6-potential after corona was about \u221220 mV for NCs as the surface was saturated with a high amount of adsorbed proteins (Table S1, Supporting Information). There were no significant differences in the surface charges after corona formation of the various nanoparticles, which was also reported in the literature. 41 In order to understand the reason for the inhibited cellular",

            "text": "Also, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

Whether the ionizable surface lipids drive the ''Protein adsorption/uptake\" has not yet been thoroughly investigated but they are likely involved in protein/apoE corona formation on the LNP surface. Note that many structural and biological properties of LNPs should be ascribed not to a single lipid component but rather a combination of lipids, as illustrated above. This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif. The light blue highlight illustrates that PEG-lipids containing a long lipid tail improve the in vivo stability of LNPs.

In particular, most materials, upon contact with biological matrices, are immediately coated by proteins, leading to a protein \"corona\" [65]. Protein coronas are complex and variable. Certain components of the nanoparticle corona, called opsonins, may enhance uptake of the coated material by cells of the RES. The presence of opsonins on the particle surface creates a \"molecular signature\" which is recognized by immune cells and determines the route of particle internalization. The route of internalization affects the eventual fate of the nanoparticle in the body (i.e. its rate of clearance from the bloodstream, volume of distribution, organ disposition, and rate and route of clearance from the body). The cells of RES are capable of mopping up particles that they do not recognise as self i.e. particles they recognise as foreign. The negative effect can however, be remedied by linking of polyethylene glycol molecules to the lipid nanoparticles, thus increasing their hydrophilicity and the residence time of these particles in circulation. Alternatively, the lipid nanoparticles could be engineered to evade these RES cells by limiting the particle sizes to about 200 nm or less. It is believed that these cells do not recognise low nanometer-sized particles as foreign. Several other varied and unrelated challenges are encountered in lipid nanoparticle technology. These challenges constitute a serious research question which current strategies are targeted to address.",

            "text": "The development of assays that exploit aggregation of gold nanoparticles (NPs) has been widely studied for detection of biomolecules in diagnostics. These assays are often based on antibody\u2013antigen interactions to mediate aggregation of NPs. However, the protein parameters underlying the performance of these assays are not well understood. In this study, we systematically examine how the nature of the protein corona on the NPs, formed from either antibody or antigen, and how the number of binding sites or epitopes on the antigen affect aggregation. We selected two small antigen proteins: 13 kDa recombinant dengue viral envelope domain III protein with a polyhistidine tag (DIII-His), and 19 kDa vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), to form protein corona around NPs and study the aggregation induced by their monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. We then reciprocated the systems to form protein corona with the antibodies and compared the aggregation induced by the antigens. We showed that the nature of the protein corona matters, as the corona formed from antigens had lower limits of detection and elicited greater degrees of NP aggregation compared to the corona formed from antibodies. Furthermore, the number of epitopes on the antigen matters, as polyclonal antibodies, which target multiple epitopes on the antigen, were able to induce aggregation for both antigen- and antibody-corona systems. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies that target a single epitope on the antigens induced aggregation for the antigen-corona system only. Our results showed that an understanding of the antibody\u2013antigen system is crucial for establishing guidelines for rational selection of proteins in the design of aggregation-based assays with NPs.",

            "text": "As we discussed previously, when the nanoparticle enters the bloodstream it encounters hydrodynamic forces and a corona of bloodstream proteins forms on its surface; a subset of these proteins form the highly specific complement activation reaction that leads to removal by macrophages. Regarding behavior in the bloodstream and the effect of size and shape (Shah et al., 2011), the most suitable method is not MD, but rather a combination of theoretical calculation (Decuzzi et al., 2005) and a discretized continuum model known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), described and used to model this by Li et al. (2014b), Gupta (2016), and Gao et al. (2020) to model nanoparticle transport in the faulty tumor vasculature (Gao et al.). As we have mentioned, the formation of the protein corona is an extremely complex process that still remains poorly understood. What is clear, however, is that the surface properties of the nanoparticle affect this and the mechanism through which the protective polymer corona increases the bloodstream lifetime is modulation of the interaction with bloodstream proteins. Schafer et al. (2017) and Settanni et al. (2017aSettanni et al. ( ,b, 2018 combined experimental analysis with MD to study the interaction between two protective polymers, PEG and poly-sarcosine, with a set of proteins found in the bloodstream. They found evidence that the interactions are not amino acid specific but rather a general tendency dependent on the charge and polarity of the amino acid and the nature of the interaction between the polymer and water, in addition to the direct polymer-protein interaction. Their methodology, synergistically combined with experimental work, could provide a route to a rational design approach to the development of new polymer materials being developed that may have superior performance as a protective polymer corona. Lee et al. used the coarse grained MARTINI model to directly simulate the effect of PEGylation and PEGylation density on the interaction between the liposome and blood stream proteins; Lee also used MD simulation with atomistic resolution to study the effect of nanoparticle electrostatics in protein corona formation (Lee, 2020a). There are other examples of the use of MD modeling to study the protein corona of nanoparticles (",

            "text": "The delivery system for mRNA vaccines is a critical component of their development and success. For COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect the mRNA from degradation by endonucleases as it circulates in the body and is delivered into cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate protein translation. LNPs, the primary delivery vehicle for these vaccines, consist of four main components: neutral phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 2) [23,24]. \n\nThe LNPs encapsulate the mRNA by using positively charged amine groups at low pH, which interact with the negatively charged mRNA during the manufacturing process. This positive charge not only aids in mRNA encapsulation but also facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the cell membrane during internalization. PEG lipids play a crucial role in stabilizing the nanoparticles, controlling particle size, and preventing aggregation during storage. The rapid mixing technique used in production results in particles within the size range of 60-100 nm [25]. Additionally, LNPs contain apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is essential for the internalization of mRNA via endosomal pathways, further protecting the mRNA from degradation. Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway [26].",

            "text": "This review describes the formation of a protein corona (or its absence) on different classes of nanoparticles, its basic principles, and its consequences for nanomedicine. For this purpose, it describes general concepts to control (guide/minimize) the interaction between artificial nanoparticles and plasma proteins to reduce protein corona formation. Thereafter, methods for the qualitative or quantitative determination of protein corona formation are presented, as well as the properties of nanoparticle surfaces, which are relevant for protein corona prevention (or formation). Thereby especially the role of grafting density of hydrophilic polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle is discussed to prevent the formation of a protein corona. In this context also the potential of detergents (surfactants) for a temporary modification as well as grafting\u2010to and grafting\u2010from approaches for a permanent modification of the surface are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting several promising avenues. This includes (i) the use of nanoparticles without protein corona for active targeting, (ii) the use of synthetic nanoparticles without protein corona formation to address the immune system, (iii) the recollection of nanoparticles with a defined protein corona after in vivo application to sample the blood proteome and (iv) further concepts to reduce protein corona formation.",

            "text": "Corbo et al. [199] compared the temporal evolution of the protein corona around leukosomes and control liposomes (~170 nm diameter each), and also their uptake by macrophages. Leukosomes are liposomes with leukocyte membrane proteins, including IgG receptors, coagulation factors, and complement proteins, introduced in the liposomal lipid bilayer to obtain NPs mimicking the activity of natural leukocytes. Both types of NPs were injected into the tail vein of healthy mice; blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture 10 min and 1 h after injection and the proteins adsorbed to the liposomes were identified by MS. Overall, leukosomes adsorbed fewer protein types than liposomes. One of those, clusterin, was exclusively found in the leukosomal corona. Interestingly, the protein corona formed in vivo increased the uptake of liposomes by immune cells but decreased the uptake of leukosomes. The authors suggested that the interaction of IgGs and other corona proteins with the receptors on the leukosomes prevented them from binding to their receptors on the macrophages. \n\nRecently, Hadjidemetriou et al. [200] presented a proof-ofconcept clinical study on in-vivo corona formation onto PEGylated liposomal NPs in humans, which had been infused intravenously into patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma. Protein-coated liposomes were subsequently recovered from the blood, separated from blood components, and the adsorbed proteins were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The most abundant protein classes were Igs, lipoproteins, and complement proteins, in agreement with an earlier study on mice [197]. Moreover, more protein species were identified in the in-vivo corona than in its counterpart ex-vivo corona. Interestingly, the most abundant serum protein, albumin, was essentially absent from the in-vivo corona. Instead, low-abundance, low-molecular weight proteins were present. In a subsequent study, liposomal NPs were used as tools to fingerprint the blood proteome [201].",

            "text": "interesting observation is that nanoparticle uptake is lower at higher serum content. Similar observations were already reported for experiments where the excess proteins were left in situ, 12,67 possibly due to competition with the corona proteins for the same receptors. 10 However, here lower uptake was observed also after corona isolation and removal of excess free proteins. The lower uptake could be related to specific differences in corona composition. For instance, a study on macrophages suggested that the presence of histidinerich glycoprotein in the corona is associated with a decreased uptake. 68 Here, similarly, the observed higher abundance of this protein in the corona formed at higher serum content could be one of the factors contributing to their lower uptake. Further studies are necessary to fully demonstrate similar effects connected to the relative abundance of individual proteins in the corona.\n\nNext to this, the results suggest that multiple uptake mechanisms seem involved at the same time in the uptake of nanoparticles. It has been previously hypothesized that, within a sample, multiple subpopulations of different coronas may be formed, 7 and this could explain\ue0d5at least in part\ue0d5the observed co-presence of different uptake mechanisms. More subtle changes of corona composition over time and during exposure to cells could also explain this observation. Further studies are required to fully characterize the molecular details of the mechanisms involved in each case, possibly combining the use of transport inhibitors and RNA interference with other methods, such as the use of genetically modified cells.\n\nOverall, these results clearly highlight the importance of defining what the \"correct corona\" is for each nanomedicine (or nanoparticle) when investigating its behavior on cells. For instance, for nanomedicines administered by injection, not only higher serum content but also other factors likely to affect corona composition should be considered, such as the presence of blood flow and the more complex composition of plasma in vivo (as opposed to the serum used here). 13,36 Similar considerations should also be applied to nanomedicines administered via different routes, for instance inhaled or ingested nanomedicines, for which a serum corona may be not relevant. Additionally, other more complex factors such as the evolution of corona composition over time and changes due to the interaction with secreted cellular biomolecules may also affect the uptake mechanisms",

Specifically, positively charged LNPs predominantly accumulate in the lungs of mice, while near-neutral LNPs present a liver accumulation. Therefore, the manipulation of surface charge by LNP formulation emerges as a feasible way to achieve the organ-selective delivery of LNPs. The systematic-selective lipid nanoparticle (Liver-LNPs) system is a classic four-component formulation that consists of cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DSPC), poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-lipid), and ionizable lipids (Fig. 3b). The ionizable lipid can be converted into its quaternary ammonium salt form via a simple and effective reaction with methyl iodide to afford a cationic targeting lipid (Fig. 3a). By adding the additional permanently cationic targeting lipid and replacing DSPC with 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the Liver-LNP formulation (Fig. 3b), we successfully obtained lung-selective LNPs (Lung-LNPs), which were capable of precisely delivering mRNA to the lungs. mRNA-loaded LNPs were formed by mixing an aqueous buffer solution containing mRNA and a lipid ethanol solution at the aqueousto-ethanol ratio of 3/1, v/v. Firefly luciferase mRNA (mRNA Luci ) was encapsulated by the two organ-selective LNPs, giving Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci . Both the obtained Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci were uniformly spherical assemblies with a diameter of ~60-100 nm according to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c).",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), can be seen as natural nanoparticles. However, EVs are produced under different cell culture conditions and little is known about the protein corona forming on EVs and its influence on their uptake by target cells. Here, we use a proteomic approach in order to analyze the protein composition of the EVs themselves and the protein composition of a human blood plasma protein corona around EVs. Moreover, we analyze the influence of the protein corona on EV uptake into human monocytes and compare it with the influence on the uptake of engineered liposomes. We show that the presence of a protein corona increases the uptake of EVs in human monocytes. While for liposomes this seems to be triggered by the presence of immunoglobulins in the protein corona, for EVs blocking the Fc receptors on monocytes did not show an influence of uptake. Therefore, other mechanisms of docking to the cell membrane and uptake are most like involved, demonstrating a clear difference between EVs and liposomes as technically produced nanocarriers.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been successful in delivering nucleic acids like siRNA and mRNA, but face challenges in protein delivery due to limited protein encapsulation and endosome escape. In this study, a family of LNPs is developed with robust high efficiency in addressing the multiple barriers in cytosolic protein delivery by incorporating clinically approved ionizable lipids into traditional cationic LNPs. The combination of cationic and ionizable lipids enables efficient protein binding and endosomal escape. Optimized LNPs efficiently deliver various proteins, including antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and Cas9 into living cells with reserved functions. Moreover, the designed LNPs show high serum stability during protein delivery, and the serum albumin adsorbed on LNPs facilitates protein delivery via albumin receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, enabling highly efficient protein delivery in vivo. The optimized LNPs successfully deliver therapeutic proteins such as saporin and interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010) to inhibit tumor growth in several animal models. The IL\u201010 loaded LNPs enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and improved the antitumor effect of adoptive transferred OT\u20101 CD8+ T cells to melanoma. This study expands the applications of LNPs for the delivery of biomacromolecules, and the developed LNP formulations have enormous potential for the delivery of protein therapeutics to treat various diseases.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly prevalent in our society, with applications ranging from nanomedicine, photovoltaics, cosmetics and beyond. Despite the ubiquity of their use, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how NPs interact with their local environments. This poor understanding becomes a critical problem when using NPs in real-life situations. Notably, it has been well documented that introducing NPs into biological fluids results in the formation of a surrogated biological identity known as the biomolecular corona, which is the spontaneous adsorption of proteins 1 , lipids 2 , sugar moieties 3 , nucleic acids 4 and metabolites 5,6 onto nanomaterial surfaces. The composition of the biomolecular corona strongly determines the ultimate fate of NPs [7][8][9] . As most studies that address the biomolecular corona formation have focused on proteins adsorbed to the surface of NPs 10 , together with the fact that the predominant model for the formation of the biomolecular corona is hegemonized by the direct adsorption of proteins from biological milieus 11 , this Review comprehensively focuses on the protein corona. \n\nThe emergence of the concept of the protein corona in nanomedicine substantially altered perspectives of researchers and interpretation of biosystem-NP interactions. The first critical milestone occurred in 2007 when Dawson's group conceived the term protein corona 12 . However, protein corona studies commenced as early as the late 1950s 13 and early 1960s 14,15 under a slightly different terminology and a colloidal science context. The characterization of protein coronas has revealed that the adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials can have mixed biological effects. Protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and the complexities of biological matrices, can unpredictably change NP outcomes including function 16 , uptake 17,18 , biodistribution 19,20 , immunological responses 10,21 and toxicity 22,23 , and can thus be a challenge for therapeutic nanomedicine.",

            "text": "In other words, the biomolecular corona formed in surfactantcontaining media becomes less biocompatible, with its composition varying based on the surface properties of the NPs. \n\nInvestigation of the lipid and protein corona composition after exposure to pulmonary surfactants from porcine lung lavage was reported by Raesch et al. 23 The study was performed for three different NP coatings: phosphatidylcholine coating (lipid-NP), PEG5000 coating (PEG-NP), and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) coating (PLGA-NP). It was found that the amount of lipids adsorbed was dependent on the NPs' surface properties. In particular, the highest amount of lipids was detected for lipid-NPs, while the smallest amount was detected for PEG-NPs. However, the total lipid composition did not show any relevant differences in both coronas, in contrast to the changes observed in the protein composition. These results indicate that the corona might be of great importance for further interactions with the lung cells, especially in the alveolar region, since some proteins induce agglomeration of NPs, which in turn favours phagocytosis by macrophages and/or protein-mediated binding for particle internalisation. Gasser et al. also used porcine lung lavage to understand how the presence of pulmonary surfactant influences the adsorption of biomolecules to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MWCNTs functionalised with positively (-NH 2 ) and negatively (-COOH) charged side groups. 111 They showed that surfactant lipids exhibit nonspecific binding to different functionalized MWCNTs. This behavior contrasts with the selective and characteristic binding patterns observed in the blood plasma proteins during corona formation. In later research, they used the same particles to demonstrate that the pulmonary surfactant coating of the nanotubes decreases their oxidative and pro-inflammatory potential, highlighting the relevance of the corona. Moreover, this surfactant coating not only affects how NMs interact with lung cells, but also affects their biodistribution and toxicity in secondary target organs. 112 In vivo studies also support the latter findings.",

There were no significant differences in the surface charges after corona formation of the various nanoparticles, which was also reported in the literature. 41 In order to understand the reason for the inhibited cellular uptake of protein-coated NCs, the composition of protein corona was further analyzed. The corona pre-formed SiNCs were centrifuged to remove the loosely bound proteins, which comprise the \"soft corona\". The proteins adsorbed on SiNC surfaces were desorbed and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 5A). The silver-stained gel revealed different \"hard corona\" patterns for the 7 different SiNCs. Some small proteins in the size of 6-16 kDa were only found in the corona of NC(i)-LUT with and without NH 2 -functionalization. These results indicate that the physicochemical properties of the NCs had a strong effect on corona composition. Furthermore, the total protein amount adsorbed per m 2 SiNC was calculated ( Figure 5B). The NC(o) had a higher amount of protein adsorbed on the surface compared to NC(i). In our previous work we showed by NMR that the oil-water exchange results in further hydrolysis of the alkoxysilanes. 42 Therefore, this process has an influence on the silica network. Based on this, we assume that NC(i) are more hydrophilic compared to NC(o), which affects the adsorption of blood proteins. In literature, it was shown that a hydrophobic surface of nanoparticles also results in an increased adsorption of proteins compared to a hydrophilic surface. 42 Among the hydrophilic core, NC(i)-CTAC had the highest amount of protein adsorbed. It can be observed that the protein amount was decreased with increasing NH 2 -functionalization.\n\nIn \"hard corona\", proteins were analyzed by LC-MS. Proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (e.g. histidinerich glycoprotein, kininogen, plasminogen, and vitronectin) were the dominant protein group for all SiNCs ( Figure 5C and D",

            "text": "When NPs come into contact with biological fluids, biomolecules adhere to their surfaces, forming a corona composed of multiple layers that influence how these NPs interact with cells and their biological effects. In protein-rich environments, such as blood or serum, strong protein-NP interactions form a hard corona. In contrast, weaker protein-protein and protein-NP interactions give rise to a soft corona. The hard corona is characterized by proteins that adsorb irreversibly onto the NP, whereas the soft corona consists of a fluid layer of loosely bound proteins associated with the NP. Understanding the dynamics of each component of the protein corona is essential for various biological applications of nanotechnology [59]. \n\nHowever, measuring the soft corona poses significant experimental challenges [26]. In-situ detection methods, which aim to preserve the protein corona in its physiological environment, demand advanced technical skills and involve complex procedures, such as tagging proteins with fluorescent markers and using dynamic light scattering. These modifications risk altering protein binding capacities, thereby complicating accurate measurements. Ex-situ methods, such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, struggle with the incomplete separation of NP-protein complexes, which can lead to misidentifying the protein corona constituents. Additionally, excessive centrifugal force during separation may result in the loss of protein corona components, further complicating accurate detection. \n\nTherefore, the composition of the protein corona has traditionally been examined, either in vivo or in vitro, through static incubation methods. Nevertheless, this approach limits our ability to explore the dynamics of the corona components over biologically relevant timescales. Here, we present new findings for a computational method that enables us to integrate experimental results and comprehensively describe the dynamics of both the hard and soft corona. \n\nWe extend the modeling and computational approach we previously introduced, incorporating the study of the soft corona into analyzing the short-and long-term kinetics of the hard corona formed by different proteins competing for the NP surface [70]. The method employs a coarse-grained description of globular proteins interacting with the NP through colloid-like effective potential energies.",

PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": "Circulating proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface of liposomes, forming a protein corona that is the interface for biological interactions (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016). The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015;Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016;Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2005;Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins. This may especially be relevant for cancer nanomedicines due to profound and heterogenous immune dysfunction associated with different types of cancer (Rosenberg, 2001). A major implication of this is that in vitro studies and studies in \"healthy\" animals are not sufficient to fully characterize the protein corona and biological impact of liposomal drugs intended for treatment of cancer. \n\nLiposome interactions with circulating complement proteins can also lead to activation of the complement cascade (Alving, 1992;Verma et al., 1992;Szebeni et al., 2002;Dobrovolskaia et al., 2008), generating complement cleavage products that are opsonins (e.g., C3b) and fragments that are anaphylatoxins (e.g., C5a). The latter have been associated with development of acute infusion reactions in patients known as complement activationrelated pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003).",

            "text": "In order to reach their receptors in vivo, nanoparticles will be first exposed to a complex biological fluid, such as for instance serum. In this environment, various proteins and other biomolecules will adsorb on the nanoparticle surface forming a biomolecular corona. This layer will then replace the synthetic identity of bare nanoparticles and in some cases it can mask the ligands of functionalized nanoparticles, which may result in the loss of targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015). Additionally, some proteins with high binding affinity can strongly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface for a long period of time, creating a layer called the hard corona. In contrast to the soft corona, where proteins can be easily replaced by other proteins following dynamic changes of the surrounding environment, the hard corona is highly resistant toward such changes. Overall, this complex and dynamic layer confers nanoparticles a new biological identity. The eventual interactions between nanoparticles and cell receptors, thus receptor recognition and nanoparticle uptake, can all be affected by the presence of this layer. Strategies have been developed to prevent the formation of the biomolecular corona and maintain targeting efficiency, for instance, by creating a stealth layer using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other special polymers or by introducing zwitterionic modifications on the nanoparticle surface (Veronese and Pasut, 2005;Yuan et al., 2012;Garc\u00eda et al., 2014;Moyano et al., 2014;Pozzi et al., 2014;Alberg et al., 2020). However, it has been shown that in the case of PEGylated surfaces, nanoparticles still could adsorb proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016a). \n\nGiven the crucial role of the biomolecular corona and cell receptors in mediating nanoparticle uptake and determining their intracellular fate, it is of great importance to study in more detail the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors. Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors.",

            "text": "systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo, toxicity, and targeting capability [27]. In this sense, the change in the particle diameter during the incubation in human plasma may have been due to the destabilization of the system in terms of particle agglomeration, or, more likely, the formation of a protein corona [28]. This phenomenon could be observed at the first time points of the incubation of the formulations, which points to the dynamic process of protein corona formation, i.e., the constant adsorption and desorption of proteins from the particles' surfaces, which is especially emphasized during the formation of the initial, \"soft\" corona [30]. except for NLCPOL, where there was noted a significant change in the z-average diameter after 24 h of incubation time (p = 0.0101; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2a). Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~",

            "text": "In addition to carrier proteins found in blood and proteins involved in haemostasis, mass spectrometry analysis also revealed the high level of complement factors in the protein corona of studied nanoparticles, especially of complement component 3 (C3) that associated with complexes most abundantly in murine serum. Nanoparticles are cleared from the bloodstream by opsonisation that is induced by antibodies and complement proteins associating with exogenous particles; and C3 plays a central role in the activation of complement system via all three pathways, [82][83][84] and thus, opsonisation [83,85]. Therefore, we further focused on the level of C3 in the corona formed under different conditions, i.e., in the plasma that contains active complement factors as compared with serum, where these were inactivated by heating. As previously, pDNA and SCO were complexed with CPPs, and resulting nanoparticles were incubated with serum or plasma. After pull-down with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, C3 levels in protein corona were analysed by Western blot using an antibody to the C-terminus of C3 that recognizes C3 \u03b1-chain and also fragment 2 of \u03b1-chain that corresponds to C3d [86]. First, we evaluated adsorption of C3 to pDNA complexed with PF14, NF55, and C22-PF14. After 60 min incubation with murine serum (Figure 3a Figure S2 (Supplementary Materials)) no significant difference in C3 levels was detected between nanoparticles formed with different CPPs. However, pDNA alone and NF55-pDNA complexes showed tendency to adsorb a higher amount of complement proteins as compared to nanoparticles containing PF14 and C22-PF14 (Figure 3, Figure S3 (Supplementary Materials)), although this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, our results showed that after 60 min incubation, the level of C3 \u03b1-chain fragment 2 bound to PF14-pDNA nanoparticles was lower than after incubation for 60 min that was in line with time-dependent adsorption of proteins on nanoparticles [17,59]",

            "text": "Lipids-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are unique nanostructures, composed of various types of lipids, including cationic or ionizable lipids (CIL), structural lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), and PEG-binding lipids (PEG-Derived phospholipids) (Patel et al., 2019). Among them, ionizable lipids are the key components that determine the titer, mRNA delivery efficiency, degradability, and reactivity (Drescher and van Hoogevest, 2020). At low pH, ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic buffers, producing a positive charge and binding to negatively charged mRNA, whereas they remain neutral at physiological pH (Chan et al., 2021;Scalzo et al., 2022). The delivery mechanism of LNPs is shown in Figure 4. Ionizable lipids are less cytotoxic than cationic lipids. This is because the positive charge of cationic lipids typically interacts with negatively charged molecules on the cell surface, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. In contrast, ionizable lipids can dynamically regulate their charge state in the cellular environment, avoiding the continuous release of positive charges to the cell surface and reducing cytotoxicity (Sharma et al., 2014). In general, PEGbound lipids in LNPs occupy the smallest molar percentage, which can enhance particle stability by affecting charge distribution, size, and dispersion, and hinder LNPs from aggregating, playing a crucial role in blood circulation and biological distribution (Albertsen and Camilla et al., 2022;Kon et al., 2022;Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2023). Structural lipids are chiefly used to support the structure of particles and enhance stability during storage and circulation (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Witzigmann et al., 2020). According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023).",

            "text": "Over the past few decades, nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic systems have gained immense recognition. A relative improvement in the status of the global cancer burden has been successful due to the advent of nanoparticle-based formulations. However, exposure of nanoparticles (NPs) to a real-time biological media alters its native identity due to the formation of the biomolecular corona. Such biological interactions hinder the efficiency of the NPs system. The parameters that govern such intricate interaction are generally overlooked while designing nano drugs and delivery systems (nano-DDS). Fabricating nano-DDS with prolonged circulation time, enhanced drug-loading, and release capacity along with efficient clearance, remain the primary concerns associated with cancer therapeutics. This present review firstly aims to summarize the critical aspects that influence protein coronation on therapeutic nanoparticles designed for anti-cancer therapy. The role of protein corona in modifying the overall pharmacodynamics of the nanoparticle-based DDS has been discussed. Further, the studies and patents that extend the concept of protein corona into diagnostics have been elaborated. An understanding of the pros and cons associated with protein coronation would not only help us gain better insights into the fabrication of effective anti-cancer drug-delivery systems but also improve the shortcomings related to the clinical translation of these nanotherapeutics.",

Moreover, various techniques for controlling LNP effects on the immune system should be established. \n\nIn this review, we discuss innate immunity and acquired immunity and their relationship to understand the immune function of LNPs.

The characteristics of these proteins, which are one of the substantial factors in cellular response, are affected by the interactions between the nanomaterials and the biological systems. Many studies have investigated the biological behaviors of nanomaterials by conducting experiments in vitro and in vivo; however, the origin of the biological materials used is rather inconsistent. This is due to the fact that the composition of the protein coronas may differ depending on the animal origin, not on the composition or size of the nanoparticles. The resulting differences in the composition of the protein coronas can lead to different conclusions. To identify the differences in protein corona formation among sera of different species, we investigated protein coronas of gold and silica nanoparticles in serum obtained from various species. Using comparative proteomic analysis, common proteins adsorbed onto each nanoparticle among the three different sera were identified as highly abundant proteins in the serum. These findings indicate that protein corona formation is dependent on the serum population rather than the size or type of the nanoparticles. Additionally, in the physiological classification of protein coronas, human serum (HS) was found to be rich in apolipoproteins. In conclusion, our data indicate that HS components are different from those of bovine or mouse, indicating that the serum species origin should be carefully considered when selecting a biological fluid.",

There is an increasing number of reports summarizing large data sets of all identified corona proteins. However, to date our knowledge about the multiple mechanisms mediating interactions between proteins and nanocarriers is still limited. In this study, we investigate the influence of protein structure on the adsorption process and focus on the effect of heat inactivation of serum and plasma, which is a common cell culture procedure used to inactivate the complement system. As in general routine lab procedure, heat inactivation was performed at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min in order to denature heat labile proteins. When nanocarriers were exposed to native versus heat inactivated serum, we saw that the cellular uptake by macrophages was significantly affected. These results were then correlated with an altered corona composition that depended on the treatment of the protein source. In summary, we were able to prove that the protein structure is one of the key parameters determining protein corona formation.",

At higher plasma concentrations, free HDL functioned antagonistically, whereas 444 reduced plasma concentrations resulted in lower free HDL, greater particle uptake and, 445 subsequently, improved mRNA expression. At the lowest lean plasma concentrations, there was 446 not enough HDL to populate LNP coronas, especially when using high doses of LNPs and this 447 degraded LNP performance. The number of HDL particles is, however, elevated in obese rat 448 plasma, so the LNPs remained functional even at low obese plasma concentrations, and under 449 these conditions, there was also less competition from unbound HDL. Taken together, these results 450 are first to indicate that LNP designs that encourage association with HDL or HDL components 451 will improve LNP performance by tipping the balance between LNP uptake and, free-HDL 452 blockade of cellular uptake mechanisms (such as SR-B1 53 ). The OPLS analysis also indicated that lipids (rather than lipoproteins) were contributive but less 465 decisive for LNPs' performance. Although one lipid hit LPC 20:1 did display a negative 466 correlation to LNP performance, and LNPs formulated with LPC demonstrated increased tropism 467 towards liver endothelial cells 56 , making LPC 20:1 a potential candidate for delivery to tissues 468 other than liver hepatocytes. 469\n\nIn summary, we have created an efficient method for isolating LNPs, with intact coronas from 470 plasma followed by an automated and unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of corona protein and 471 lipid content.

Our study identified a lipoprotein fingerprint that promotes LNP function, leading us to 474 examine the role of HDL-LNP interactions as an essential factor for LNP efficacy.

Furthermore, we describe a whole blood model which we have developed to monitor activation and interaction between different components of innate immunity: blood protein cascade systems, platelets, leukocytes, cytokine generation, which are induced by NPs. Finally, we describe our own studies on innate immunity system activation induced by three fundamentally different species of NPs (two types of engineered NPs and diesel NPs) as demonstrator of the utility of an initial determination of the composition of the protein corona formed on NPs exposed to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma and subsequent analysis in our whole blood model.",

Thus, the rational design of LNP carriers, in the context of linking the structural features of key components to their functional roles and proposing target-specific adjust-ment, is a step forward for future LNP-based gene delivery applications. \n\nThe path to achieving the rational design of LNP carriers requires a better understanding of the LNP structures, which is the core of the LNP's formulation\u2212structure\u2212function relationship.

            "text": "Background/Objectives: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are leading mRNA delivery vehicles, with ionizable lipids (ILs) as their key component. However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and",

            "text": "Depending on the particle surface and cell type, pre-adsorption of a protein corona can result in a reduced or enhanced uptake of nanoparticles by the recipient cells (Berrecoso et al., 2020). Here, we tested the influence on uptake of EVs that expose on their surface a protein corona or not in human phagocytes (THP1, moDCs) and as a non-phagocytic cell type, the cells the EVs were derived from (HCT 116), thus simulating the uptake by neighbouring or distant tumour cells (e.g., metastases). To this end, we incubated 10 \u03bcg mL \u22121 of Cy5-labelled liposomes or EVs with human blood plasma at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h and subsequently isolated them by centrifugation. The last pellet resulting from centrifugation was re-suspended in serum-free cell culture medium to perform the cell uptake under serum-free conditions for samples with and without pre-adsorbed protein corona. This was done to avoid the formation of a serum protein corona on plain EVs or exchange of proteins from the pre-formed human plasma protein corona with serum proteins from fetal calf serum (FCS). In our study, we focus on the difference between particles with and without a pre-formed protein corona. Thus, our results inform about the contribution of corona proteins and neglect the eventual effect of additional free plasma proteins. However, Yang et al. demonstrate that free serum proteins can also contribute to the differential uptake in presence of a protein corona as they for example, compete with particles for receptor binding. This effect might also play a role in EV uptake in presence of a human plasma protein corona. The uptake of EVs and liposomes with and without a protein corona was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 3). As shown in SI Figure 5 the vesicles differed in fluorescence intensity due to inequalities during the labelling process which is inherent to the amounts of possibly reactive side groups. Therefore, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values cannot be directly compared between vesicle types.",

            "text": "In an in vitro toxicity assay, the cell culture medium contains protein serum and a similar corona formation is expected. Some studies have described the effect of serum on nanomaterial toxicity [14,19,25,35,[40][41][42]. Corona formation was found to affect hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, nanoparticle uptake and endothelial cell death [19]. When in contact with a biological environment, the protein corona confers on NPs a new bioidentity. Some of the proteins in this corona can be recognized by specific cell membrane receptors, triggering internalization mechanisms that are different to those generated by pristine NPs [40]. Once inside cells, NPs may cause adverse effects and permanent cell damage. Mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, genetic instability, and the inhibition of correct cell division may be involved and may contribute to cell death [5]. \n\nIn this context, hepatic HepG2 cells were exposed to three different concentrations of pristine M-MSNs. A dose-dependent response of the HepG2 cell index was observed with exposure to pristine nanoparticles (Fig 4). HepG2 cells were then exposed to M-MSNs covered with coronas of two different species origins, each at two different concentrations (Fig 5). M-MSNs covered with bovine proteins induced similar effects to pristine NPs at both doses tested 50 \u03bcg/ mL (Fig 5A ) and 100 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 5B). This result is related to the kinetics of corona formation [18,23,36]. Indeed, corona formation begins as soon as NPs are in contact with the proteins contained in the culture medium. We have previously shown that after 30 seconds the corona has already formed around the NP [18]. Thus, by the time the nanoparticles and cells come into contact, the corona has already formed around the pristine M-MSNs, producing similar effects to those elicited by a 24-hour preformed FBS corona. The formation of the corona occurs within the first minutes. [18,19].",

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.",

            "text": "Based on the data in Fig. 3a, LNPs would need to be administered to the patient under fasting conditions to minimize the aggregation effect of pepsin. A similar study investigating nanoparticle stability in the presence of pepsin reported that solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and lipid nanoemulsions did not change particle size in the presence of pepsin at a concentration representative of a fasted stomach (0.32% w/v) 47 . However, at the same pepsin concentration, a study of miltefosine-loaded lipid nanoparticles reported a three-fold increase in particle size 48 . The mechanism of pepsin-induced LNP aggregation is unclear. Previous studies have reported that PEG and pepsin may interact electrostatically through the protonated carboxyl groups of the pepsin and the ether of the PEG by hydrogen bond formation 49 . Spelzini and colleagues observed that lower molecular weight PEGs, like the one used on LNPs, are more hydrophobic in an extended conformation with a higher capacity to interact with the pepsin protein domain 50 . The pepsin and PEG2000 on the outer surface of the LNPs could be favorably interacting to cause the formation of aggregates that prevent the LNPs from entering the cell. In the small intestines of humans, the fasted bile salt concentration is reported to be 2.6-6.4 mM and the fed concentration is 11-14.5 mM 33,34,51 . There is a possibility the LNPs would still result in potent intestinal gene silencing when the patient has fasted beforehand. Interestingly, the z-average diameter of the LNPs drastically decreased at a bile salt concentration of 15 mM. It is unclear why the high concentration reduced LNP size, however, it could be due to an interaction between the lipidoids in the LNP and bile salts. Bile salts are amphiphilic and self-assemble into micelles in an aqueous environment 33 . It is possible that at high concentrations, bile salts (15 mM) insert themselves into the lipid bilayer of the LNPs or solubilize some of the lipophilic components, leading to a change in particle formation.",

            "text": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.",

            "text": "Above we have described the NPs' characteristics, including their surface properties and aggregation state. As the aggregation state is determined by the surface chemistry, we will turn our attention to the biomolecular corona. Previous studies have mainly focused on the protein corona, but the corona also contains lipids [8,51,52] and likely carbohydrates. At low NP concentration levels, determining the biomolecular corona is a challenge. However, by combining the pellets, formed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, from 5 experiments, sufficient amount of material could be obtained for analysis by SDS-PAGE, S8 Fig, and mass spectrometry (see materials and methods for details). We identified several proteins (S1 Table ) in the Au NPs' corona, of which many have been previously described in the literature [31]. Proteins of a very broad size range are found on the NP surface or incorporated in complexes with the NP and other proteins. Alpha- 2-macroglobulin is the largest protein found in the corona. It has a molecular weight of 725 kDa and its dimensions are approximately 10 nm in diameter and 15-20 nm in length [53]. The protein is therefore of similar size to the smaller Au NPs and will considerably change the size and density of the NP protein complex. The lower density slows down the sedimentation rate, resulting in a smaller apparent diameter of the complex by DCS. Lipid binding proteins as apolipoprotein E and gelsolin were also found in the corona. It has been shown for polymeric and TiO 2 NPs that the lipids remain on the NP surface after binding and even have a preferential binding compared to other proteins [8,51,52]. Bound lipids will significantly change the complex' density. Apolipoprotein E is part of the lipoprotein particle chylomicrons which transport lipids in blood from the intestine. The density of chylomicrons is less than 1 g/cm 3 and their size can be more than a micrometer. The low NP concentration made it impossible to determine the lipid concentration in the pellet.",

ROS reactive oxygen species, IONPs iron oxide nanoparticles agglomeration and NET formation [95]. The nanoparticles that follow direct translocation paths may break the cell plasma membrane by interacting with the lipid bilayer molecules that transport them directly into the cytoplasm [90]. Therefore, using the cell-penetrating peptides as nanoparticle surface ligands is an alternative technique [99]. When IONPs are inserted into living organisms and encounter biological fluids, their surface immediately interacts with proteins and other macromolecules, producing a \"protein corona\" that can radically affect the aggregation state, nanomaterial size, and interfacial characteristics, thus influencing the uncontrollable biological behavior of IONPs [100]. Thus, this protein corona is primarily responsible for IONP disposition and is involved in slowing the nanoparticle degradation process [101]. However, significant deviations in IONPs with a corona produced from human plasma were detected as a function of the lipid adsorption profile [102]. IONPs were reported to be associated with inflammation and pulmonary oxidative stress [103]. Severe exposure of lung epithelial cells to IONPs may modify the cell biomechanical properties and potentially impairing the integrity of the epithelial barrier [28].",

By tuning the material properties of the nanoparticles a number of different biological applications of nanomaterials are enabled i.e. targeting, labelling, drug delivery, use as diagnostic tools or therapy. For all biological applications of nanoparticles, it is important to understand their interactions with the surrounding biological environment in order to predict their biological impact, in particular when designing the nanoparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose. Due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, the surface of nanomaterials is very reactive. When exposed to biological fluids, the proteins and biomolecules present therein tend to associate with the nanoparticles' surface. This phenomenon is defined as biomolecular corona formation. The biomolecular corona plays a key role in the interaction between nanoparticles and biological systems, impacting on how these particles interact with biological systems on a cellular and molecular level. This book chapter describes the nature of the interactions at the bio-nano interface, shows the design strategy of nanoparticles for nanomedicine, and defines the concepts of biomolecular corona and biological identity of nanoparticles. Moreover, it describes the interaction of functionalised nanomaterials with cell organelles and intracellular fate of nanoparticles and it shows therapeutic application of gold nanoparticles as dose enhancers in radiotherapy.",

It was demonstrated that natural cholesterol analogs enhance the endosomal escape of LNPs, while the presence of natural structural lipids on nanoparticle surfaces forms a corona when dispersed in biological fluids. [187] mRNA delivery to T cells was studied by creating a vast library of LNPs. Structural analogs of immune-cell targeted ionizable lipid materials were synthesized via Michael addition chemistry. Alkyl chains terminated with epoxide groups were reacted with polyamine cores of varying lengths. Using microfluidic chips, a combination of 24 ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and PEG-lipids were used to encapsulate mRNA and form LNP complexes ranging from 51 to 97 nm. Screening of the process detected improved mRNA delivery for seven LNP formulations, compared to commercially available lipofectamine. No significant correlation was observed among LNP size, concentration of the genetic molecules, or the pKa of ionizable lipid with the enhanced delivery of the cargo. Furthermore, LNPs containing purified saturated ionizable lipids improved mRNA delivery over that of crude lipid formulations. [188] LNPs were also used to deliver mRNA for hemophilia treatment. In this investigation, lipid components consisting of ionizable lipid distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid were mixed with synthesized mRNAs to synthesize mRNA LNPs. LNP complexes of sizes smaller than 100 nm, more than 80% RNA encapsulation efficiency, and less than 10 endotoxin units were obtained. Thanks to a bioluminescence signal in the liver and a weak or absence of signal in the spleen or other organs, it was suggested that LNPs efficiently delivered mRNA to the liver. Repeated injections of LNPs, however, induced the inhibitor formation of short-lived factors. [189] In the case of long-term storage of LNPs carriers, specifically COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, little is known about the physical stability of lipid nanoparticles.

            "text": ". The presence of many 327 apolipoproteins in LNP coronas correlated with LNP efficacy (-0.1<Orthogonality<0.1). In 328 particular, Apo A-II, B, C-II, and C-IV, the structural proteins found in HDL, VLDL, and 329 chylomicron (CM) lipoproteins, were positively correlated with LNPs performance. Apo M, which 330 is found primarily on HDL 46 , also exhibited a high positive correlation to LNP performance. In 331 contrast, Apo E and Apo A-IV 47 , which are primarily found in VLDL and CM demonstrated a 332 moderate negative correlation to LNPs performance (Fig. 5a). While Apo E is often considered 333 highly correlative to LNP hepatic delivery efficacy, the amount of corona Apo E in obese-plasma-334 derived coronas declined modestly compared to lean-derived counterparts ( Supplementary Fig.  335 14). Remarkably, quantitative imaging revealed that LNPs stimulated higher cellular eGFP mRNA 336 expression when supplemented with obese plasmas that resulted in coronas with less ApoE (Fig.  337 1e). As will be shown later, this is also not simply because the obese serum stimulates protein 338 production, but rather that specific plasma components accumulate in LNP coronas and this leads 339 to enhanced LNP function. 340\n\nWhile not all protein components of LNP coronas are strongly correlated with LNP function, the 341 majority of lipids associated with LNPs did correlate with enhanced LNP performance. A lipid-342 rich corona, in general, is favorable for LNP mediated mRNA delivery. However, the 343 orthogonality of lipid hits was higher than most of the protein hits (Orthogonality>0.1 or <-0.1), 344\n\nsuggesting that the corona proteins are more relevant for explaining the differences between LNP 345 function in lean and obese contexts. The plasma lipids became more relevant (orthagonality 346 dropped below 0.1 in most cases) when considering particle uptake as opposed to function. While 347 particle uptake was not our primary readout, it is interesting that PC, for example, has previously",

            "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

            "text": "Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111]. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that the liver-targeting of LNPs is mediated by the absorbed corona proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expressed on hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of LNP by liver cells [112,113]. In a recent study, Qiu et al. designed a library of O-series LNPs that contained ester bonds in their tails (Figure 4A). They discovered that 306-O12B LNPs tended to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to the liver and led to higher Angptl3 gene knockdown compared to DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (Figure 4B-D). Further studies revealed that the differentiation of tissue targeting might be determined by the corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface [114,115]. \n\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) represent one of the predominant LNP delivery systems for RNA-based drugs. Dong and colleagues designed a series of LLNs with TT3 as the core structure as depicted in Figure 5A. FTT5 LLNs were formulated to deliver FLuc mRNA in vivo, mediating the highest luminescence signal in the liver (Figure 5B). Subsequently, FTT5 LLNs were utilized to package hFVIII mRNA and adenine base editor mRNA, achieving effective hFVIII protein expression and base editing in vivo of hemophilia A (HA) mice (Figure 5C). Further study showed that FTT5 LLNs with branched ester side chains exhibited greater resistance to degradation compared to FTT9 LLNs with linear chains (Figure 5D) [116]. In an effort to develop biodegradable materials, Zhang et al. rationally designed a series of LLNs with different amines and esters, bearing varied carbon chains as shown in Figure 5E.",

            "text": "Intravenous administration of lipid nanoparticles has been the most common route to deliver therapeutic genes to endothelial cells, as these cells are located in the inner surface of blood vessels and are in direct contact with the blood. However, when nanoparticles enter the blood circulation, they are often eliminated by cells of the reticuloendothelial system or preferentially transfect hepatocytes, which prevents nanoparticles from reaching and transfecting endothelial cells [69,94,[186][187][188][189]. As such, strategies have been developed to bypass hepatocytes in order to reach and transfect endothelial cells. Among the strategies developed, the use of cationic lipids or polymers to generate nanoparticles that target endothelial cells has made considerable progress. Dorkin et al. showed that incorporation of the permanently cationic lipid, DOTAP, to LNPs that otherwise target the liver could be redirected to transfect pulmonary endothelial cells [182]. Dorkin et al. also found that liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles, which are nanoparticles that preferentially transfect hepatocytes on their own, specifically C12-200, cKK-E12, and 503O13 nanoparticles, could have a shift in their tropism and transfect pulmonary endothelial cells by incorporating the lipid DOTAP in their formulation [182]. This finding was later expanded by Cheng et al. to include additional cationic lipids, such as DDAB and EPC, to other liver-targeted nanoparticles like 5A2-SC8 and DLin-MC3-DMA to enable transfection of pulmonary endothelial cells [181]. The mechanism by which these nanoparticles target and deliver nucleic acids to the lung may be due to association with a protein or group of proteins that binds to the surface of the nanoparticles and selectively delivers them to the pulmonary endothelium [95,190]. For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191",

The synergistic effects seen between lipids is a particularly interesting property and opens up the field to investigate the possible synergistic effects of proteins and metabolites in NM uptake and distribution. \n\nA subsequent lipid corona investigation examined the adsorption of lipids to cellulose nanofibrils, titania and polystyrene NMs from serum and heavy cream to represent exposures to humans directly via blood and food products, respectively. 92 A modified Folch method was applied to isolate the lipid corona with good recoveries being found across all NMs (>50%) when validated using a mixture of lipid standards. 92 The lipid coronas isolated from the two matrices varied significantly with the serum coronas for all 3 NMs being comprised of 75% triacylglycerides (TAGs), 15-17% phospholipids and 7.5-11% diacylglycerides (DAGs) whereas for the heavy cream coronas for polystyrene and cellulose nanofibrils TAGs and DAGs made up 59% and 13-14% of the lipid corona with phospholipids accounting for a further 25% and lysophospholipids the remaining 2-3%.

            "text": "It is nowadays accepted that IONPs adsorb a plethora of ions and biological molecules (i.e., lipids, sugars, proteins) when they come into contact with biological fluids such as blood [94]. This biomolecular corona ultimately affects the interaction of non-functionalized IONPs with biological systems, a property known as \"biological identity\". The biomolecular corona must be taken into account when considering the intrinsic biological effects that IONPs can produce. Indeed, Escamilla-Rivera et al. found that PEG-coated IONPs absorb a wide variety of complement recognition proteins when incubated with human serum, leading to complement activation when injected in mice [95]. Similarly, Zhu et al. demonstrated that the addition of IONPs to the hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold enhances osteogenesis in vivo, most likely mediated by a dynamic formation of a protein corona enriched in complement-, wound healing-, and inflammatory-related factors [96]. These reports thus suggest that the protein corona can endow IONPs with immunomodulating features. However, the biomolecule corona largely depends on the surface coating of the metallic core of IONPs as demonstrated by Vogt et al. These authors found that silica-coated and dextran-coated IONPs adsorb a distinctive subset of serum proteins, which leads to a differential effect on primary human macrophages [97]. Furthermore, the inherent dynamic nature of the protein corona, more specifically the so-called soft corona that exhibits a high exchange rate, can affect the biological identity of IONPs. Ashby et al. reported that a highly hydrophobic surface coating promoted the deposition of human serum proteins having larger hydrophobic domains and a much faster exchange rate, and thus a more dynamic protein corona. A similar correlation was found between larger core diameters and protein corona dynamics [98]. Nanoparticle size also seems to correlate inversely with the protein corona, not only in terms of composition but also in protein amount, due to a curvature effect [99]. Nonetheless, Ashby et al. evidenced for the first time that a soft corona is much less influential in IONP endocytosis than a hard corona [98].",

            "text": "The formation of a protein corona on the nanoparticle surface can be regulated by modifying the nanoparticle surface with zwitterions, polyethylene glycol (PEG), carbohydrate moieties, and dysopsonic proteins, which can enhance the colloidal stability and prolong the circulation time in blood by enabling escape from MPS clearance [14][15][16][17] . However, these strategies are still limited at conferring targeting specificity since an additional targeting ligand increases the propensity for protein corona formation to mask the targeting ability and inhibit the biological effects of nanoparticles [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] . This can explain why many nanoparticles with active targeting systems have failed in clinical trials 25 . Therefore, to design nanoparticle-based therapeutic agents, there is a considerable need to regulate protein corona formation on nanoparticles [26][27][28] and to obtain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in regulating nanoparticle-biological interactions. Here, we present a targeting system in which nanoparticles are supramolecularly precoated with a protein corona shield (PCS) that reduce serum protein absorption while retaining targeting specificity (Fig. 1a).",

Their sizes, structures, and chemical properties allow for the exploration of a vast range of potential applications and novel approaches in basic research. Biomedical applications, such as drug or gene delivery, often require the release of nanoparticles into the bloodstream, which is populated by blood cells and a plethora of small peptides, proteins, sugars, lipids, and complexes of all these molecules. Generally, in biological fluids, a nanoparticle\u2019s surface is covered by different biomolecules, which regulate the interactions of nanoparticles with tissues and, eventually, their fate. The adsorption of molecules onto the nanomaterial is described as \u201ccorona\u201d formation. Every blood particulate component can contribute to the creation of the corona, although small proteins represent the majority of the adsorbed chemical moieties. The precise rules of surface-protein adsorption remain unknown, although the surface charge and topography of the nanoparticle seem to discriminate the different coronas. We will describe examples of adsorption of specific biomolecules onto nanoparticles as one of the methods for natural surface functionalization, and highlight advantages and limitations. Our critical review of these topics may help to design appropriate nanomaterials for specific drug delivery.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles. The delivery approach that is both most widely used and most clinically advanced is to complex anionic oligonucleotides with cationic lipids thus forming lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (161)(162)(163). This approach has been especially important for therapeutic use of siRNA (164) and good accounts of current clinical trials using siRNA LNPs are found in recent reviews (10,165). In addition to the cationic lipid, LNPs typically include a neutral lipid such as cholesterol, but a variety of compositions are possible. While simple LNPs are effective as cell culture transfection agents, they cannot be used in vivo because extensive interactions with opsonic proteins in blood lead to rapid clearance by RES phagocytes. LNPs for in vivo use are usually 100-200 nm in size and include a surface coating of a neutral polymer such as PEG to minimize protein binding and uptake by RES cells. This allows greater persistence in the circulation and the opportunity to interact with other cell types. However, because of their size, LNPs can only exit the circulation at sites where the endothelial barrier is fenestrated, particularly liver, spleen and certain tumors having a high EPR effect. Because of this, much of the work with siRNA-LNPs has focused on liver diseases including transthyrethrin-mediated amyloidosis, clotting disorders, liver cancer and disorders of lipid metabolism (11,166). \n\nThe action of LNPs involves initial uptake by endocytosis. In some cases this is mediated by the binding of apolipoprotein E and interaction with the LDL receptor (167). Once in endosomes, the cationic lipids of the LNP interact with anionic membrane lipids to disrupt membrane structure through the formation of a non-bilayer lipid phase termed inverted hexagonal (H II ). This leads both to increased membrane permeability and to dissolution of the LNP and is the basis for conveying the oligonucleotide to the cytosol (168).",

In this review, we will mainly focus on gold nanoparticles. In the first part, we will discuss the fate of these particles once in a biological medium, especially in terms of size, and the protein composition of the corona. We will highlight the parameters influencing the quantity and the identity of the adsorbed proteins. In a second part, we will resume the main findings about the influence of a biomolecular corona on cellular uptake, toxicity, biodistribution and targeting ability. To be noticed is the need for standardized experiments and very precise reports of the protocols and methods used in the experimental sections to extract informative data. Given the biological consequences of this corona, we suggest that it should be taken into account in theoretical studies dealing with nanomaterials to better represent the biological environment.",

            "text": "LNPs also facilitate mRNA delivery to the spleen via a \u03b22-GPI-mediated endogenous targeting mechanism [116,194]. However, a recent study assessed the changes of protein coronas on mRNA-LNP surface accumulated in spleen after repeated administration, and the result was the enrichment of immunoglobulins [188]. It suggests that immunoglobulins also play an important role in the protein coronas on spleen-targeting LNP surface. Whether the protein coronas act together or promote spleen targeting independently remains inconclusive. Negative charge on LNP surface increased the spleen targeting ability of LNPs. Kranz et al. [41] used DOTMA (cationic lipid) and DOPE (helper lipid) to form mRNA-Lipoprotein X (LpX)s. It was observed that mRNA-LpXs with a zeta potential around \u2212 35 mV generated a signal exclusively in the spleen, with no significant expression observed in the liver. LoPresti et al. \n\n[141] used phosphatidylserine as helper lipids, maintaining a four-component LNP system. The surface of these mRNA-LNPs displayed a weak negative surface charge, thus reproducing the same spleen tropism. \n\nFurthermore, the structures of ionizable lipids affect the protein expression of mRNA in the spleen. Fenton et al. developed an ionizable lipid OF-Deg-Lin containing biodegradable ester bonds (Fig. 12B) [189,196]. Although the mRNA-LNPs composed of OF-Deg-Lin accumulated stronger in the liver than in the spleen, the mRNA  [192] expression in the spleen was over 85% while being hardly expressed in the liver. The reason might be that the ester bond degraded quickly in the liver before inducing protein expression in the hepatocytes (e.g., during cell internalization). Conversely, OF-Deg-Lin-LNPs might have been preserved in the spleen, retaining their ability to generate functional protein expression following uptake in the resident splenic cells.",

            "text": "To elucidate why liposomal LNP mRNA systems exhibit longer circulation lifetimes, we characterized the biomolecular corona (BMC) adsorbing to the surface of the different LNP systems following incubation with mouse plasma. Using size-exclusion column chromatography (SEC), isolation of the plasma protein-bound LNPs was performed (Fig. S14). A ~2-fold higher (wt/wt) adsorption of plasma proteins was found for LNP with the Onpattro-like lipid composition as compared to the liposomal LNP system (Fig. 3A). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis suggested both formulations exhibited a broadly similar plasma protein profile (Fig. 3B, Table S4). Liposomal LNP formulations with other ionizable lipids such as ALC-0315 and SM-102 also showed a decrease in protein adsorption after SEC (Fig. S15). Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis detected over 1000 different proteins in the BMC of both formulations (Fig. 3C). Volcano plot analysis showed 98 proteins that are statistically different (P value = 0.01) between the two formulations. Notably, the liposomal LNP exhibit significantly lower immunoglobulin heavy variable 10-1 (Ighv10-1) and fibrinogen (Fgb) levels (Fig. S16). The classes of proteins adsorbed by liposomal LNP and Onpattro-like systems were similar but with a slight reduction in immunoproteins (~4.4% less) and a slight increase in apolipoprotein (~3.6% more) for the liposomal LNP as shown in Fig. 3D and Table S4 [21][22][23] . While the dominant contribution to prolonged circulation lifetimes correlates with the overall reduction in adsorbed plasma proteins, it is possible that the reduced levels of immune proteins and increased levels of apolipoproteins could also contribute to this effect.",

            "text": "Thus, ultimately, it would be important to perform similar studies on the in vivo cell uptake of nanoparticles in conjunction with protein corona analysis on nanoparticles recovered following injection in animal models. \n\nAs a first step, here, the corona-coated nanoparticles formed in full human plasma were isolated by repeated centrifugations and washes, following standard procedures to remove all unbound and loosely bound proteins. Control experiments confirmed that proteins did not pellet when full human plasma was centrifuged using the same procedure (Supporting Figure S2). Thus, prior to exposure to cells, the dispersions of the isolated corona-coated nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements (see Figure S3, Supporting Information, for details). It was previously shown that silica nanoparticle morphology is not affected upon corona formation, 11 a part of the expected increase in average size, as we observed. DLS results showed that the isolated corona-coated nanoparticles were well redispersed and had a slight increase in average size in comparison to the bare nanoparticles in PBS (see Figure S3, Supporting Information), as expected upon protein adsorption and corona formation. For all nanoparticles, including the amino-modified nanoparticles, a negative zeta potential was measured for the dispersions in PBS. In fact, the zeta potential of both the 100 and 200 nm amino-modified nanoparticles is positive only at a pH lower than 7.4 (data from the manufacturer, not shown). \n\nAs a next step, the proteins in the different coronas were separated by SDS-PAGE in order to compare their composition. Different bands were observed for each nanoparticle, confirming that they adsorbed different types of proteins on their surface (Figure 1a and 1b, also Figure S4, Supporting Information, for protein corona on nanoparticles incubated in different concentrations of human plasma). Additionally, band intensities also differed, suggesting that for common corona proteins the absolute protein amounts also differed. Next, the hard corona proteins in each sample were identified by mass spectrometry (Figure 1c\u2212e and the complete results in the Supporting Information).",

            "text": "This is especially true when particles in the range 3-50 nm are compared to particles over 100 nm in diameter [15,16]. Therefore, smaller (9.5 nm) silica particles were also analyzed in the four different blood solutions, the experiment setup resulted in a difference of a factor of ~4 times more particle surface area in the samples compared to the 76 nm particles. The result is shown in Fig 2 . In a similar manner as for the 76 nm silica particles, there are clear differences in the formed coronas for the 9.5 nm particles. An overlay of the formed protein corona on the 9.5 and 76 nm silica particles in plasma, shown in Fig 3, reveals that particle size is important for the corona composition. Another striking difference is the lack of a pronounced Apolipoprotein A-I band for the 9.5 nm silica particles in whole blood. \n\nThe particle size influence on the formed protein corona was further explored by determining the formed protein corona around 13 and 23 nm silica particles. For both particles the surface area was the same as for the 9.5 nm particles, i.e. ~4 times more than the 76 nm particles. The gel in Figure B in S1 File shows the detected coronas around 13 and 23 nm silica nanoparticles. The detected coronas for the whole blood samples resembles more the 76 nm sample, with a pronounced apolipoprotein A-I band, than the 9.5 nm sample (even though they are much closer in size to the 9.5 nm particle). In serum, the detected coronas can be seen as a transition from the 9.5 to the 76 nm nanoparticle corona, with a decrease of the amount of detected apolipoprotein A-I with increasing size of the particle. This is probably an effect of the change in curvature/size of the nanoparticles. However, the really interesting data are the coronas for the whole blood with EDTA and plasma samples. The amount of detected protein from whole blood with EDTA for the 13 and 23 nm particles is lower than for the 9.5 nm particles, indicating a relatively sharp cutoff for maximum apolipoprotein A-I binding.",

            "text": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are interesting tools for a variety of applications for diagnosis and therapy in medicine [1,2]. Prominent examples are magnetic drug targeting [3,4], magnetic particle hyperthermia [5,6] or magnetic particle imaging [7,8]. For this purpose, aqueous MNP dispersions (ferrofluids) have to be administered to the body, which requires a reliable sterilization of the ferrofluids to exclude any risk for the patient from pathogens within the fluid. Typically, this sterilization is performed by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation or autoclaving [9]. \n\nWhen injecting MNP into a biological system (e.g., the peripheral blood of a patient), a layer made of different proteins present in the biological system (serving as a protein source) is formed on the surface of the MNP-the so-called protein corona [10,11]. This protein layer of a few nanometers [12] can be divided into a peripheral soft corona and a hard corona on the interface to the particles [13,14]. In our previous investigations [15,16] we could demonstrate that the formation of the corona occurs within seconds and the corona composition is furthermore influenced by the temperature at which corona formation takes place, as well as the duration of particle-protein interaction. It should be recalled here that for most engineered nanoparticles, their dilution in biological fluids (such as peripheral blood or fetal bovine serum) leads to particle aggregation [17][18][19]. It is also known that different particle properties (e.g., size and surface charge) exhibit an influence on protein corona formation and the resulting corona composition [20][21][22]. Furthermore, the protein corona plays a crucial role for the biological fate of the particles within the body [22][23][24]. The protein corona affects the cellular uptake profoundly and has an impact on the cell response, for example, cytotoxicity [25][26][27][28].",

            "text": "Cholesterol is a natural component of cell membranes and plays an important role in reducing the transfer temperature of LNPs, facilitating the transfer from the layered phase to the hexagonal phase, helping integrate these lipid nanoparticles with the endosome, and finally releasing mRNA from the LNPs internalized into the cytosol [61]. Cell cholesterol shows little solubility in the nanoparticle core, so it may accumulate crystalline on the surface of LNPs, causing lipid bilayer instability and increasing endosomal escape. In addition, it has a strong membrane fusion ability that is responsible for the intracellular uptake of mRNA and cytoplasmic entry [61]. Cholesterol is also a particle stabilizer in LNP formulations that limits nonspecific LNP protein interactions. It improves fat packaging and modulates the membrane fluidity and permeability of the bilayer membrane system through a condensing effect. Cholesterol also increases the ability of the phospholipid membrane to form a bicontinuous cubic phase at physiological temperatures by mixing with unsaturated phospholipids in a fat transfer system, thereby further increasing melting [36,44,59,61,64,67]. The purpose of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA systems is determined by reaching the target tissues because the target cells must then be internalized, and finally, the mRNA molecules must produce the necessary proteins which must escape the endosomes to reach the cytoplasm somewhere where translation happens [60]. The details of lipid nanoparticle delivery systems for mRNA-based vaccines are noted in Table 2.",

            "text": "Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for Atherosclerotic Plaques Targeting One of the therapeutic approaches in the management of chronic inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis is using immune modulators, such as methotrexate, which is reported to control the released proinflammatory cytokines [258]. The preparation of methotrexate as solid-lipid NPs (SLNs) was demonstrated to reduce the production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 proinflammatory cytokines significantly following the incubation with J774.A1 macrophages compared to the free drug [231]. It was demonstrated that the injection of amiodarone-loaded LNPs as an immune modulator enhanced the therapeutic activity and reduced the toxicity in rat models [246]. \n\nIt should be noted that the understanding of the protein corona, a layer surrounding the NP, is crucial for designing a safe and efficient atherosclerosis treatment. The corona's composition can affect the NP interaction and drug-release profiles; therefore, it could interfere with the therapeutic efficacy [259]. New strategies like zwitterionic coatings and controlling corona structure can reduce protein corona's obstructive effect in drug targeting and release [260]. Moreover, the conjugation of PEG on the outer surface of designed NPs is an additional strategy that is reported to reduce the effect of protein corona adhesion [261].",

            "text": "One key biological interaction is protein fouling, or protein corona formation, where proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface upon exposure to serum. This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have emerged as an effective nonviral delivery system for nucleic acid payloads due to their high encapsulation efficiency, low toxicity, ability to facilitate intracellular delivery, and the possibility to modulate their size and surface properties (1)(2)(3). The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

            "text": "To further investigate the protein corona composition, proteins are typically separated and desorbed from purified protein-nanoparticle complexes. We utilized the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method by cutting protein gel bands and then performing protein sequencing using LC-MS/MS, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of PCs (Figure 3). The current mechanisms underlying how the protein corona affects cell metabolism are not yet clear. It is known that proteins in the corona on nanoparticles can interact with other biomolecules inside and outside the cells. The intracellular protein corona regulates the macrophage phenotype and induces stress responses in endothelial cells. We believe that intercellular proteins replace some proteins from the surface of nanoparticles, disrupting protein homeostasis, subsequently triggering the \"Neutrophil activation involved in immune response\", \"Respiratory vesicle lumen\", \"Cytoplasmic vesicle lumen\", and \"Secretory granule lumen\" pathways (Figure 4). The PC-induced neutrophils impact the cellular clearance pathways of nanoparticles and alter cell metabolism. Currently, the targeted delivery of nanomedicines still presents significant challenges. Research by Wilhelm et al. has shown that only 0.7% of nanomaterials can be effectively transported to specific target sites [25]. Ideally, drugs should be enriched in target organs while minimizing accumulation in other tissues. However, in most cases, the formation of the protein corona weakens the targeting ability of nanomaterials. This is because the PC covers the surface of the nanomaterial carrying ligands, creating a barrier between the ligands and target cells, impeding their mutual recognition and reducing targeting efficiency. Therefore, in the follow-up experiments, we will knock out or inhibit proteins such as F-actin, Coronin, vATPase, TUBA, TUBB, MHCII, and TSP to elucidate the impact of these protein coronas on the mechanism of cellular phagocytosis.",

The protein corona on the NP surface is hypothesised to hinder interactions of nanoparticle ligands and the targets on the cell surface [44,47]. \n\nThe study of Mirshafiee et al. [44] found that the protein corona formed on BCN-NPs (NPs functionalized with bicyclononyne) incubated in medium with 10% serum and 100% serum consisted of abundant proteins, such as chain A, a novel allosteric mechanism in haemoglobin, fetuin, haemoglobin foetal subunit beta or apolipoprotein A-II precursor. It was also reported that \u226588% of proteins in BCN-NP coronas had a molecular weight below 30 kDa. Even relatively low molecular weight proteins created corona that significantly reduced NP targeting efficiency [44]. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (HiPco\u00ae) were also found to interact with cell culture medium and its components. Casey et al. described that SWCNT interacted with the medium via physisorption through van der Waals forces [26,48]. \n\nThe process of protein corona formation has a decisive influence on nanoparticle-induced toxicity. For example, silica nanoparticles (AmSil30) precoated with human plasma caused lower cell-death induction in primary human endothelial cells and microvascular endothelial cell line (ISO-HAS1). The resulting effect was dependent on the time of corona formation. The most significant effect was recorded for the early corona, but prolonged incubation with plasma (>30 min) did not counteract membered toxicity [49]. In another example, thrombocytes were used to study the protein corona effect on the biological model. In the latter study, nanoparticles exposed to human plasma for 0.5 min did not activate thrombocytes to form aggregates due to the presence of the plasma protein corona [49].",

            "text": "The typical structure of LNPs comprises four essential components: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids. [9,64] These components confer distinct advantages to LNPs in delivering nucleic acid drugs. The nucleic acid component of these drugs is negatively charged, while the ionizable cationic lipids, a critical component of LNPs, feature a positively charged hydrophilic amino head in acidic environments. This allows for the encapsulation of nucleic acids within the lipid nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. In a neutral plasma environment, these lipids are uncharged, thus avoiding uptake by monocyte macrophages, reducing toxicity, and finally becoming endosomes for release into the cytoplasm through megacellular drinking. [65] Among them, the key to improve the delivery efficiency is the release of LNPs from endosomes, i.e., the efficiency of endosome escape. The mechanism of endosomal escape is closely related to ionizable cationic lipids. One theory hypothesizes that cationic lipids interact with anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane to form a non-bilayer structure and disrupt the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing nucleic acids. [66] In contrast, another hypothesis suggests that the delivery efficiency of cationic lipids can be attributed to the pro-ton sponge phenomenon, in which buffering cationic polymers bind protons in the endosomes and activate the endosomal proton pump, allowing chloride ions to enter the endosomes along with the protons, elevating the osmotic pressure and causing the endosomes to swell and rupture. [67] However, the inefficiency of endosomal escape and the unidentified mechanism still make it a rate-limiting step in the delivery of LNPs. [68] PEGylated lipids prevent the aggregation of LNPs, while phospholipids contribute to nanoparticle formation. Cholesterol enhances the stability of nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles and promotes their fusion with cellular membranes. [9,69,70]",

            "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

            "text": "Identification of all corona components, for instance by proteomics, is the very first step toward understanding nanoparticle corona interactions with cell receptors. Then, the next step is to identify which actual components of the biomolecular corona are responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake (Figure 2A). Dissecting the biomolecular corona could be extremely challenging, given the high complexity of this layer. However, in recent years, a straightforward approach has been developed to make this possible. The idea was based on using a library consisting of nanoparticles with various physicochemical properties to tune the corona composition and then associating the abundance of certain corona proteins with the nanoparticle cellular uptake efficiency. One way to do it is by applying quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict nanoparticle-cell association as introduced by Walkey et al. (2014). To this end, a combination of biophysical, biological, and bioinformatic methods is required, as illustrated in Figure 3. The study showed that, by using a library containing more than 100 nanoparticle formulations and measuring their uptake by cells, this approach enabled the identification of 39 proteins classified as promoters, e.g., \u03b1-1 microglobulin and hyaluronanbinding protein 2, and of 25 inhibitors of cell association, e.g. complement C3. Similarly, Palchetti et al. (2016) used this approach to predict cell association of 16 lipid nanoparticles. \n\nInterestingly, they showed that only 8 protein corona fingerprints were shown to be the most important stimulators of nanoparticle uptake in HeLa cells. In another study, similar approaches were used to identify liposomal formulations with a corona fingerprint that allowed increased uptake in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (Palchetti et al., 2019).",

One is to pretreat animals with drugs that block the liver from taking up LNPs 7 or reduce the activity of mRNA once it reaches hepatocytes. 8,9 A second is to add active targeting ligands to nanoparticles. 10 For example, mRNA-loaded LNPs were targeted to Ly6c + leukocytes utilizing antibodies that were anchored into the lipid membrane. 11 In another example, plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein-targeting LNPs were covalently conjugated with antibodies, which increased lung protein expression. 12 A third approach is to change the chemical composition of the LNP. Clinical LNPs have consisted of four components: an ionizable or cationic lipid, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid, a cholesterol, and a helper lipid. For example, when a cationic helper lipid was added to a liver-targeting LNP, it was redirected to lung endothelial cells. 13 In another example, RNA-lipoplexes were targeted to lymphoid-resident dendritic cells by titrating negative charge. 14 Finally, a fifth charged molecule was added to the LNP, improving tropism to the spleen and lung. 15 Notably, authors subsequently reported that these LNPs can bind different serum proteins, providing an insight into the biology of delivery. 16 These studies led us to hypothesize that changing the helper lipid could affect the internal cellular response to LNPs in vivo. \n\nWe first confirmed helper lipid-dependent tropism. We used a functional in vivo mRNA and DNA barcode system 17\u221220 to evaluate how 18 helper lipids affected tropism to 19 cell types in vivo.",

            "text": "Serum albumin (SA) has a broad perspective in the creation of bionanoconjugates with nanoparticles for the regulation of the protein assembly into fibrils and the disaggregation of preformed fibrils [14], as well as being an ideal candidate for nanoparticle formulation as potential controlled-release drug delivery systems [15]. In addition, SA has been used for surface coating and passivation in biological liquids [16,17] and as biosurfactants [18]. In turn, SA is used as a sensor of conformational changes when interacting with surfaces of various natures [19]. Such a range of possible applications of albumin is due to both the availability and cheapness of SAs and the relative completeness of knowledge [16,20,21] of their conformational state, intermolecular interaction, colloidal stability [22], and phase behavior in dispersions with different microenvironments. \n\nWhen the biological environment interacts with the surface, colloidal nanomaterials, nanoparticles, a dynamic coating of biomolecules, and proteins spontaneously arise around them, called the protein corona [19,23,24] (Figure 1). Irreversible or at least long-term binding of a protein by a nanoparticle leads to the formation of a \"hard corona\", whereas the rapidly reversible binding of a protein that has a higher turnover rate results in the formation of a \"soft corona\". The prospects for the wide use of nanoparticles in biomedicine [1,3] suggest the need to study this phenomenon since the toxicity of nanomaterials and the nanorisks of their use largely depend on the functioning of the corona. Blood plasma proteins, and in particular albumins, are the most important components in the formation of the protein corona, although the mechanism of its formation is complex and insufficiently studied [25], being a phase-regulating process. \n\nHighly organized protein molecules are edited by evolution to perform specific functions. However, other supramolecular structures and nanoparticles have been intensively introduced into living systems for possible adjustment of these functions.",

            "text": "The question about the significance (and role) of a protein corona on different classes of nanoparticles cannot be answered in a \"general sense\". This is not due to an inherent issue with the nanodimensions of the particles. Instead, it arises from the nature of the nanosystem (nanoparticles and plasma proteins, forming a mixed colloidal system) having an especially large surface area. Thus the system is -to some extend-instable [7,9,74] and the deposition of some plasma proteins -with time-on the nanoparticles is \"likely\". As a result, the popular assertion that any nanoparticle forms a protein corona upon contact with blood plasma is generally true for nearly all nanoparticles. However, some nanoparticles designed for nanomedicine applications do not absorb any proteins and, therefore, do not form a protein corona. This occurs for well-understood reasons: the cores of these nanoparticles are coated with a dense layer of strongly hydrated, hydrophilic polymers, which effectively keep plasma proteins away. This is achieved through a combination of a bound water layer and entropic shielding. \n\nThe next question is: How important is the formation of a protein corona. Now, corona formation can be studied, and the results provides certain insights into highly complex systems. Work on this topic accounts for about 1.500 publications up to the middle of 2022. [7] It excludes, however, mostly the question, if corona formation is unavoidable. In our opinion, the real significance of corona formation has to come, however, from the interest to use nanoparticles in the broad field of nanomedicine. And here, the formation of a protein corona -at least in cases, when corona formation is strong-is disadvantageous. That is because nanomedicine wants to use nanoparticles in patients differing -to a certain extend-in serum protein composition. A central idea is thereby to decouple the pharmacological action of an active compound from its body distribution (e.g., to bring drugs into a tumor, or to bring an antigen and adjuvant to immune cells in the skin, spleen or lymph nodes.",

The presence of the corona enveloping the nanoparticle strongly affects the interplay with immune cells. The immune responses mediated by protein corona can affect nanoparticle toxicity and targeting capabilities. But the intracellular signaling of LNPs after corona formation resulting in the change of nanoparticles' ability to provoke immune responses remains unclear. Therefore, a more systematic and delineated approach must be considered to present the correlation between corona complexes and the shift in nanoparticle immunogenicity. Here, we studied and reported the inhibiting effect of the absorbed proteins on the LNPs on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a key intracellular protein complex that modulates several inflammatory responses. Ionizable lipid as a component of LNP was observed to play an important role in modulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in serum-free conditions. However, in the presence of serum proteins, the corona layer on LNPs caused a significant reduction in the inflammasome activation. Reduction in the lysosomal rupture after treatment with corona-LNPs significantly reduced inflammasome activation. Furthermore, a strong reduction of cellular uptake in macrophages after the corona formation was observed. On inspecting the uptake mechanisms in macrophages using transport inhibitors, lipid formulation was found to play a critical role in determining the endocytic pathways for the LNPs in macrophages. This study highlights the need to critically analyze the protein interactions with nanomaterials and their concomitant adaptability with immune cells to evaluate nano-bio surfaces and successfully design nanomaterials for biological applications.",

Such protein\u2013nanoparticle interactions are often initially studied using in vitro cellular models aiming to eventually understand biodistribution and cargo delivery efficiency of the LNPs in vivo.

Cellular uptake and siRNA delivery efficiency of the LNPs were determined in media containing untreated or heat-inactivated serum. Mechanistically, we found that apolipoprotein E, a protein corona component that is crucial for MC3 LNP tropism, displayed reduced stability and functionality upon heat inactivation of FCS, thereby negatively influencing uptake and cargo delivery of MC3 LNPs, but not C12 LNPs.

            "abstract": "\n \n Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the presence of chromosomal rearrangements that result in novel fusion-oncoproteins. Since fusion genes both initiate and maintain leukemia, they are cancer-specific therapeutic targets that are expressed in every single leukemic cell. We have developed a therapeutic siRNA approach by designing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the in vivo delivery of siRNAs to AML cells (Issa et al, 2023; Swart et al, 2023). We have now extended this approach to t(6;11)-positive AML that is associated with a dismal outcome in pediatric and adult AML. This translocation fuses the KMT2A (MLL) gene with the AFDN (AF6) gene, resulting in the dysregulation of the RAS pathway, aberrant gene expression and impaired differentiation.\n Here, we tested both an unmodified and a fully modified, 21-23 nucleotide, overhang siRNAs that successfully targets the KMT2A::AFDN gene fusion in AML cell lines and t(6;11) primary cells. Four different LNP formulations were tested, with changes both in lipid composition and molar ratios, to optimize knockdown efficiency. First, we assessed the delivery and knockdown efficiency using the Onpattro (Patisiran) LNP formulation, which consists of DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG2000 at the molar ratios 50:10:38.5:1.5, respectively. Second, we utilized a LNP formulation where the cholesterol helper lipid was substituted with a naturally occurring phytosterol, namely \u03b2-sitosterol, at the same molar ratio as the standard formulation. Third, we tested an LNP formulation consisting of DLin-MC3-DMA, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and DSPC with molar ratios of 50:20:20:10. Lastly, we also tested a novel LNP formulation, which incorporates DLin-MC3-DMA, \u03b2-sitosterol, sphingomyelin and polysarcosine.\n Here, a 85% and 82% knockdown for the standard formulation, a 74% and 80% knockdown for the \u03b2-sitosterol formulation, a 76% and a 77% knockdown for the sphingomyelin formulation and a 83% and a 76% knockdown for the novel formulation were observed at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/ml in SHI-1 cells over 48 hours when comparing the unmodified and modified siRNAs, respectively. These data indicates that knockdown efficacies are similar, while the fully modified siRNA only confers marginal increases in knockdown efficiency. As such, the choice of the optimal LNP for the treatment of AML will then depend on the pharmacokinetics and the ability of the LNPs to accumulate in the bone marrow in vivo.\n Additionally, the formation of the biomolecular protein corona upon serum exposure is an important factor mediating LNP efficiency. Serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs can facilitate LNP uptake and endosomal escape. We assessed both the association of LNPs encapsulating a cy5-labelled siRNA with SHI-1 and ML-2 cells in serum and in serum-free conditions using flow cytometry, and the knockdown efficiency. Both uptake of LNPs and knockdown were severely diminished over time in serum free conditions, and only 20% knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN was observed, suggesting that the protein corona facilitates LNP mode of action.\n To investigate whether our LNP-based siRNA delivery system targeting KMT2A::AFDN confers a functional effect on downstream targets, we assessed the expression of SHARP1. SHARP1 binds to transcriptionally active chromatin and activates gene expression critical for cell survival. Furthermore, SHARP1 cooperates with KMT2A::AFDN to regulate gene expression crucial for leukemogenesis, and mediates colony formation. Indeed, we report a 50% knockdown of SHARP1 in response to KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, while observing a 2-fold decrease in colony formation of SHI-1 cells. In addition, we assessed the expression of surface markers. Here, the expression of CD117 was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which indicates a shift to a more mature phenotype.\n Taken together, we successfully induced knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN in AML using different formulations of LNPs, a process which is mediated by the protein corona. We also gain insights into the downstream targeting of KMT2A::AFDN, where SHARP1 is downregulated upon KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is mediated through the loss of DOT1L activity. Furthermore, the colony formation was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is in line with the loss of SHARP1. As such, the knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN with LNPs shows great potential in the treatment of t(6;11) AML.\n",

We have developed a therapeutic siRNA approach by designing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the in vivo delivery of siRNAs to AML cells (Issa et al, 2023; Swart et al, 2023). We have now extended this approach to t(6;11)-positive AML that is associated with a dismal outcome in pediatric and adult AML. This translocation fuses the KMT2A (MLL) gene with the AFDN (AF6) gene, resulting in the dysregulation of the RAS pathway, aberrant gene expression and impaired differentiation.\n Here, we tested both an unmodified and a fully modified, 21-23 nucleotide, overhang siRNAs that successfully targets the KMT2A::AFDN gene fusion in AML cell lines and t(6;11) primary cells. Four different LNP formulations were tested, with changes both in lipid composition and molar ratios, to optimize knockdown efficiency. First, we assessed the delivery and knockdown efficiency using the Onpattro (Patisiran) LNP formulation, which consists of DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG2000 at the molar ratios 50:10:38.5:1.5, respectively. Second, we utilized a LNP formulation where the cholesterol helper lipid was substituted with a naturally occurring phytosterol, namely \u03b2-sitosterol, at the same molar ratio as the standard formulation. Third, we tested an LNP formulation consisting of DLin-MC3-DMA, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and DSPC with molar ratios of 50:20:20:10. Lastly, we also tested a novel LNP formulation, which incorporates DLin-MC3-DMA, \u03b2-sitosterol, sphingomyelin and polysarcosine.\n Here, a 85% and 82% knockdown for the standard formulation, a 74% and 80% knockdown for the \u03b2-sitosterol formulation, a 76% and a 77% knockdown for the sphingomyelin formulation and a 83% and a 76% knockdown for the novel formulation were observed at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/ml in SHI-1 cells over 48 hours when comparing the unmodified and modified siRNAs, respectively. These data indicates that knockdown efficacies are similar, while the fully modified siRNA only confers marginal increases in knockdown efficiency. As such, the choice of the optimal LNP for the treatment of AML will then depend on the pharmacokinetics and the ability of the LNPs to accumulate in the bone marrow in vivo.\n Additionally, the formation of the biomolecular protein corona upon serum exposure is an important factor mediating LNP efficiency. Serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs can facilitate LNP uptake and endosomal escape. We assessed both the association of LNPs encapsulating a cy5-labelled siRNA with SHI-1 and ML-2 cells in serum and in serum-free conditions using flow cytometry, and the knockdown efficiency. Both uptake of LNPs and knockdown were severely diminished over time in serum free conditions, and only 20% knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN was observed, suggesting that the protein corona facilitates LNP mode of action.\n To investigate whether our LNP-based siRNA delivery system targeting KMT2A::AFDN confers a functional effect on downstream targets, we assessed the expression of SHARP1. SHARP1 binds to transcriptionally active chromatin and activates gene expression critical for cell survival. Furthermore, SHARP1 cooperates with KMT2A::AFDN to regulate gene expression crucial for leukemogenesis, and mediates colony formation. Indeed, we report a 50% knockdown of SHARP1 in response to KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, while observing a 2-fold decrease in colony formation of SHI-1 cells. In addition, we assessed the expression of surface markers. Here, the expression of CD117 was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which indicates a shift to a more mature phenotype.\n Taken together, we successfully induced knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN in AML using different formulations of LNPs, a process which is mediated by the protein corona. We also gain insights into the downstream targeting of KMT2A::AFDN, where SHARP1 is downregulated upon KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is mediated through the loss of DOT1L activity. Furthermore, the colony formation was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is in line with the loss of SHARP1. As such, the knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN with LNPs shows great potential in the treatment of t(6;11) AML.\n",

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms.

The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity.

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation.",

To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity.

We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery.

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73)."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                    "[195696648 | Degors et al. | 2019 | Citations: 281]": "Conspectus Over the past decades, major efforts were undertaken to develop devices on a nanoscale level for the efficient and nontoxic delivery of molecules to tissues and cells, for the purpose of either diagnosis or treatment of disease. The application of such devices in drug delivery has proven to be beneficial for matters as diverse as drug solubility, drug targeting, controlled drug release, and transport of drugs across cellular barriers. Multiple nanotherapeutics have been approved for clinical treatment, and more products are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. However, many biological barriers hinder the medical application of nanocarriers. There are two main classes of barriers that need to be overcome by drug nanocarriers: extracellular and intracellular barriers, both of which may capture and/or destroy therapeutics before they reach their target site. This Account discusses major biological barriers that are confronted by nanotherapeutics, following their systemic administration, focusing on cellular entry and endosomal escape of gene delivery vectors. The use of pH-responsive materials to overcome the endosomal barrier is addressed. Historically, cell biologists have studied the interaction between cells and pathogens in order to unveil the mechanisms of endocytosis and cell signaling. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that cells may respond in similar ways to artificial drug delivery systems and, consequently, that knowledge on the cellular response against both pathogens and nanoparticulate systems will aid in the design of improved nanomedicine. A close collaboration between bioengineers and cell biologists will promote this development. At the same time, we have come to realize that tools that we use to study fundamental cellular processes, including metabolic inhibitors of endocytosis and overexpression/downregulation of proteins, may cause changes in cellular physiology. This calls for the implementation of refined methods to study nanocarrier\u2013cell interactions, as is discussed in this Account. Finally, recent papers on the dynamics of cargo release from endosomes by means of live cell imaging have significantly advanced our understanding of the transfection process. They have initiated discussion (among others) on the limited number of endosomal escape events in transfection, and on the endosomal stage at which genetic cargo is most efficiently released. Advancements in imaging techniques, including super-resolution microscopy, in concert with techniques to label endogenous proteins and/or label proteins with synthetic fluorophores, will contribute to a more detailed understanding of nanocarrier-cell dynamics, which is imperative for the development of safe and efficient nanomedicine.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the most successful RNA delivery systems. However, expanding their application hinges on the discovery of next generation LNPs with high potency, cyto-specific targeting, and low side effects. Overcoming the difficulty of releasing cargo from endocytosed LNPs remains a significant hurdle. The endosomal escape of viral and non-viral nanoparticles relies on the topological transformation of membrane fusion pore formation followed by RNA translocation into the cytosol. In this study we show that LNP-RNA nanostructure modulates the energetic cost of LNP fusion with a target membrane. The inclusion of a new class of structurally-active lipids leads to superior LNP endosomal fusion, fast evasion of endosomal entrapment, and efficacious RNA delivery. Specifically, bicontinuous cubic RNA-LNPs, cuboplexes, have significantly higher endosomal escape rates and deliver more RNA compared to regular lamellar LNPs.",

Release from monovalent[1,2-dioleoyl-3(1)-1(trimethylammonio)propane] or multivalent (dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine) lipids was quantified by an increase of ethidium bromide (EtBr) fluorescence. Plasmid sensitivity to DNAse I degradation was examined using changes in plasmid migration on agarose gel electrophoresis. Physical separation of the DNA from the cationic lipid was confirmed and quantified on sucrose density gradients. Anionic liposomes containing compositions that mimic the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer of the plasma membrane (e.g. phosphatidylserine) rapidly released DNA from the complex. Release occurred near a 1/1 charge ratio (-/+) and was unaffected by ionic strength or ion type. Water soluble molecules with a high negative linear charge density such as dextran sulfate or heparin also released DNA. However, ionic water soluble molecules such as ATP, tRNA, DNA, poly(glutamic acid), spermidine, spermine, or histone did not, even at 100-fold charge excess (-/+). On the basis of these results, we propose that after the cationic lipid/DNA complex is internalized into cells by endocytosis it destabilizes the endosomal membrane. Destabilization induces flip-flop of anionic lipids from the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer, which laterally diffuse into the complex and form a charge neutral ion pair with the cationic lipids. This results in displacement of the DNA from the cationic lipid and release of the DNA into cytoplasm. This mechanism accounts for a variety of observations on cationic lipid/DNA complex-cell interactions."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022).",

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

In mice, non-human primates, and humans, LNPs deliver RNA to hepatocytes by adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which binds low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). A growing number of LNPs can deliver RNA to nonhepatocytes, suggesting that ApoE- and LDLR-independent interactions could affect LNP tropism. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a universal DNA barcoding system that quantifies how chemically distinct LNPs deliver small interfering RNA in any mouse model, including genetic knockouts. We quantified how 98 different LNPs targeted 11 cell types in wildtype, LDLR-/-, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and ApoE-/- mice, studying how these genes, which traffic endogenous lipids, affected LNP delivery. These data identified a novel, stereopure LNP that targets Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes in an ApoE-independent manner. These results suggest that non-ApoE interactions can affect the tropism of LNP-RNA drugs.",

Recently, LNPs have delivered mRNA to non-hepatocytes in mice and non-human primates, suggesting they can target new cell types via ApoE- and LDLR-independent pathways. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how 60 LNPs delivered mRNA with cell type resolution in wild-type mice and three knockout mouse strains related to lipid trafficking: ApoE-/-, LDLR-/-, and PCSK9-/-. These data suggest that the hydrophobic tail length of diketopiperazine-based lipids can be changed to drive ApoE- and LDLR-independent delivery in vivo. More broadly, the results support the hypothesis that endogenous LNP trafficking can be tuned by modifying lipid chemistry."

The corona modifies key physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticle surfaces that modulate its biological and pharmacokinetic activity, biodistribution, and safety. In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

This will be in synthesis format to provide a coherent explanation of fundamental concepts.\n\n2. \"Formation Mechanisms of Biomolecular Corona\" - This section should explain the key mechanisms and processes by which LNPs interact with blood components to form the corona. Synthesis format is appropriate as we need to explain processes and interactions cohesively.\n\n3. \"Components and Structure of the Corona\" - This section should describe what proteins and blood components actually make up the corona and how they're structured (e.g., hard vs. soft corona). Synthesis format will allow for a comprehensive explanation of the corona composition.\n\n4. \"Factors Influencing Corona Formation\" - This section should cover what properties of LNPs and environmental conditions affect corona formation. Synthesis format is best to explain these relationships.\n\n5. \"Biological and Therapeutic Implications\" - This section should explain how the corona affects the behavior and efficacy of LNPs in biological systems. Synthesis format will enable a coherent explanation of these complex effects.\n\nNow I'll assign quotes to each dimension:",

                            "Abstract The surfaces of pristine nanoparticles become rapidly coated by proteins in biological fluids, forming the so-called protein corona. The corona modifies key physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticle surfaces that modulate its biological and pharmacokinetic activity, biodistribution, and safety. In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

                            "Abstract The surfaces of pristine nanoparticles become rapidly coated by proteins in biological fluids, forming the so-called protein corona. The corona modifies key physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticle surfaces that modulate its biological and pharmacokinetic activity, biodistribution, and safety. In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017)."

For instance, protein corona formation on the surface of nanoparticles can modify its physicochemical properties and interfere with its intended functionalities in the biological microenvironments. As such, much emphasis should be placed in understanding these complex phenomena that occur at the bio-nano interface. The main aim of this review is to present different factors that are influencing protein-nanoparticle interaction such as physicochemical properties of nanoparticle (i.e., size and size distribution, shape, composition, surface chemistry, and coatings) and the effect of biological microenvironments. Apart from that, the effect of ignored factors at the bio-nano interface such as temperature, plasma concentration, plasma gradient effect, administration route, and cell observer were also addressed."

Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (Xu et al., 1996)(Degors et al., 2019)(Zheng et al., 2022).

In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions (Monopoli et al., 2012)(Francia et al., 2019)(Albanese et al., 2014). Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76].

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity."

Here, we apply several different methodologies, in a time-resolved manner, to follow the lifetime of such biomolecular \"coronas\" both in situ and isolated from the excess plasma. We find that such particle-biomolecule complexes can be physically isolated from the surrounding medium and studied in some detail, without altering their structure. For several nanomaterial types, we find that blood plasma-derived coronas are sufficiently long-lived that they, rather than the nanomaterial surface, are likely to be what the cell sees. From fundamental science to regulatory safety, current efforts to classify the biological impacts of nanomaterials (currently according to bare material type and bare surface properties) may be assisted by the methodology and understanding reported here."

Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation."

The hard corona comprises proteins that bind almost irreversibly to the LNP surface with high affinity, potentially in either their native or denatured form <Paper corpusId=\"257252444\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Rioja et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"90881207\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This tightly bound layer primarily determines the nanoparticle's biological identity and subsequent physiological responses <Paper corpusId=\"90881207\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Surrounding the hard corona is a more dynamic \"soft\" corona, which constantly exchanges proteins with the surrounding environment <Paper corpusId=\"257252444\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Rioja et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Both layers are considered relevant in determining how LNPs interact with cells <Paper corpusId=\"257252444\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Rioja et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe composition of the protein corona is not random but depends on the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles and influences their biological activity <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. LNPs are known to interact with various opsonins in the blood, including immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and complement proteins, which can facilitate recognition and uptake by phagocytic cells, potentially leading to their elimination from circulation <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSpecific proteins within the corona play crucial roles in determining the biodistribution and cellular targeting of LNPs. Notably, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been identified as a critical component for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"271723470\" paperTitle=\"(Alhabib et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. ApoE binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticle surface and acts as a ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors expressed on hepatocytes, ensuring predominant accumulation in liver cells <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"249464961\" paperTitle=\"(Sanchez et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"254774422\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism has been confirmed by experimental data showing that LNPs incubated with ApoE preferentially target hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, other protein corona compositions can direct LNPs to different cell types. For example, LNPs with a protein corona primarily composed of albumin tend to distribute preferentially to Kupffer cells rather than hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These differential targeting effects demonstrate how the specific composition of the protein corona can influence tissue tropism and cellular uptake mechanisms.\n\nThe protein corona not only affects the tissue distribution of LNPs but can also be leveraged to enhance or direct the delivery of therapeutic cargo <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Indeed, LNPs fundamentally depend on protein corona formation to mediate their targeting capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"279032300\" paperTitle=\"(Straten et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Understanding and potentially controlling the composition of the biomolecular corona therefore represents a significant opportunity for improving the efficacy and specificity of LNP-based therapeutics.",

Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73)."

Unless they are specifically designed to avoid it, nanoparticles in contact with biological fluids are rapidly covered by a selected group of biomolecules to form a corona that interacts with biological systems. Here we review the basic concept of the nanoparticle corona and its structure and composition, and highlight how the properties of the corona may be linked to its biological impacts. We conclude with a critical assessment of the key problems that need to be resolved in the near future."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in (Dilliard et al., 2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022)."

                            "To predict whether preclinical lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery will translate in humans, it is necessary to understand whether the mechanism used by LNPs to enter cells is conserved across species. In mice, non-human primates, and humans, LNPs deliver RNA to hepatocytes by adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which binds low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). A growing number of LNPs can deliver RNA to nonhepatocytes, suggesting that ApoE- and LDLR-independent interactions could affect LNP tropism. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a universal DNA barcoding system that quantifies how chemically distinct LNPs deliver small interfering RNA in any mouse model, including genetic knockouts. We quantified how 98 different LNPs targeted 11 cell types in wildtype, LDLR-/-, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and ApoE-/- mice, studying how these genes, which traffic endogenous lipids, affected LNP delivery. These data identified a novel, stereopure LNP that targets Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes in an ApoE-independent manner. These results suggest that non-ApoE interactions can affect the tropism of LNP-RNA drugs."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have delivered therapeutic RNA to hepatocytes in humans. Adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto these clinical LNP-mRNA drugs has been shown to facilitate hepatocyte entry via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Since ApoE-LDLR trafficking is conserved in mice, non-human primates, and humans, characterizing this mechanism eased clinical transition. Recently, LNPs have delivered mRNA to non-hepatocytes in mice and non-human primates, suggesting they can target new cell types via ApoE- and LDLR-independent pathways. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how 60 LNPs delivered mRNA with cell type resolution in wild-type mice and three knockout mouse strains related to lipid trafficking: ApoE-/-, LDLR-/-, and PCSK9-/-. These data suggest that the hydrophobic tail length of diketopiperazine-based lipids can be changed to drive ApoE- and LDLR-independent delivery in vivo. More broadly, the results support the hypothesis that endogenous LNP trafficking can be tuned by modifying lipid chemistry."

Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies.

These factors collectively determine the composition and structure of the corona, which ultimately governs the biological identity and fate of LNPs in vivo. (8 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe formation of the biomolecular corona on LNPs is influenced by a complex interplay of factors related to both nanoparticle properties and biological environments. The physicochemical characteristics of LNPs, including their composition, charge, size, and surface chemistry, significantly impact which proteins adsorb to their surface and consequently determine their biological identity and in vivo fate <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Notably, the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in determining the protein corona composition, which directly affects the targeting capabilities of LNPs <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPEG shedding represents a critical factor in corona formation. When LNPs enter biological environments, the PEG layer that initially stabilizes them begins to shed, exposing the underlying lipid structure to serum proteins. This shedding process depends on several variables: the carbon chain length of the lipid conjugated to PEG, the concentration of serum proteins present, and the duration of exposure to these proteins <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have demonstrated that pre-incubation of PEGylated LNPs in serum increases their cellular uptake proportionally to both serum concentration and incubation time, suggesting that serum proteins actively stimulate PEG lipid release through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood <Paper corpusId=\"258076580\" paperTitle=\"(Gyanani et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe specific composition of the biological environment significantly influences corona formation. When LNPs encounter blood, they interact with various opsonins including immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and complement proteins, which can promote recognition and clearance by phagocytic cells <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. The resulting biomolecular corona may contain hundreds of different proteins and other biomolecules, whose specific composition is determined by the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe dynamic nature of the biological environment also plays a significant role in corona formation. Upon intravenous administration, LNPs rapidly adsorb serum proteins on their surface, creating a coating that fundamentally alters their biological identity <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257252444\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Rioja et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This adsorption process is not random but is influenced by the properties of both the nanoparticle and the surrounding biomolecules <Paper corpusId=\"257252444\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Rioja et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe design of LNPs can be strategically engineered to influence corona formation. For example, cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine components in LNPs trigger the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor <Paper corpusId=\"268238116\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This understanding has been exploited in the development of therapeutics like Onpattro\u00ae, whose success depends on the presence of ApoE in the corona for efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe resulting biomolecular corona can significantly impact therapeutic outcomes by potentially interfering with nanoparticle-cell interactions, inducing immune responses, and altering drug-release efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"254318207\" paperTitle=\"(Sartori et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Understanding these influencing factors is therefore crucial for designing LNPs with predictable in vivo behavior and optimized therapeutic efficacy.",

This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions (Monopoli et al., 2012)(Francia et al., 2019)(Albanese et al., 2014).

Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown."

                "text": "\nThe formation of biomolecular coronas on LNPs has profound implications for their therapeutic applications and biological interactions. When LNPs enter the bloodstream, the resulting protein coating fundamentally alters their surface properties, creating a new biological identity that determines their in vivo fate and significantly influences their therapeutic efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207559505\" paperTitle=\"(Albanese et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This altered identity can dramatically impact biodistribution patterns, cellular uptake mechanisms, and ultimately the therapeutic outcome of LNP-based treatments <Paper corpusId=\"268239296\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona plays a decisive role in determining the tissue tropism of LNPs, with specific corona compositions directing nanoparticles to different target tissues. Most prominently, the adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto LNPs enables hepatocyte targeting via binding to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), explaining the predominant liver accumulation observed with many LNP formulations <Paper corpusId=\"271723470\" paperTitle=\"(Alhabib et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism has been successfully exploited in clinical applications such as Onpattro\u00ae, whose efficacy stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona <Paper corpusId=\"220281961\" paperTitle=\"(Witzigmann et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, LNPs with coronas primarily composed of albumin tend to distribute preferentially to Kupffer cells rather than hepatocytes, demonstrating how corona composition can redirect tissue targeting <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent advances have revealed that the biomolecular corona can be strategically engineered to enhance targeting beyond the liver. The concept of \"endogenous targeting\" has emerged, wherein the molecular composition of nanoparticles is rationally designed to interact with specific proteins in the blood, enabling delivery to non-liver tissues <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach utilizes selective organ targeting (SORT) molecules whose chemical structure determines the LNP's tissue-specific activity by recruiting distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond targeting, the biomolecular corona can influence several other critical aspects of LNP functionality. For instance, protein corona formation can shift the pH sensitivity of LNPs, altering the onset of binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH values, which affects their endosomal escape capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"254658641\" paperTitle=\"(Aliakbarinodehi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the corona may interfere with nanoparticle-cell interactions, potentially inducing immune responses and modifying drug-release efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"254318207\" paperTitle=\"(Sartori et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe immune system's interaction with the protein corona represents another important consideration. LNPs can interact with various opsonins in the blood, including immunoglobulins and complement proteins, which may facilitate recognition and uptake by phagocytic cells, potentially leading to their elimination from circulation <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing LNPs with improved circulation times and reduced immunogenicity.\n\nThe dynamic nature of corona formation also has therapeutic implications. Initially, the corona contains considerable amounts of low-affinity but abundant proteins, which over time are enriched with high-affinity proteins <Paper corpusId=\"55245252\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9545400\" paperTitle=\"(Foroozandeh et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This evolution of corona composition can affect the timing and efficiency of therapeutic delivery.\n\nDespite its importance, studying the biomolecular corona of LNPs presents significant technical challenges due to difficulties in isolating LNPs and their associated coronas from complex biological media <Paper corpusId=\"268239296\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Overcoming these challenges is essential for fully understanding and leveraging corona effects in therapeutic applications.\n\nRecent research has revealed that cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine components in LNPs can trigger the formation of specific protein coronas that facilitate receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"268238116\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, studies have identified high-density lipoprotein (HDL) content in the corona as a potentially superior predictor of in vivo activity compared to the commonly used biomarker ApoE <Paper corpusId=\"275712592\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259353478\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe growing recognition that LNPs fundamentally depend on protein corona formation to mediate their targeting capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"279032300\" paperTitle=\"(Straten et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> underscores the importance of intentionally designing LNPs to form specific coronas. This strategic approach represents a significant opportunity for improving the efficacy and specificity of LNP-based therapeutics, potentially enabling precise targeting of diverse tissues and cell types beyond the current limitations.",

Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165]."

                            "A nanoparticle's physical and chemical properties at the time of cell contact will determine the ensuing cellular response. Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation."

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in (Dilliard et al., 2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022)."

An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics (Foroozandeh et al., 2015)(Caracciolo et al., 2017). At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017)."

For instance, protein corona formation on the surface of nanoparticles can modify its physicochemical properties and interfere with its intended functionalities in the biological microenvironments. As such, much emphasis should be placed in understanding these complex phenomena that occur at the bio-nano interface. The main aim of this review is to present different factors that are influencing protein-nanoparticle interaction such as physicochemical properties of nanoparticle (i.e., size and size distribution, shape, composition, surface chemistry, and coatings) and the effect of biological microenvironments. Apart from that, the effect of ignored factors at the bio-nano interface such as temperature, plasma concentration, plasma gradient effect, administration route, and cell observer were also addressed."

Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (Xu et al., 1996)(Degors et al., 2019)(Zheng et al., 2022).

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."
