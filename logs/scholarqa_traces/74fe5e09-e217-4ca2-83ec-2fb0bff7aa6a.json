The limitations of brain-targeting therapies and the unclear molecular mechanisms driving neurodegeneration hamper the possibility of developing successful treatment options. Thus, nanoscale drug delivery platforms offer a promising solution. This paper explores and compares lipidic nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and hybrid liposomal\u2013EV nanoplatforms as advanced approaches for targeted delivery to combat neurodegeneration. Lipidic nanoparticles are well-characterized platforms that allow multi-drug loading and scalable production. Conversely, EVs offer the ability of selectively targeting specific tissues and high biocompatibility. The combination of these two platforms in one could lead to promising results in the treatment of neurodegeneration. However, many issues, such as the regulatory framework, remain to be solved before these novel products are translated into clinical practice.",

Specifically, nanoparticle size and surface modifications can influence their retention time and subsequently the concentration of nanoparticles within microglia [31]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles exposed to biological fluids interact with plasma components, leading to the formation of a protein corona. The composition of this corona is also influenced by the physicochemical characteristics (i.e., lipid composition, size, \u03b6-potential, surface modifications) of the nanoparticles and depends on the biological environment in which they are dispersed. This modulation affects the physiological interactions of the nanoparticles in vivo, influencing pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and targeting Several techniques have been utilized to bypass the BBB, including invasive methods such as injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intracerebroventricular injection. However, neurosurgery poses high risks and has limited efficacy [27]. Nanoparticles, including lipid-based ones, can effectively enter the brain through the disruption of tight junctions and transcytosis, which is mediated by low-density lipoproteins, insulin, and transferrin receptors [28,29]. Lipid-based nanoparticles, upon entering the brain, interact with the microglial cell membrane through endocytosis. This process involves phagocytosis for larger particles and pinocytosis for smaller ones, which are further classified into clathrinmediated, caveolae-mediated, clathrin-and caveolae-independent, and micropinocytosis processes [30]. In addition to these active transport mechanisms, nanoparticles can also penetrate cells through passive diffusion. Their physicochemical properties can significantly affect microglial modulation. Specifically, nanoparticle size and surface modifications can influence their retention time and subsequently the concentration of nanoparticles within microglia [31]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles exposed to biological fluids interact with plasma components, leading to the formation of a protein corona.",

Mahairaki\n## Abstract\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, affect a wide variety of the population and pose significant challenges with progressive and irreversible neural cell loss. The limitations of brain-targeting therapies and the unclear molecular mechanisms driving neurodegeneration hamper the possibility of developing successful treatment options. Thus, nanoscale drug delivery platforms offer a promising solution. This paper explores and compares lipidic nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and hybrid liposomal\u2013EV nanoplatforms as advanced approaches for targeted delivery to combat neurodegeneration. Lipidic nanoparticles are well-characterized platforms that allow multi-drug loading and scalable production. Conversely, EVs offer the ability of selectively targeting specific tissues and high biocompatibility. The combination of these two platforms in one could lead to promising results in the treatment of neurodegeneration. However, many issues, such as the regulatory framework, remain to be solved before these novel products are translated into clinical practice.\n## Lipidic Nanoparticles against Neurodegeneration\nTheir physicochemical properties can significantly affect microglial modulation. Specifically, nanoparticle size and surface modifications can influence their retention time and subsequently the concentration of nanoparticles within microglia [31]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles exposed to biological fluids interact with plasma components, leading to the formation of a protein corona. The composition of this corona is also influenced by the physicochemical characteristics (i.e., lipid composition, size, \u03b6-potential, surface modifications) of the nanoparticles and depends on the biological environment in which they are dispersed. This modulation affects the physiological interactions of the nanoparticles in vivo, influencing pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and targeting Several techniques have been utilized to bypass the BBB, including invasive methods such as injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intracerebroventricular injection. However, neurosurgery poses high risks and has limited efficacy [27]. Nanoparticles, including lipid-based ones, can effectively enter the brain through the disruption of tight junctions and transcytosis, which is mediated by low-density lipoproteins, insulin, and transferrin receptors [28,29]. Lipid-based nanoparticles, upon entering the brain, interact with the microglial cell membrane through endocytosis. This process involves phagocytosis for larger particles and pinocytosis for smaller ones, which are further classified into clathrinmediated, caveolae-mediated, clathrin-and caveolae-independent, and micropinocytosis processes [30]. In addition to these active transport mechanisms, nanoparticles can also penetrate cells through passive diffusion. Their physicochemical properties can significantly affect microglial modulation. Specifically, nanoparticle size and surface modifications can influence their retention time and subsequently the concentration of nanoparticles within microglia [31]. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles exposed to biological fluids interact with plasma components, leading to the formation of a protein corona.",

However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and lungs.",

In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

Using core-shell nanoparticles with a same PEGylated lipid bilayer shell yet cores differing in elasticity (45 kPa \u2013 760 MPa) as models, we isolate the effects of nanoparticle elasticity from those of other physiochemical parameters and, using mouse models, observe a non-monotonic relationship of systemic circulation lifetime versus nanoparticle elasticity. Incubating our nanoparticles in mouse plasma provides protein coronas varying non-monotonically in composition depending on nanoparticle elasticity. Particularly, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) is the only protein whose relative abundance in corona strongly correlates with our nanoparticles\u2019 blood clearance lifetime. Notably, similar results are observed when above nanoparticles\u2019 PEGylated lipid bilayer shell is changed to be non-PEGylated. This work unveils the mechanisms by which nanoparticle elasticity affects nanoparticles\u2019 physiological fate and suggests nanoparticle elasticity as a readily tunable parameter in future rational exploiting of protein corona. Nanoparticle elasticity is known to affect physiological fate but how this occurs is largely unknown. Here, the authors report on a study using nanoparticles differing in elasticity alone to show a difference in the protein corona, in particular apolipoprotein A-1 absorption, corresponds to differences in circulation time.\n",

Here, we investigated the protein coronas formed on liposomes of basic compositions containing combinations of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and cholesterol. Liposome\u2212protein complexes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography were delipidated and analyzed using label-free LC-MS/MS. The addition of the anionic lipid and cholesterol both affected the relative protein abundances (and not the total bound proteins) in the coronas. Highly anionic liposomes, namely those containing 40% POPG, carried corona enriched with cationic proteins (apolipoprotein C1, beta-2-glycoprotein 1, and cathelicidins) and were the least stable in the calcein release assay. Cholesterol improved the liposome stability in the plasma. However, the differences in the corona compositions had little effect on the liposome uptake by endothelial (EA.hy926) and phagocytic cells in the culture (U937) or ex vivo (blood-derived monocytes and neutrophils). The findings emphasize that the effect of protein corona on the performance of the liposomes as drug carriers occurs through compromising particle stability rather than interfering with cellular uptake.",

However, changes in the lipid composition led to a considerable shift in relative abundances of the proteins in the coronas, which affects liposome integrity in the presence of plasma proteins. We confirmed the positive effect of cholesterol in liposomes on their stability in plasma. Cholesterol somewhat improved the liposome recognition by neutrophils as well, which at least partially depended on the protein corona composition. Overall, the effect of the differences in the lipid bilayer and protein corona compositions on the liposome uptake by cells was negligible. \n\nExpanding the array of basic liposome compositions to investigate their protein coronas and correlating the results with the in vivo data should be the next steps of the research. Exploring the roles of individual proteins found to be differentially bound on the liposomes would also contribute to our understanding of the protein corona effects on liposome carriers and it would improve the design of the new ones.",

                    "text": "The concept of biomolecular corona as a natural interface adopted by nanoparticles in biological media has been dominating the field of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems since it was introduced [1,2]. The layer of proteins, as well as other biomolecules deposited on the surface of the nanoparticles in the plasma and other bodily fluids, is determined by the nanoparticle composition and has been shown to be involved in nanoparticle-cell interactions, affecting the biodistribution of the carrier, internalization rates by cells, and intracellular trafficking [3,4]. As pioneers of clinically approved drug delivery vehicles, liposomes still represent attractive carriers due to their biocompatibility [5], robust technologies of production [6], and versatility. Precise knowledge of the laws regarding the formation of protein corona and its effects on clinical outcomes could provide guidance for Membranes 2023, 13, 681 2 of 23 the entire field of nanomedicine. Nevertheless, studies on the protein corona of lipid-based nanoparticles are considerably underrepresented in nanobiointerface research [7]. \n\nIn early works, the liposome circulation time was shown to be dependent on the lipid composition, which determines the fluidity and surface charge of the bilayer [8]. Fluid-phase liposomes have long been known to be rapidly cleared from circulation, which correlated with rather high amounts of bound plasma proteins [8] (this has kept the interest in fluid phase-based liposomes as drug vehicles relatively low). The integrity of liposomes in the presence of plasma proteins due to the robustness of the solid-phase (and even more so liquid ordered-phase) bilayer does have a flip side, namely slower intracellular processing [9]; neither was it found to be beneficial for hydrophobic drugs incorporated in the lipid bilayer of liposomes, which escape solid phase-based liposomes in the plasma more easily [10]. While some negatively charged lipids increase protein binding (PB) by liposomes and, thus, decrease the clearance time, phosphatidylglycerol affects the clearance but not the PB value [11].",

However, only fragments of the vast space of lipidic compositions have been explored thus far, mainly focusing on clinically approved formulations, such as DOXIL and Ambisome, and often lipoplexes. This was accompanied by an inconsistent approach to the isolation of liposome-associated proteins from their mixtures with plasma, often leading to considerable and uncontrolled contamination with other biological entities of a similar size and density as the liposomes and, thus, to contradictory results [28]. \n\nWe initiated this study on plasma protein binding by basic lipid compositions as part of a larger effort to elucidate the trends in how liposome composition determines plasma protein adsorption in a well-controlled and consistent experimental setup. In this paper, we investigated the impact of a negatively charged phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and/or cholesterol on plasma protein absorption by fluid-phase liposomes. We started with isolation of the liposome\u2212protein complexes and analysis of the protein corona composition with LC-MS/MS. We then compared liposome stability in the presence of plasma proteins with respect to cargo release. Finally, we assessed the liposome uptake by cultured and isolated blood cells as the basic functional effects of protein binding.",

Tretiakova, Maria Kobanenko, Anna Alekseeva, I. Boldyrev, S. Khaidukov, V. Zgoda, O. Tikhonova, E. Vodovozova, N. Onishchenko\n## Abstract\nDespite the undisputable role of the protein corona in the biointeractions of liposome drug carriers, the field suffers from a lack of knowledge regarding the patterns of protein deposition on lipid surfaces with different compositions. Here, we investigated the protein coronas formed on liposomes of basic compositions containing combinations of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and cholesterol. Liposome\u2212protein complexes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography were delipidated and analyzed using label-free LC-MS/MS. The addition of the anionic lipid and cholesterol both affected the relative protein abundances (and not the total bound proteins) in the coronas. Highly anionic liposomes, namely those containing 40% POPG, carried corona enriched with cationic proteins (apolipoprotein C1, beta-2-glycoprotein 1, and cathelicidins) and were the least stable in the calcein release assay. Cholesterol improved the liposome stability in the plasma. However, the differences in the corona compositions had little effect on the liposome uptake by endothelial (EA.hy926) and phagocytic cells in the culture (U937) or ex vivo (blood-derived monocytes and neutrophils). The findings emphasize that the effect of protein corona on the performance of the liposomes as drug carriers occurs through compromising particle stability rather than interfering with cellular uptake.\n## Introduction\nThe concept of biomolecular corona as a natural interface adopted by nanoparticles in biological media has been dominating the field of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems since it was introduced [1,2]. The layer of proteins, as well as other biomolecules deposited on the surface of the nanoparticles in the plasma and other bodily fluids, is determined by the nanoparticle composition and has been shown to be involved in nanoparticle-cell interactions, affecting the biodistribution of the carrier, internalization rates by cells, and intracellular trafficking [3,4]. As pioneers of clinically approved drug delivery vehicles, liposomes still represent attractive carriers due to their biocompatibility [5], robust technologies of production [6], and versatility. Precise knowledge of the laws regarding the formation of protein corona and its effects on clinical outcomes could provide guidance for Membranes 2023, 13, 681 2 of 23 the entire field of nanomedicine. Nevertheless, studies on the protein corona of lipid-based nanoparticles are considerably underrepresented in nanobiointerface research [7]. \n\nIn early works, the liposome circulation time was shown to be dependent on the lipid composition, which determines the fluidity and surface charge of the bilayer [8]. Fluid-phase liposomes have long been known to be rapidly cleared from circulation, which correlated with rather high amounts of bound plasma proteins [8] (this has kept the interest in fluid phase-based liposomes as drug vehicles relatively low). The integrity of liposomes in the presence of plasma proteins due to the robustness of the solid-phase (and even more so liquid ordered-phase) bilayer does have a flip side, namely slower intracellular processing [9]; neither was it found to be beneficial for hydrophobic drugs incorporated in the lipid bilayer of liposomes, which escape solid phase-based liposomes in the plasma more easily [10]. While some negatively charged lipids increase protein binding (PB) by liposomes and, thus, decrease the clearance time, phosphatidylglycerol affects the clearance but not the PB value [11].\n...\nThis, in turn, led to the first use of bioinformatics to predict liposomal behavior based on the composition of the protein corona [27]. However, only fragments of the vast space of lipidic compositions have been explored thus far, mainly focusing on clinically approved formulations, such as DOXIL and Ambisome, and often lipoplexes. This was accompanied by an inconsistent approach to the isolation of liposome-associated proteins from their mixtures with plasma, often leading to considerable and uncontrolled contamination with other biological entities of a similar size and density as the liposomes and, thus, to contradictory results [28]. \n\nWe initiated this study on plasma protein binding by basic lipid compositions as part of a larger effort to elucidate the trends in how liposome composition determines plasma protein adsorption in a well-controlled and consistent experimental setup. In this paper, we investigated the impact of a negatively charged phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and/or cholesterol on plasma protein absorption by fluid-phase liposomes. We started with isolation of the liposome\u2212protein complexes and analysis of the protein corona composition with LC-MS/MS. We then compared liposome stability in the presence of plasma proteins with respect to cargo release. Finally, we assessed the liposome uptake by cultured and isolated blood cells as the basic functional effects of protein binding.\n\n## Conclusions\nIn the study, we showed that both the total amount of proteins and the number of protein species associated with the liposomes in plasma depend little on the bilayer composition thereof (liquid ordered or disordered phase of neutral or anionic bilayer). However, changes in the lipid composition led to a considerable shift in relative abundances of the proteins in the coronas, which affects liposome integrity in the presence of plasma proteins. We confirmed the positive effect of cholesterol in liposomes on their stability in plasma. Cholesterol somewhat improved the liposome recognition by neutrophils as well, which at least partially depended on the protein corona composition. Overall, the effect of the differences in the lipid bilayer and protein corona compositions on the liposome uptake by cells was negligible. \n\nExpanding the array of basic liposome compositions to investigate their protein coronas and correlating the results with the in vivo data should be the next steps of the research. Exploring the roles of individual proteins found to be differentially bound on the liposomes would also contribute to our understanding of the protein corona effects on liposome carriers and it would improve the design of the new ones.",

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.\n## PEGylated lipid-Modulating serum protein adsorption for tissue targeting\nThe study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.Furthermore, the PEG content significantly affects targeting of extrahepatic tissues.For instance, Zhang et al. [69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

Lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent leading approaches for the clinical translation of genetic drugs. These systems circumnavigate biological barriers and facilitate the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids in the correct cells of the target organ using passive, active and endogenous targeting mechanisms. In this Review, we highlight the constituent materials of these advanced nanoparticles, their nucleic acid cargoes and how they journey through the body. We discuss targeting principles for liver delivery, as it is the organ most successfully targeted by intravenously administered nanoparticles to date, followed by the expansion of these concepts to extrahepatic (non-liver) delivery.

The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

Dilliard, D. Siegwart\n## Abstract\nNucleic acids for gene silencing, expression and editing can precisely target disease at the molecular level but require effective delivery systems. This Review discusses the material and biological principles used to design delivery systems to target specific organs in the body. Genetic drugs based on nucleic acid biomolecules are a rapidly emerging class of medicines that directly reprogramme the central dogma of biology to prevent and treat disease. However, multiple biological barriers normally impede\u00a0the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids, necessitating the use of a delivery system. Lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent leading approaches for the clinical translation of genetic drugs. These systems circumnavigate biological barriers and facilitate the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids in the correct cells of the target organ using passive, active and endogenous targeting mechanisms. In this Review, we highlight the constituent materials of these advanced nanoparticles, their nucleic acid cargoes and how they journey through the body. We discuss targeting principles for liver delivery, as it is the organ most successfully targeted by intravenously administered nanoparticles to date, followed by the expansion of these concepts to extrahepatic (non-liver) delivery. Ultimately, this Review connects emerging materials and biological insights playing key roles in targeting specific organs and cells in vivo.\n## Review article\nof studies on nanoparticle organ targeting have focused on how plasma proteins impact delivery outcomes. The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

Nanoparticles obtained from biopolymers for applications in medicine and pharmaceutics have become particularly popular in recent years due to the enormous research effort in the field of vaccines to respond to the pandemic emergency. Among the various types of biopolymers used to produce nanoparticles for therapeutics, lipids have characteristics that make them biocompatible, with low toxicity and ease of clearance. They can be synthesized by designing their characteristics according to the foreseen administration path, or to the target of the transported drug. The analytical methods mostly used to evaluate the characteristics of lipid nanosytems for drug delivery involve studying their effects on cells, in vitro and in vivo. Although it is often considered a \u201cniche technique\u201c for research in the bio-related sciences, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a versatile tool to study the structure of nanosystems based on lipids, both ex situ and in situ. Therefore, it allows to evaluate both the effect of the different synthesis parameters and of the exposure of lipid nanoparticles to physiological conditions, which is of fundamental importance to design efficient drug delivery systems. In this mini-review, we will report some recent examples of characterization and design of nanoparticles based on lipids, where SAXS has been a fundamental step both to guide the synthesis of nanomaterials with tailored characteristics, and to understand the interaction between nanomaterials and cells.",

The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

Sartori, B. Marmiroli\n## Abstract\nThanks to specific physico-chemical properties, drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles have proven to effectively transport delicate molecules for therapeutic purposes, protecting them from degradation, increasing their stability in the blood circulation and allowing to convey and release the transported substances in specific areas of the body. Nanoparticles obtained from biopolymers for applications in medicine and pharmaceutics have become particularly popular in recent years due to the enormous research effort in the field of vaccines to respond to the pandemic emergency. Among the various types of biopolymers used to produce nanoparticles for therapeutics, lipids have characteristics that make them biocompatible, with low toxicity and ease of clearance. They can be synthesized by designing their characteristics according to the foreseen administration path, or to the target of the transported drug. The analytical methods mostly used to evaluate the characteristics of lipid nanosytems for drug delivery involve studying their effects on cells, in vitro and in vivo. Although it is often considered a \u201cniche technique\u201c for research in the bio-related sciences, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a versatile tool to study the structure of nanosystems based on lipids, both ex situ and in situ. Therefore, it allows to evaluate both the effect of the different synthesis parameters and of the exposure of lipid nanoparticles to physiological conditions, which is of fundamental importance to design efficient drug delivery systems. In this mini-review, we will report some recent examples of characterization and design of nanoparticles based on lipids, where SAXS has been a fundamental step both to guide the synthesis of nanomaterials with tailored characteristics, and to understand the interaction between nanomaterials and cells.\n## Biomolecular Corona\nIn vivo, lipid vectors for drug delivery adsorb proteins, lipids and other plasmatic biomolecules on their surface in a non-specific manner once injected: depending on the nanoparticles' properties, such as their charge, hydrophilicity, dimensions and morphology, the several components present in plasma interact and build a coating. The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.\n...\nTEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.

To decipher the underlying mechanisms contributing to the lung-specificity of LSNPs-mediated protein delivery, we performed a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the tissue tropism of nanoparticles.

As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13A (SI Appendix), both types of nanoparticles exhibited an average diameter of around 110 nm. However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles.

This causality-based approach could empower the nanomedicine community to better anticipate how shifts in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles affect the protein corona composition. For instance, this strategy offers a high-throughput potential for predicting the biological identity of various nanoparticle formulations intended for safe and effective genomic medicine delivery systems. \u221222 By understanding the actual causality linked to the essential components of nanoparticles, such as their composition, physicochemical properties, and surface coatings, we can better predict the biological fate and pharmacokinetics of nanomedicines. This will facilitate high-throughput screening and enable precise analysis of their biomolecular corona. 22",

The protein corona alters the physicochemical properties, toxicity, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and immune response of the nanoparticles, and consequently, their therapeutic efficacy.

Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

D. Ianni, G. A. Islan, C. Y. Chain, G. R. Castro, A. Talevi, andMar\u00eda E. Vela\n## Abstract\nThe applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.\n## Introduction\nPharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "abstract": "The long quest for efficient drug administration has been looking for a universal carrier that can precisely transport traditional drugs, new genomic and proteic therapeutic agents. Today, researchers have found conditions to overcome the two main drug delivery dilemmas. On the one side, the versatility of the vehicle to efficiently load, protect and transport the drug and then release it at the target place. On the other hand, the questions related to the degree of PEGylation which are needed to avoid nanoparticle (NP) aggregation and opsonization while preventing cellular uptake. The development of different kinds of lipidic drug delivery vehicles and particles has resulted in the development of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs), which can overcome most of the typical drug delivery problems. Proof of their success is the late approval and massive administration as the prophylactic vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. These ILNPs are built by electrostatic aggregation of surfactants, the therapeutic agent, and lipids that self-segregate from an aqueous solution, forming nanoparticles stabilized with lipid polymers, such as PEG. These vehicles overcome previous limitations such as low loading and high toxicity, likely thanks to low charge at the working pH and reduced size, and their entry into the cells via endocytosis rather than membrane perforation or fusion, always associated with higher toxicity. We herein revise their primary features, synthetic methods to prepare and characterize them, pharmacokinetic (administration, distribution, metabolization and excretion) aspects, and biodistribution and fate. Owing to their advantages, iLNPs are potential drug delivery systems to improve the management of various diseases and widely available for clinical use.",

But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

Bastus, V. Puntes\n## Abstract\nThe long quest for efficient drug administration has been looking for a universal carrier that can precisely transport traditional drugs, new genomic and proteic therapeutic agents. Today, researchers have found conditions to overcome the two main drug delivery dilemmas. On the one side, the versatility of the vehicle to efficiently load, protect and transport the drug and then release it at the target place. On the other hand, the questions related to the degree of PEGylation which are needed to avoid nanoparticle (NP) aggregation and opsonization while preventing cellular uptake. The development of different kinds of lipidic drug delivery vehicles and particles has resulted in the development of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (iLNPs), which can overcome most of the typical drug delivery problems. Proof of their success is the late approval and massive administration as the prophylactic vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. These ILNPs are built by electrostatic aggregation of surfactants, the therapeutic agent, and lipids that self-segregate from an aqueous solution, forming nanoparticles stabilized with lipid polymers, such as PEG. These vehicles overcome previous limitations such as low loading and high toxicity, likely thanks to low charge at the working pH and reduced size, and their entry into the cells via endocytosis rather than membrane perforation or fusion, always associated with higher toxicity. We herein revise their primary features, synthetic methods to prepare and characterize them, pharmacokinetic (administration, distribution, metabolization and excretion) aspects, and biodistribution and fate. Owing to their advantages, iLNPs are potential drug delivery systems to improve the management of various diseases and widely available for clinical use.\n## Transformations and metabolization\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system. But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

To achieve this goal, the surface chemistry of silica nanoparticles of 20 nm diameter was tailored via plasma polymerization with amine, carboxylic acid, oxazolines, and alkane functionalities. The results of this study show significant surface chemistry-induced differences in protein corona composition, which reflect in the subsequent inflammatory consequences. Nanoparticles rich with carboxylic acid surface functionalities increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to higher level of complement proteins and decreased the number of lipoproteins found in their protein coronas. On another hand, amine rich coatings led to increased expressions of anti-inflammatory markers such as arginase. The findings demonstrate the potential to direct physiological responses to nanomaterials via tailoring their surface chemical composition.",

Positively charged AA coated particles showed higher affinity to Apolipoprotein A-I (15% in serum and plasma) while HRG was determined at 13% in serum and 14% in plasma. In order to understand how the nanoparticles physico-chemical properties govern the composition of the corona, the adsorbed proteins were sorted by increasing molecular weight (Figures S6 and S7) and increasing isoelectric points (Figures S8 and S9). We observed a distinct enrichment of proteins of small molecular weight (such as Apolipoprotein A-I, HGR and Albumin) on all nanoparticle coronas.

Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda, Melanie N. Macgregor, R. Visalakshan, Artur Lazarian, Alex A. Cavallaro, S. Morsbach, A. Mierczynska-Vasilev, V. Mail\u00e4nder, K. Landfester, K. Vasilev\n## Abstract\nNanoparticles are widely used for biomedical applications such as vaccine, drug delivery, diagnostics, and therapeutics. This study aims to reveal the influence of nanoparticle surface functionalization on protein corona formation from blood serum and plasma and the subsequent effects on the innate immune cellular responses. To achieve this goal, the surface chemistry of silica nanoparticles of 20 nm diameter was tailored via plasma polymerization with amine, carboxylic acid, oxazolines, and alkane functionalities. The results of this study show significant surface chemistry-induced differences in protein corona composition, which reflect in the subsequent inflammatory consequences. Nanoparticles rich with carboxylic acid surface functionalities increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to higher level of complement proteins and decreased the number of lipoproteins found in their protein coronas. On another hand, amine rich coatings led to increased expressions of anti-inflammatory markers such as arginase. The findings demonstrate the potential to direct physiological responses to nanomaterials via tailoring their surface chemical composition.\n## Influence of Different Plasma Polymer Chemistries on Protein Corona Formation\nFor OD coated particles, the most prominent proteins were Apolipoprotein A-I (13% in serum, 15% in plasma), HRG (12% in serum and plasma) and Albumin (11% in serum, 12% in plasma). Positively charged AA coated particles showed higher affinity to Apolipoprotein A-I (15% in serum and plasma) while HRG was determined at 13% in serum and 14% in plasma. In order to understand how the nanoparticles physico-chemical properties govern the composition of the corona, the adsorbed proteins were sorted by increasing molecular weight (Figures S6 and S7) and increasing isoelectric points (Figures S8 and S9). We observed a distinct enrichment of proteins of small molecular weight (such as Apolipoprotein A-I, HGR and Albumin) on all nanoparticle coronas. In our previous study focused on protein adsorption on planar plasma polymer-coated substrates, one of the top five bound proteins was Apolipoprotein B-100 (MW = 517.0 KDa) [52]. In contrast, in the present study, the largest protein observed in the top five most abundant proteins adsorbed on PPSiNPs was Albumin, which is only 69.4 KDa in molecular weight. Hence, the present results indicate that protein adsorption on nanoparticles isn't a process governed by chemistry alone, but that steric effects due to the particles curvature also influence the corona composition [63]. \n\nIt is often suggested that positively charged proteins are attracted to negatively charged surfaces [64].

Whilst the regulatory approval of several of these nanoformulations has proven their translatability, there remain several hurdles to the translation of future nanoformulations, leading to a high rate of candidate nanoformulations failing during the drug development process. One barrier is that the difficulty in tightly controlling nanoscale particle synthesis leads to particle-to-particle heterogeneity, which hinders manufacturing and quality control, and regulatory quality checks. To understand and mitigate this heterogeneity requires advancements in nanoformulation characterisation beyond traditional bulk methods to more precise, single particle techniques. In this review, we compare commercially available single particle techniques, with a particular focus on single particle Raman spectroscopy, to provide a guide to adoption of these methods into development workflows, to ultimately reduce barriers to the translation of future nanoformulations.",

This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

One barrier is that the difficulty in tightly controlling nanoscale particle synthesis leads to particle-to-particle heterogeneity, which hinders manufacturing and quality control, and regulatory quality checks. To understand and mitigate this heterogeneity requires advancements in nanoformulation characterisation beyond traditional bulk methods to more precise, single particle techniques. In this review, we compare commercially available single particle techniques, with a particular focus on single particle Raman spectroscopy, to provide a guide to adoption of these methods into development workflows, to ultimately reduce barriers to the translation of future nanoformulations.\n## Surface Functionalisation and Interactions\nOne key biological interaction is protein fouling, or protein corona formation, where proteins adsorb to the nanoparticle surface upon exposure to serum. This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

Reliable characterization of the protein corona is, therefore, a vital step in the development of safe and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine products. 2134 published manuscripts on the protein corona are reviewed and a down-selection of 470 papers spanning 2000\u20132021, comprising 1702 nanoparticle (NP) systems is analyzed. This analysis reveals: i) most corona studies have been conducted on metal and metal oxide nanoparticles; ii) despite their overwhelming presence in clinical practice, lipid-based NPs are underrepresented in protein corona research, iii) studies use new methods to improve reliability and reproducibility in protein corona research; iv) studies use more specific protein sources toward personalized medicine; and v) careful characterization of nanoparticles after corona formation is imperative to minimize the role of aggregation and protein contamination on corona outcomes. As nanoparticles used in biomedicine become increasingly prevalent and biochemically complex, the field of protein corona research will need to focus on developing analytical approaches and characterization techniques appropriate for each unique nanoparticle formulation. Achieving such characterization of the nano-bio interface of nanobiotechnologies will enable more seamless development and safe implementation of nanoparticles in medicine.",

Our comprehensive overview of the current protein corona literature on various types of NPs reveals the need for conducting studies with more robustness NP characterization, improving experimental repeats, and using methodologies that minimizes protein contamination and nanoparticle aggregation during the protein corona formation and collection processes. The NP corona formation in each class of nanomaterials has utmost importance specially if there is a potential of translation into a product. For example, amongst all class of NPs, lipid based NP are the most commonly utilized NPs in the clinic, yet their soft core structure often presents a hurdle for NP analysis. Hence, more reliable and accurate protein corona information for lipid-based NPs may enable scientists to develop safer and more efficient lipid-based nanoformulations. In particular, detailed information on the protein corona decoration at the surface of lipid-based NPs may improve our understanding of liver accumulation of these NPs [44] and could generally enable better design-based approaches to their bio-distribution, biocompatibility, and payload delivery outcomes in vivo. In another example, compositional variations in lipid-based NPs were shown to significantly change their targeting efficacies to specific organs. [45,46] The complete replacement of a conventional helper lipid with an alternative anionic or cationic lipid was shown to cause a pronounced and consistent shift of lipid NPs biodistribution in vivo from to either the mouse spleen or lung. [47] The proposed mechanism for such a striking shift in NP fate in vivo is that NPs formulated with neutral or anionic helper lipids can be uptaken by epithelial and immune cells to the spleen or lung, respectively. Robust information on the protein corona profiles of these NPs are essential to define the exact mechanism of action for these and other similar NPs. [48]",

Mahmoud, A. Ashkarran, Elizabeth Voke, V. Serpooshan, Milad Ramezankhani, A. Milani, M. Landry, M. Mahmoudi\n## Abstract\nThe protein corona forms spontaneously on nanoparticle surfaces when nanomaterials are introduced into any biological system/fluid. Reliable characterization of the protein corona is, therefore, a vital step in the development of safe and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine products. 2134 published manuscripts on the protein corona are reviewed and a down-selection of 470 papers spanning 2000\u20132021, comprising 1702 nanoparticle (NP) systems is analyzed. This analysis reveals: i) most corona studies have been conducted on metal and metal oxide nanoparticles; ii) despite their overwhelming presence in clinical practice, lipid-based NPs are underrepresented in protein corona research, iii) studies use new methods to improve reliability and reproducibility in protein corona research; iv) studies use more specific protein sources toward personalized medicine; and v) careful characterization of nanoparticles after corona formation is imperative to minimize the role of aggregation and protein contamination on corona outcomes. As nanoparticles used in biomedicine become increasingly prevalent and biochemically complex, the field of protein corona research will need to focus on developing analytical approaches and characterization techniques appropriate for each unique nanoparticle formulation. Achieving such characterization of the nano-bio interface of nanobiotechnologies will enable more seamless development and safe implementation of nanoparticles in medicine.\n## Conclusions and Future Perspectives\nRobust characterization of nanomaterials and biological fluids together with accurate methodological approaches to study the formation and subsequent analysis of the protein corona are essential steps in achieving a robust literature database towards designing NP-based therapeutics with higher translatability into clinical practice. Our comprehensive overview of the current protein corona literature on various types of NPs reveals the need for conducting studies with more robustness NP characterization, improving experimental repeats, and using methodologies that minimizes protein contamination and nanoparticle aggregation during the protein corona formation and collection processes. The NP corona formation in each class of nanomaterials has utmost importance specially if there is a potential of translation into a product. For example, amongst all class of NPs, lipid based NP are the most commonly utilized NPs in the clinic, yet their soft core structure often presents a hurdle for NP analysis. Hence, more reliable and accurate protein corona information for lipid-based NPs may enable scientists to develop safer and more efficient lipid-based nanoformulations. In particular, detailed information on the protein corona decoration at the surface of lipid-based NPs may improve our understanding of liver accumulation of these NPs [44] and could generally enable better design-based approaches to their bio-distribution, biocompatibility, and payload delivery outcomes in vivo. In another example, compositional variations in lipid-based NPs were shown to significantly change their targeting efficacies to specific organs. [45,46] The complete replacement of a conventional helper lipid with an alternative anionic or cationic lipid was shown to cause a pronounced and consistent shift of lipid NPs biodistribution in vivo from to either the mouse spleen or lung. [47] The proposed mechanism for such a striking shift in NP fate in vivo is that NPs formulated with neutral or anionic helper lipids can be uptaken by epithelial and immune cells to the spleen or lung, respectively. Robust information on the protein corona profiles of these NPs are essential to define the exact mechanism of action for these and other similar NPs. [48]",

As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.",

Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

Paulusse\n## Abstract\nSafe and reliable entry to the brain is essential for successful diagnosis and treatment of diseases, but it still poses major challenges. As a result, many therapeutic approaches to treating disorders associated with the central nervous system (CNS) still only show limited success. Nano-sized systems are being explored as drug carriers and show great improvements in the delivery of many therapeutics. The systemic delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocarriers (NCs) to the brain involves reaching the neurovascular unit (NVU), being transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier, (BBB) and accumulating in the brain. Each of these steps can benefit from specifically controlled properties of NPs. Here, we discuss how brain delivery by NPs can benefit from careful design of the NP properties. Properties such as size, charge, shape, and ligand functionalization are commonly addressed in the literature; however, properties such as ligand density, linker length, avidity, protein corona, and stiffness are insufficiently discussed. This is unfortunate since they present great value against multiple barriers encountered by the NPs before reaching the brain, particularly the BBB. We further highlight important examples utilizing targeting ligands and how functionalization parameters, e.g., ligand density and ligand properties, can affect the success of the nano-based delivery system.\n## Protein Corona\nProtein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

The biomolecular corona confers a unique biological identity to nanoparticles, and its protein composition plays a deterministic role in the biological fate of nanoparticles. The physiological behavior of proteins stems from their physicochemical aspects including surface charge, hydrophobicity, and structural stability. However, there is insufficient understanding about the role of physicochemical properties of proteins in biomolecular corona formation. We hypothesized that the physicochemical properties of proteins would influence their interaction with nanoparticles and have a deterministic effect on nanoparticle-cell interactions. To test our hypothesis, we used model proteins from different structural classes to understand the effect of secondary structure elements of proteins on the nanoparticle-protein interface.

Lohiya, Harini Devenderan, D. Katti\n## Abstract\nNanoparticles, on exposure to the biological milieu, tend to interact with macromolecules to form a biomolecular corona. The biomolecular corona confers a unique biological identity to nanoparticles, and its protein composition plays a deterministic role in the biological fate of nanoparticles. The physiological behavior of proteins stems from their physicochemical aspects including surface charge, hydrophobicity, and structural stability. However, there is insufficient understanding about the role of physicochemical properties of proteins in biomolecular corona formation. We hypothesized that the physicochemical properties of proteins would influence their interaction with nanoparticles and have a deterministic effect on nanoparticle-cell interactions. To test our hypothesis, we used model proteins from different structural classes to understand the effect of secondary structure elements of proteins on the nanoparticle-protein interface. Further, we modified the surface of proteins to study the role of protein surface characteristics in governing the nanoparticle-protein interface. For this study, we used mesoporous silica nanoparticles as a model nanoparticle system. We observed that the surface charge of proteins governs the nature of the primary interaction as well as the extent of subsequent secondary interactions causing structural rearrangements of the protein.

The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum.

On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance.

Here, we show that spiking small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (namely, glucose, triglyceride, diglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol, inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate, and B complex), into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on otherwise identical NPs, significantly enhancing the depth of plasma proteome profiling. The protein coronas on polystyrene NPs when exposed to plasma treated with an array of small molecules (n=10) allowed for detection of 1793 proteins marking an 8.25-fold increase in the number of quantified proteins compared to plasma alone (218 proteins) and a 2.63-fold increase relative to the untreated protein corona (681 proteins). Furthermore, we discovered that adding 1000 \u00b5g/ml phosphatidylcholine could singularly enable the detection of 897 proteins. At this specific concentration, phosphatidylcholine selectively depleted the four most abundant plasma proteins, including albumin, thus reducing the dynamic range of plasma proteome and enabling the detection of proteins with lower abundance. By employing an optimized data-independent acquisition (DIA) approach, the inclusion of phosphatidylcholine led to the detection of 1436 proteins in a single plasma sample. Our molecular dynamic results revealed that phosphatidylcholine interacts with albumin via hydrophobic interactions, h-bonds, and water-bridges. Addition of phosphatidylcholine also enabled the detection of 337 additional proteoforms compared to untreated protein corona using a top-down proteomics approach. These significant achievements are made utilizing only a single NP type and one small molecule to analyze a single plasma sample, setting a new standard in plasma proteome profiling. Given the critical role of plasma proteomics in biomarker discovery and disease monitoring, we anticipate widespread adoption of this methodology for identification and clinical translation of proteomic biomarkers into FDA approved diagnostics.",

Currently, efforts have been mainly made to construct targeted LNPs for organ- or cell-type-specific delivery of nucleic acid drugs by conjugation with various types of ligands. In this review, we describe the surface engineering strategies for nucleic acid-LNPs, considering ligand types, conjugation chemistries, and incorporation methods. We then outline the general purification and characterization techniques that are frequently used following the engineering step and emphasize the specific techniques for certain types of ligands. Next, we comprehensively summarize the currently accessible organs and cell types, as well as the other applications of the engineered LNPs. Finally, we provide considerations for formulating targeted LNPs and discuss the challenges of successfully translating the \u201cproof of concept\u201d from the laboratory into the clinic. We believe that addressing these challenges could accelerate the development of surface-engineered LNPs for targeted nucleic acid delivery and beyond.",

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

Currently, efforts have been mainly made to construct targeted LNPs for organ- or cell-type-specific delivery of nucleic acid drugs by conjugation with various types of ligands. In this review, we describe the surface engineering strategies for nucleic acid-LNPs, considering ligand types, conjugation chemistries, and incorporation methods. We then outline the general purification and characterization techniques that are frequently used following the engineering step and emphasize the specific techniques for certain types of ligands. Next, we comprehensively summarize the currently accessible organs and cell types, as well as the other applications of the engineered LNPs. Finally, we provide considerations for formulating targeted LNPs and discuss the challenges of successfully translating the \u201cproof of concept\u201d from the laboratory into the clinic. We believe that addressing these challenges could accelerate the development of surface-engineered LNPs for targeted nucleic acid delivery and beyond.\n## SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\nBesides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles-based drug delivery systems have attracted significant attention in biomedical fields because they can deliver loaded cargoes to the target site in a controlled manner. However, tremendous challenges must still be overcome to reach the expected targeting and therapeutic efficacy in vivo . These challenges mainly arise because the interaction between nanoparticles and biological systems is complex and dynamic and is influenced by the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and the heterogeneity of biological systems. Importantly, once the nanoparticles are injected into the blood, a protein corona will inevitably form on the surface. The protein corona creates a new biological identity which plays a vital role in mediating the bio-nano interaction and determining the ultimate results. Thus, it is essential to understand how the protein corona affects the delivery journey of nanoparticles in vivo and what we can do to exploit the protein corona for better delivery efficiency. In this review, we first summarize the fundamental impact of the protein corona on the delivery journey of nanoparticles. Next, we emphasize the strategies that have been developed for tailoring and exploiting the protein corona to improve the transportation behavior of nanoparticles in vivo . Finally, we highlight what we need to do as a next step towards better understanding and exploitation of the protein corona. We hope these insights into the \u201cYin and Yang\u201d effect of the protein corona will have profound implications for understanding the role of the protein corona in a wide range of nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Pharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

The interactions between NPs and plasma proteins at the nano-bio interface affect their biopharmaceutical properties and distribution in the organ and tissues due to protein corona (PrC) composition, and in turn, modification of the resulting targeting capability. Moreover, lipid and polymer NPs, at their interface, affect the composition of PrC and the relative adsorption and abundance of specific proteins. To investigate this latter aspect, we synthesized and characterized different liposomal formulations (LFs) with lipids and polymer-conjugated lipids at different molar ratios, having different sizes, size distributions and surface charges. The PrC composition of various designed LFs was evaluated ex vivo in human plasma by label-free quantitative proteomics. We also correlated the relative abundance of identified specific proteins in the coronas of the different LFs with their physicochemical properties (size, PDI, zeta potential). The evaluation of outputs from different bioinformatic tools discovered protein clusters allowing to highlight: (i) common as well as the unique species for the various formulations; (ii) correlation between each identified PrC and the physicochemical properties of LFs; (iii) some preferential binding determined by physicochemical properties of LFs; (iv) occurrence of formulation-specific protein patterns in PrC. Investigating specific clusters in PrC will help decode the multivalent roles of the protein pattern components in the drug delivery process, taking advantage of the bio-nanoscale recognition and identification for significant advances in nanomedicine.",

However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81].

            "text": "Non-specific interactions between nanoparticles and plasma proteins occur when the nanoparticles enter the blood. As a result, coating the original nanoparticles with a protein corona alters the in vivo fate of nanoparticles as well as the biological responses to the nanoparticles. This is one of the substantial reasons for the two main problems associated with nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, i.e., nanotoxicity and the rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the blood after intravenous injection. A preformed albumin corona has been shown to inhibit plasma proteins such as IgG adsorption, decrease complement activation, reduce the macrophage-related phagocytosis, and ultimately prolong the blood circulation time and reduce the toxicity of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, nanoparticle-albumin complexes show an enhanced bioavailability compared to naked nanoparticles [34].\n\nLiposomes are plagued by rapid opsonization, leading to the shortening of their circulation time in the bloodstream. Interactions between liposomes and plasma proteins have been investigated in order to evaluate the role of liposomal lipid composition and concentration in forming the protein corona. Protein corona formation depends on the presence of PEG, cholesterol, the concentration of the components, and surface charge. Liposomes incorporating 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids and cholesterol both in a molar ratio of 11% were reported to be stable over time, while their size was not altered dramatically in a biological medium. Liposomes containing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. Lipid composition and concentration have an effect on the adsorption of proteins and on liposomal stabilization [35].\n\nThe encapsulation of curcumin in a liposome improves its bioavailability and stability, but the short half-life remains an issue. Albumin was used to coat the liposomal curcumin to produce a long-circulating delivery system. Albumin-coated liposomal curcumin particles were more spherical, more homogeneous in size, and significantly larger than liposomal curc",

In blood, the EV protein corona typically consists of immunoglobulins, complement proteins, coagulation factors, cytokines, enzymes, DNA, and RNAs (Cvjetkovic et al., 2016;Buz\u00e1s et al., 2018). When blood proteins are part of the protein corona, they can have notable effects on EVs, including their mobility, interactions with their surroundings or target surfaces, and recognition by the immune system, which will affect the physiological role of the EVs (Strojan et al., 2017;Buz\u00e1s et al., 2018;Charoenviriyakul et al., 2018;Skliar et al., 2018;Ezzat et al., 2019). It is therefore important to efficiently remove unbound blood proteins from EV isolates, while still appreciating the physiological roles of blood proteins that are bound to EVs as the protein corona. The purity of EV preparations can also be evaluated by determination of the nanoparticle-to-protein ratio or the nanoparticle-to-lipid ratio (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2019). \n\nAnother common contaminant of blood EV isolates are the lipoproteins (Table 1). These are spherical particles that transport the major lipids in the bloodstream of humans throughout the body. They consist of an amphipathic surface of protein(s), free cholesterol, and phospholipids, which surround a hydrophobic core that contains cholesterol esters and triacylglycerols (Ference et al., 2020).

            "text": "Blood serves as the first barrier for nanodelivery systems administered by intravenous injection. The development of a protein corona around circulating nanoparticles occurs through the absorption of plasma proteins, including serum albumin, apolipoproteins, complement components, and immunoglobulins. 54 Besides, the formation of protein corona depends on the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including surface charge, shape, size, and hydrophobicity. 55 he protein corona on the surface of nanoparticles facilitates their recognition and binding to specific receptors on phagocytic cells, followed by internalization, transportation to phagosomes, and fusion with lysosomes. 56 Therefore, the formation of protein corona reduces the circulation and time-dependent EPR effect of nanovectors. The protein corona not only weakens passive targeting, but also diminishes the active-targeting characteristic of nanovectors by covering targeting ligands with absorbed proteins, resulting in reduced targeting efficiency. The investigation revealed that the protein corona effectively prevented transferrin-combined nanoparticles from binding to their targeted receptors on A549 cells, as well as soluble transferrin receptors, resulting in a loss of targeting specificity. 57 Whether delivery systems are based on passive or active targeting properties, the process of protein opsonization in the bloodstream significantly impedes the accumulation of active ingredients at specific sites. This necessitates further investigation into methods for suppressing protein aggregation on the nanovector surface.",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge. SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

            "text": "The interaction of nanoparticles with physiological systems-the so-called \"nano-bio interface\"-is a complex process. It is therefore important to understand this mechanism in some detail before we delve into strategies to bypass first-pass metabolism. As we discussed, a nanoparticle's inherent composition, shape, size, and surface chemistry plays a crucial part in deciding its fate in systemic circulation. In this section, we discuss the role of two external parameters that play equally vital roles to affect circulation stability and the final disposition of a nanoparticle to the tumor: (i) formation of a protein corona and (ii) the mechanism of interactions between the nanoparticle and cells. \n\nWhen a nanoparticle enters the blood, it is coated with various serum proteins, forming a protein corona that changes the nanoparticle's synthetic identity, exposes new epitopes, and alters its function. The concept of a protein corona is thus an important parameter in shaping the final biological identity of the nanoparticle-hydrodynamic size, surface chemistry, net charge, and aggregation behavior [30,32,64]. Although this has been known for a long time, it is only recently that researchers were able to decipher the complex mixture of adsorbed proteins on nanoparticles. This was mainly led by the advancement of instrumentation and analytical methods, coupled with the motivation to shake the existing stagnancy of clinical translation for nanomedicine delivery systems [65][66][67]. Albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulins, transferrin, fibrinogen, complement C3, haptoglobin, and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin are some of the most abundant proteins that comprise the protein corona [32,68]. Nanoparticles interact with these proteins mainly through long range electrostatic Van der Waal's forces, as well as short-range hydrophobic interactions [33]. There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin.",

            "text": "A commonly investigated nanoparticle application is the development of target-specific drug carriers. Here, the corona may have an important role as plasma proteins have been shown to block ligands attached to the nanoparticle surface or compete with the interaction between ligands and cell receptors [20][21][22]. Dell'Orco et al. have previously modelled targeted delivery in the presence of an exchanging corona, to identify factors that are important for successful targeting [20,21,23]. The size of the bound proteins and their binding affinity for the particle surface were identified as very important. However, the particle size was found to be even more crutial. In the current work, this feature is addressed in experiments and confirmed to be important. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, all studies characterizing the protein corona are performed in serum or plasma stabilized with different agents. In this work we investigate the corona composition as a function of the source of the plasma proteins, i.e. dependent on the treatment of blood after withdrawal. Blood can, after withdrawal, be treated in different ways to generate different liquids, conventionally named as: whole blood, whole blood with EDTA or Citrate, blood plasma or blood serum. We find that the protein corona composition differ between these four different biological fluids. As the protein corona is important for target delivery, this will have implications for the in vitro evaluation of a target-specific nanoparticle system. \n\nWe also show that the ratio between particle surface area and biological macromolecules in a sample affect the composition of the corona. \n\nKnowledge about composition and dynamics of protein coronas is vital for the development of successful future nanoparticle-based medical applications. However, our current methods to analyze the corona may not be the optimal ones. In this paper, the limitations of the current methods are highlighted and the research fields is encouraged to find new suitable methods.",

            "text": "Protein adsorption onto the nanoparticle surface is one of the first events occurring when nanoparticles reach the blood stream. It has been found that plasma proteins such as albumin, apolipoprotein, complement, or fibrinogen can adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles and exhibit structural changes (Deng, Liang, Toth, Monteiro, & Minchin, 2013; Lee, Choi, Webster, Kim, & Khang, 2014). The adsorbed proteins depend on nanoparticle physicochemical properties such as size, shape, curvature, hydrophobicity, and surface charge, (Lundqvist et al., 2017) and on the composition of the biological media. The overall protein corona composition fluctuates with time due to proteins having different affinities to nanoparticles (Setyawati, Tay, Docter, Stauber, & Leong, 2015). The type and amount of proteins adsorbed on the nanoparticles influence the interactions of engineered nanomaterials with cells and their subsequent outcomes, playing an important role on nanoparticle biocompatibility (Aggarwal, Hall, McLeland, Dobrovolskaia, & McNeil, 2009;Fadeel, 2013). The adsorption of certain plasma proteins may induce adverse effects on the blood system such as imbalance of the coagulation cascade or complement activation (Dobrovolskaia, 2009). However, the mere presence of a specific protein on the particle surface does not imply that the biological function of that protein will be activated or changed (Dobrovolskaia et al., 2014;Mayer et al., 2009). For instance, complement and fibrinogen adsorption on nanoparticles does not lead to a level of depletion of these proteins, as they are highly abundant in plasma (Deng, Liang, Monteiro, Toth, & Minchin, 2011;Deng et al., 2013). \n\nOur review confirmed previous findings that had identified physicochemical properties such as size, surface charge, and surface chemistry as relevant for the observed alterations on the coagulation cascade (Ilinskaya & Dobrovolskaia, 2013) (Figure 9b).",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

And last but not the least, incorporation of imaging agents, together with the drug, offers the option of a theranostic approach, that is, it opens opportunities for treatment and target imaging at the same time [61\u2022].\n\nHowever, a key problem for many types of nanoparticles is the formation of a corona [62]. Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

The most tightly NP-bound proteins form the so-called hard corona (HC), the key bio-entity that determines the NP's biological identity and physiological response. To date, NP-HC has been almost exclusively characterized in vitro, while NP\u2013protein interactions under realistic in vivo conditions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we thoroughly characterized the in vivo HC of a NP formulation that forms around lipid nanoparticles with a lipid composition equal to that of clinically used liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\u00ae) after the recovery of the NPs from the blood circulation of FVB/N mice 10 minutes post intravenous administration. In vitro HC formed by 10 minutes incubation of NPs in FVB/N mouse plasma was used for comparison. Here we show that the biological identity (i.e. size, zeta-potential and aggregation state) of NPs in vivo is significantly different from that acquired in vitro. Furthermore, the variety of protein species in the in vivo HC was considerably larger. The present work has demonstrated that characterization of the in vivo HC is essential to provide an accurate molecular description of the biological identity of NPs in physiological environments.",

            "text": "The study of the protein corona, the immediate and evolving biomolecular coating that forms on the surface of nanoparticles when exposed to a biological environment, is a crucial area in nanomedicine. This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

            "text": "The interactions between nanoparticles and proteins have significant biological consequences to the original nanoparticle and to the native proteic environment. On the one hand, the formation of the protein corona on the nanoparticle surface changes the nanoparticle physicochemical properties. It changes the size, shape, and even the aggregation state of the nanoparticle, which in turn affects how proteins are oriented and presented to the biological targets [17]. On the other hand, interactions with nanoparticles may trigger protein aggregation or conformational changes, which may impact the protein functions and their interaction with other biomolecules, and may even result in an immune response to eliminate the circulating nanoparticles. In this regard, changes in protein stability and enzyme activity have been observed when immobilized on the nanoparticle surface [6]. \n\nUpon entrance in the biological media, nanoparticles are involved in a myriad of biological processes. The formation of the protein corona creates a different structure that will drive and influence the behavior and interaction of the nanoparticles with biological systems. Thus, the protein corona can alter the interactions of the nanoparticle with the cell surface moieties (e.g., antibodies), promoting or inhibiting the uptake of the nanoparticle by the cell [18]. For instance, in a case of study with silica nanoparticle, it was observed that the formation of the protein corona reduced the cell uptake by weakening their cell membrane adhesion [19]. The protein corona also plays an important role in targeting the nanoparticles to different organs [13]. \n\nThe biological impact of the nanoparticle interactions with proteins is particularly relevant in the development and use of the NPPC in biomedicine. The small size of nanoparticles gives them the ability to efficiently access cell compartments, which has important biomedical implications, leading to important developments in the field of nanomedicine [20,21]. The feature of the protein corona, which can direct the nanoparticles to specific organs or locations, can be used to design NPPC that can be placed anywhere desired in the organism or in the cell.",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "text": "In the last few decades, nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery platforms have improved the therapeutic index of many drugs. In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

            "text": "Using super-resolution optical microscopy (STORM), Feiner-Gracia et al. (2017) were able to visualize the protein corona formed on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity and found a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption within the same nanoparticle population. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that changes in the corona composition occurred over time due to the chemistry and degradability of the particles, thus adding a further level of complexity to our understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials (Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017). \n\nThe second, non-technical (and non-trivial) question refers to the biological \"meaning,\" if any, of all these proteins. It is well understood that the presence or absence of proteins, regardless of their identity, may influence the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles. The question is whether there is a role for specific proteins in the bio-corona? Tenzer et al. (2013) performed comprehensive studies using a panel of PS nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles of various sizes displaying different surface charges and could show that the rapid formation of a plasma protein corona could modulate distinct pathophysiological effects as evidenced by the ex vivo analysis of platelet activation/aggregation and red blood cell lysis (i.e., hemolysis). However, the complexity of the protein corona precluded the assignment of specific proteins to account for these effects (and perhaps the effects were related to a shielding of the particle surface, thereby passivating the nanoparticles) (see, e.g., Hu et al., 2011, Lesniak et al., 2012). Indeed, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles is mitigated in the presence of serum whereas ZnO nanoparticles that undergo rapid dissolution are cytotoxic both in the absence and presence of serum (Shi et al., 2012).",

Undoubtedly, this protein (biological macromolecule) can mask several physicochemical properties (such as the surface charge and solubility) of nanoparticles and make them recognizable to the immune system, which may neutralize them before they reach the target site [65]. The covering of nanoparticles with these proteins largely determines their biological identities and further fate-their distribution through tissues and organs, their rate of excretion from the body, and their opsonization (phagocytosis involving membrane receptors). This is the key factor causing differences in the performance of nanoparticles within in vitro and in vivo [66] studies, where nanoparticles indicate good results in the first case and usually are worse or non-effective in living organisms [67,68]. \n\nHowever, the composition, density, and mechanism of formation of this macromolecular layer depends not only on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles, association/dissociation constants, competitive binding processes, and species of proteins in the biological medium but also on where the nanoparticle is located [69,70]. \n\nThe formation of this protein corona depends not only on the composition of the nanoparticle-its size, shape, surface state, and exposure time-but also on the type of media, the nanoparticle-to-protein ratio, and the presence of ions and other molecular species that interfere in the interaction between proteins and nanoparticles [71]. \n\nCareful modulation of the protein corona through the tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters may allow nanoparticles to be delivered optimally in tumor tissue [72].",

Nanoparticles will rapidly adsorb proteins forming what is known as the protein \"corona\" after enters the circulation system. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would in uence the biological identity of nanoparticles [28] . The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29] . Understanding nanoparticle-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30] . The physiological environment to which nanoparticles are rst exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with nanoparticles to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing in ammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31] . \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases. This article focuses on polymer nanoparticles and explores their bioactivity impact on the development of AS and physiochemical mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study of the effects of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, which are widely used in a variety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapeutic devices, on the development of aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

            "text": "In recent years, significant advances have been made in the use of nanoparticles (NPs) in medical applications as a delivery system for therapeutics, particularly in the interaction between NPs and biological interfaces. When NPs enter the physiological environment, a protein corona surrounds them to create an interface with the cell, and the surface is controlled by a variety of physical forces: van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions. [271,272] The biological properties of NPs are affected by the protein corona, and the size, surface charge, and solubility of NPs determine the composition of the protein corona. Depending on the binding force between the protein and the nanoparticle, protein coronas are divided into soft coronas and hard coronas. [273] onopoli et al. demonstrated protein adsorption on different NP compositions, sulfonated polystyrene, and silica NPs, using physicochemical concepts to correlate studies of protein corona composition at different plasma concentrations with structural data from in situ and excess plasma-free complexes. [274] In this section, the binding of different proteins to nanoparticles following surface modification is exemplified in Figure 4. PEG is a common ingredient in drug delivery and is widely used for surface modification of NPs. Grenier et al. showed that anti-PEG immunoglobulins modified the settling of protein coronas through activation of the complement cascade and that immunoglobulin M binding to the PEGylated surface of NPs changed the properties of the proteins. [275] tudies have also investigated the effect of various serum proteins on surfaces with hydroxyl regulation using graphene/ gold as an example, evaluated the relationship between surface properties and protein coronas, and verified in mice that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) preadsorption enhances the ability of nanomaterials to survive prolonged blood circulation. [276] Fleischer et al. used polystyrene NPs functionalized with amine or carboxylate groups to create a cationic or anionic surface, while NPs exhibited different binding behaviors with cells after the adsorption of BSA.",

Although the role of some histidine rich glycoprotein (HRG) in prohibiting phagocytosis of nanoparticles with HRG enriched protein corona by macrophages was previously demonstrated 51 , the effect of protein C, which is also a glycoprotein, has remained unclear. \n\nTo better discuss the result of the test, Fig. 3 indicates the classification of hard corona composition for the PECs based on isoelectric point (pI, A), Mw (B), and physiological function (C) of the proteins. \n\nMost of the interacted proteins, due to their high abundance in serum, have the pI between 5 to 6 and the negative charge in pH of the serum. In hard corona, the portion of proteins with neutral and positive charges considerably increased in compare with FBS contents which affirms the non-electrostatic (pI, 7-8) and electrostatic interaction (pI, 8-10) between negatively charge nanoparticles and positively charge proteins, as mentioned about interaction of hemoglobin subunits.",

            "text": "24 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed, such as fetal bovine serum, human serum, or plasma, 27 and even in the same fluid, when the ratio between nanoparticle and fluid concentration is changed. 28 It has also been shown that the composition of this layer evolves over time or for instance during nanoparticle exposure to cells, because of adsorption of biomolecules secreted by cells in the medium. 21,22,29,30 Importantly, several studies have highlighted that the corona composition affects nanoparticle\u2212cell association 31 and that corona proteins can engage with specific cell receptors. 10,20,32,33 For instance, it has been shown that the uptake of silica nanoparticles is mediated by the recognition of corona proteins by the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. 10 However, it is not known yet whether the corona composition and the initial recognition of corona proteins by specific cell receptors also affect the following mechanism cells use to internalize the nanoparticles.\n\nTo this aim, in this work we characterized and compared the mechanisms of uptake of nanoparticles dispersed in media containing two very different serum concentrations, a high serum content close to protein concentration in blood (roughly 60 mg/mL) and a 5 times lower one. Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 nanoparticles) of 50 nm diameter were used as a representative model system to form different coronas in the two conditions. It is known that varying serum amount can lead to formation of different coronas. 28 Then, the effect of serum content on the uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was investigated, and common pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis were used in order to determine potential differences in the mechanisms of uptake in the two conditions. Next, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of the LDL receptor, here selected as a first illustrative example, given the previous reports on its involvement in the uptake of similar silica nanoparticles. 10 This allowed",

            "text": "The first principle of nanoparticle delivery to tumors posits that nanoparticles will interact with biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, and ions, after in vivo administration. Nanoparticles may also stick to cells in circulation. The most well-studied nanoparticle interactions are with serum proteins. A protein corona is called the layer of serum proteins that coats the nanoparticle surface [10,11]. We also use the term biological identity to describe the overall physicochemical properties of nanoparticles in biological media because there may be additional changes in the nanoparticle properties than the surfaceadsorbed proteins [12]. For example, the nanoparticle may agglomerate into multimers. A cell sees the protein corona and unique particle morphology. \n\nNanoparticles instantaneously adsorb serum proteins after intravenous administration to form a protein corona. The corona composition can change when they travel in the bloodstream until the proteins reach an exchange equilibrium on the nanoparticle surface [13,14]. Researchers theorize that the bound serum proteins mediate the nanoparticles' cellular interactions as they travel through the bloodstream. Chithrani et al. [15] provided the first reported impact of serum protein adsorption on nanoparticles and cellular uptake. They proposed that serum proteins would affect the size-dependent uptake of gold nanoparticles in cultured HeLa cells. They showed the serum protein presence on the nanoparticles by showing a shift in the agarose gel bands of nanoparticles incubated with and without serum. Cedervall et al. [16,17] used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to show that polystyrene nanoparticles bound many different serum proteins. They coined the term protein corona to describe the adsorbed proteins. They further described the corona as being hard or soft, referring to the strength of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. A hard corona usually has strong interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins, while a soft corona refers to nanoparticles that can readily adsorb and desorb from the surface. A soft corona can be called a transient protein corona.",

Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

            "text": "N anosized materials are widely investigated for their potential use as drug delivery systems thanks to their ability to distribute in the body and enter cells and the possibility to engineer them for multiple purposes. 1\u22123 Several nanomedicines are already on the market; however it is recognized that a better understanding of the mechanisms by which these objects are processed at organism and cell levels could contribute to further advance their clinical success. 4\u22126 In recent years, particular interest has been drawn on the impact of the biological environment in which nanomaterials are applied on their interactions at the organism and cellular level. Once in contact with a biological environment, nanosized objects immediately interact with the surrounding biomolecules, which can adsorb on the nanoparticle surface, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona. 7,8 Some of the biomolecules in this layer associate with the nanoparticle surface almost irreversibly, affecting de facto the subsequent behavior. For instance, it has been shown that the formation of the corona can affect nanomaterial stability and biodistribution, macrophage sequestration, immune system activation, cellular recognition, and nanomaterial final fate. 9\u221211 In some cases, the formation of a biomolecular corona can also affect the specificity of targeted drugs, by masking targeting ligands attached to the nanocarrier. 12,13 Polymers such as poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are usually grafted on the nanoparticle surface to partially reduce protein binding and subsequent macrophage sequestration. 14\u221216 However, recent work suggested that the so-called stealth effect is actually conferred by specific corona proteins adsorbed on PEGylated surfaces. 17 At the same time, researchers are also trying to exploit the biomolecular corona as a targeting strategy to direct nanoparticles toward specific cellular routes. 18\u221220 So far, corona formation and its composition have been widely investigated. 21\u221224 It is known that different nanoparticle properties such as size, charge, and shape can influence corona composition, and this can lead to different cellular responses to nanomaterials. 8,25,26 The corona composition also varies depending on the nature of the biological fluids in which nanoparticles are dispersed",

Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function.

The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

            "text": "In the study, we showed that both the total amount of proteins and the number of protein species associated with the liposomes in plasma depend little on the bilayer composition thereof (liquid ordered or disordered phase of neutral or anionic bilayer). However, changes in the lipid composition led to a considerable shift in relative abundances of the proteins in the coronas, which affects liposome integrity in the presence of plasma proteins. We confirmed the positive effect of cholesterol in liposomes on their stability in plasma. Cholesterol somewhat improved the liposome recognition by neutrophils as well, which at least partially depended on the protein corona composition. Overall, the effect of the differences in the lipid bilayer and protein corona compositions on the liposome uptake by cells was negligible. \n\nExpanding the array of basic liposome compositions to investigate their protein coronas and correlating the results with the in vivo data should be the next steps of the research. Exploring the roles of individual proteins found to be differentially bound on the liposomes would also contribute to our understanding of the protein corona effects on liposome carriers and it would improve the design of the new ones.",

            "text": "s as the surface was saturated with a high amount of adsorbed proteins (Table S1, Supporting Information). There were no significant differences in the surface charges after corona formation of the various nanoparticles, which was also reported in the literature. 41 In order to understand the reason for the inhibited cellular uptake of protein-coated NCs, the composition of protein corona was further analyzed. The corona pre-formed SiNCs were centrifuged to remove the loosely bound proteins, which comprise the \"soft corona\". The proteins adsorbed on SiNC surfaces were desorbed and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 5A). The silver-stained gel revealed different \"hard corona\" patterns for the 7 different SiNCs. Some small proteins in the size of 6-16 kDa were only found in the corona of NC(i)-LUT with and without NH 2 -functionalization. These results indicate that the physicochemical properties of the NCs had a strong effect on corona composition. Furthermore, the total protein amount adsorbed per m 2 SiNC was calculated ( Figure 5B). The NC(o) had a higher amount of protein adsorbed on the surface compared to NC(i). In our previous work we showed by NMR that the oil-water exchange results in further hydrolysis of the alkoxysilanes. 42 Therefore, this process has an influence on the silica network. Based on this, we assume that NC(i) are more hydrophilic compared to NC(o), which affects the adsorption of blood proteins. In literature, it was shown that a hydrophobic surface of nanoparticles also results in an increased adsorption of proteins compared to a hydrophilic surface. 42 Among the hydrophilic core, NC(i)-CTAC had the highest amount of protein adsorbed. It can be observed that the protein amount was decreased with increasing NH 2 -functionalization.\n\nIn \"hard corona\", proteins were analyzed by LC-MS. Proteins involved in the coagulation cascade (e.g. histidinerich glycoprotein, kininogen, plasminogen, and vitronectin) were the dominant protein group for all SiNCs ( Figure 5C and D",

A spectrum of technologies enables nanoparticles to be manufactured and engineered with a specific synthetic (material-intrinsic) identity including rational coating of their surface to facilitate specific applications including tissue targeting in biomedical applications [10][11][12][13] (see Table 1, column 2). For example, nanoparticles that have been covalently linked to macromolecules such as polyethylene glycol, antibodies, or peptides are designed to ensure desirable levels of solubility, stability, or biological activity in drug delivery (Table 1, columns 1-3).  One of the major aims in manipulating the surface properties of nanoparticles is to control their targeting and pharmacokinetics properties which are necessary for efficacious drug delivery [24,25]. When exposed to a physiological environment, such as the blood, nanoparticles interact with components of their environment. It is known that proteins in the blood convert naked nanoparticles into nanoparticles with a surface protein coat called a \"protein corona\" [26][27][28][29] (see Figure 1). The formation of a protein corona on nanoparticles is mediated by mutual electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking.

As pioneers of clinically approved drug delivery vehicles, liposomes still represent attractive carriers due to their biocompatibility [5], robust technologies of production [6], and versatility. Precise knowledge of the laws regarding the formation of protein corona and its effects on clinical outcomes could provide guidance for Membranes 2023, 13, 681 2 of 23 the entire field of nanomedicine. Nevertheless, studies on the protein corona of lipid-based nanoparticles are considerably underrepresented in nanobiointerface research [7]. \n\nIn early works, the liposome circulation time was shown to be dependent on the lipid composition, which determines the fluidity and surface charge of the bilayer [8]. Fluid-phase liposomes have long been known to be rapidly cleared from circulation, which correlated with rather high amounts of bound plasma proteins [8] (this has kept the interest in fluid phase-based liposomes as drug vehicles relatively low). The integrity of liposomes in the presence of plasma proteins due to the robustness of the solid-phase (and even more so liquid ordered-phase) bilayer does have a flip side, namely slower intracellular processing [9]; neither was it found to be beneficial for hydrophobic drugs incorporated in the lipid bilayer of liposomes, which escape solid phase-based liposomes in the plasma more easily [10]. While some negatively charged lipids increase protein binding (PB) by liposomes and, thus, decrease the clearance time, phosphatidylglycerol affects the clearance but not the PB value [11].",

            "text": "Another issue is the lack of standardized protocols for physicochemical and biological characterization of nanomaterials, as well as lack of a universally agreed upon definition of a nanomaterial [203]. Due to these limitations, generic protocols have been employed for characterization during the early stages of R&D, which explains the huge numbers of failures in terms of clinical translation of the final nano-based therapies [204]. To overcome the abovementioned hurdles, a closer collaboration between regulatory agencies, scientific experts in material science, pharmacology and toxicology is needed. Capacity for largescale manufacturing is another hurdle that needs to be overcome for broader commercialization of nano-based formulations [32,205]. \n\nDue to the multifaceted interactions between nanomaterials and biological systems (in vivo), it is very challenging to foresee the behaviour of these materials under physiological conditions. Once within the body, the nanoparticles reach the blood circulation, which is a very complex matrix containing ions, small molecules, proteins, and cells [206]. It is already known that nanoparticles are able to interact with biomolecules, mainly proteins, resulting in the formation of protein corona [207]. The composition of protein corona is mainly driven by the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. In other words, it is unique for each nanoparticulate system and influenced by several factors. Both proteinnanoparticle interaction and protein-protein interaction regulate the adsorption of protein on the surfaces of nanoparticles [207]. The formation of protein corona modifies the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, consequently giving them a new biological identity, which is more significant in determining the biological response than the original properties of the nanoparticles [208]. Therefore, the characterization of protein corona is an essential step to be investigated in the process of nanomedicine development.",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

            "text": "It is well known that nanomaterials can interact with various biomolecules of living organisms, primarily with proteins that are able to adsorb on the nanoparticles surface, forming the biomolecular corona [82]. About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly prevalent in our society, with applications ranging from nanomedicine, photovoltaics, cosmetics and beyond. Despite the ubiquity of their use, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how NPs interact with their local environments. This poor understanding becomes a critical problem when using NPs in real-life situations. Notably, it has been well documented that introducing NPs into biological fluids results in the formation of a surrogated biological identity known as the biomolecular corona, which is the spontaneous adsorption of proteins 1 , lipids 2 , sugar moieties 3 , nucleic acids 4 and metabolites 5,6 onto nanomaterial surfaces. The composition of the biomolecular corona strongly determines the ultimate fate of NPs [7][8][9] . As most studies that address the biomolecular corona formation have focused on proteins adsorbed to the surface of NPs 10 , together with the fact that the predominant model for the formation of the biomolecular corona is hegemonized by the direct adsorption of proteins from biological milieus 11 , this Review comprehensively focuses on the protein corona. \n\nThe emergence of the concept of the protein corona in nanomedicine substantially altered perspectives of researchers and interpretation of biosystem-NP interactions. The first critical milestone occurred in 2007 when Dawson's group conceived the term protein corona 12 . However, protein corona studies commenced as early as the late 1950s 13 and early 1960s 14,15 under a slightly different terminology and a colloidal science context. The characterization of protein coronas has revealed that the adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials can have mixed biological effects. Protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and the complexities of biological matrices, can unpredictably change NP outcomes including function 16 , uptake 17,18 , biodistribution 19,20 , immunological responses 10,21 and toxicity 22,23 , and can thus be a challenge for therapeutic nanomedicine.",

            "text": "In vivo, lipid vectors for drug delivery adsorb proteins, lipids and other plasmatic biomolecules on their surface in a non-specific manner once injected: depending on the nanoparticles' properties, such as their charge, hydrophilicity, dimensions and morphology, the several components present in plasma interact and build a coating. The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

            "text": "The use of nanoparticles (NPs) for drug delivery allows for the manipulation of such parameters as the solubility of hydrophobic compounds in water, their circulation and halflife time, the conditions and rate of release of the active compound from the dosage form, the possibility of simultaneous delivery of two or more drugs, and immunogenicity. Currently, there are a number of NP-based drugs on the pharmaceutical market [1,2]. The clinical application of nanopreparations reflects the high achievements of nanobiotechnologies, but there is still no complete clarity regarding what happens to nanoparticles when they enter the body. First, this concerns the formation of the so-called biomolecular corona around the NPs in physiological media, the main components of which are protein molecules [3][4][5]. \n\nSorption of proteins from the surrounding physiological environment onto the surface of NPs serves as the main driver of protein corona formation; and it depends on both the physicochemical parameters of the NPs (size, surface curvature, presence and type of charge, surface hydrophobicity) and the properties of the protein molecules, which, in turn, are largely determined by the protein structure [6][7][8]. \n\nThe duration of corona proteins' residence on the particle surface varies. Proteins whose residence time significantly exceeds the duration of the experiment form a socalled \"hard corona\" [9]. Hard corona proteins bind to the NP surface almost irreversibly; hard-corona-bearing NPs can be isolated, and their corona protein composition can be determined [10,11]. Along with the proteins of the hard corona, which are tightly bound to the NPs' surface, there are proteins with low affinity to the surface, which form an extremely variable layer-the \"soft corona\", the composition of which easily changes under the influence of environmental factors [9]. \n\nThe high instability of the soft corona, determined by its dynamic nature, makes the task of isolating soft-corona-bearing NPs difficult to achieve. Only a few studies have been published on the isolation of full-corona-bearing NPs and determination of the protein composition of both the hard and soft corona [12,13].",

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

            "text": "Opsonization remains one of the most commonly discussed biological obstacles known to impact the translation of nanoparticles from animal models to the clinical setting [17]. The dynamic process of binding and exchange of plasma proteins associated with the nanomaterial surface has been demonstrated to play a key role in the clinical translation of materials. It has been shown that some protein modifications produce improved cellular uptake at the tumor site [18], whereas others induce immune responses leading to clearance via the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) [15]. Several opsonin components have been identified, including complement proteins [15], apolipoproteins [10], and various metabolites [19], with the adsorption of specific constituents or ratios being responsible for stealth effects (or lack thereof) in PEG-based materials [10]. The combination of nanoparticle-protein [20] and protein-protein [21] interactions leads to a vast array of different protein corona composition. Numerous physicochemical factors have been shown to contribute to the accumulation and subsequent composition of the protein corona including chemical composition [22], size [23], curvature [22], rigidity [24], hydrophobicity [22], presence of protein targeting ligands [25], and surface characteristics [10,11,26]. These factors contribute to the unpredictable outcome of interactions between nanoparticles and physiological phenomena, with enhanced variability also arising due to flow rate encountered in different parts of the animal [27], enzymatic modifications [12], glycosylation state [28], as well as localized plasma protein concentration [27] and content [12] within anatomical regions. While the interaction with blood proteins has been profiled for certain kinds of materials (e.g., gold nanoparticles [29] and liposomes [30]), proteomic fingerprinting has not been done for polymeric nanomedicines (at least under conditions that match those present within the blood stream of an animal). This is due to difficulty in extracting intact complexes and the fragility of the soft corona [14].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles' physicochemical properties control the formation and composition of the protein corona. Whereas the extent of the impact of each property on the protein corona composition and disposition is not completely understood, there is an extended consensus that no nanoparticle property alone drives the formation of the corona, but all of them together [23]. Nanoparticle protein adsorptions are mainly driven by non-covalent forces, affinity constants of proteins and protein structure thermodynamics [24]. Thus, the nanoparticle surface constitutes a major factor influencing the protein corona [25]. In contrast to the previously commented direct influence of nanoparticle surface charge in the toxicity and biodistribution of nanoparticles, this parameter does not seem to be so influential on the formation and eventual biological effect of NPPC [22,25]. \n\nThe hydrophobicity of a nanoparticle's surface is, on the contrary, a significant factor limiting the amount and identity of the proteins bound to the nanoparticle. In this regard, for instance, Lynch et al. found that when plasma is incubated with low hydrophobic copolymer particles, virtually no protein is retrieved, while significant amounts of protein are consistently bound to hydrophobic particles [26]. Nanoparticle surface chemistry is also a driving parameter in the formation of the characteristics of the protein corona, as it controls the number of possible binding sites [12]. Nanoparticles commonly need to be functionalized with ligands and biomolecules that affect their solubility, stability, and define and control their biocompatibility and biological interactions [27]. This functionalization eventually affects the formation of the protein corona (because it largely confers a stealth character on the nanoparticle, protecting it and making it inaccessible to proteins) and could be crucial when developing nanoparticles with biological or therapeutical applications [28].",

            "text": "The growing risk of human exposure to airborne nanoparticles (NPs) causes a general concern on the biosafety of nanotechnology. Inhaled NPs can deposit in the deep lung at which they interact with the pulmonary surfactant (PS). Despite the increasing study of nano-bio interactions, detailed molecular mechanisms by which inhaled NPs interact with the natural PS system remain unclear. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we studied the interaction between NPs and the PS system in the alveolar fluid. It was found that regardless of different physicochemical properties, upon contacting the PS, both silver and polystyrene NPs are immediately coated with a biomolecular corona that consists of both lipids and proteins. Structure and molecular conformation of the PS corona depend on the hydrophobicity of the pristine NPs. Quantitative analysis revealed that lipid composition of the corona formed on different NPs is relatively conserved and is similar to that of the bulk phase PS. However, relative abundance of the surfactant-associated proteins, SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C, is notably affected by the hydrophobicity of the NP. The PS corona provides the NPs with a physicochemical barrier against the environment, equalizes the hydrophobicity of the pristine NPs, and may enhance biorecognition of the NPs. These modifications in physicochemical properties may play a crucial role in affecting the biological identity of the NPs and hence alter their subsequent interactions with cells and other biological entities. Our results suggest that all studies of inhalation nanotoxicology or NP-based pulmonary drug delivery should consider the influence of the PS corona.",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules. The formation of a corona effectively coats the molecules and consequently deactivates the ability of nanoparticles to recognise cell receptors.\n\nThe molecular composition of a corona can also promote binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane and consequently enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. 27 For example, a corona composed of multiple biomolecules (i.e. proteins like prothrombin, antithrombin III, vitronectin, intera-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain H5, platelet factor 4 and apolipoprotein H) promoted cellular uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles in human cervical carcinoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. 27 Corona was also shown to enhance cellular uptake of Janus gold-iron oxide and polystyrene nanoparticles in human vascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 30,31 While the rapid formation of a corona on nanoparticles is known to in\ue104uence their interactions with cells, there is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The properties of such a particle-protein complex differ significantly from those of the formulated particle. Hence, the further biological responses of the body as well as the biodistribution of the nanoparticles are expected to be influenced by the nanoparticle-protein complex [34]. Therefore, the PLA nanoparticles were incubated with human blood plasma for several time points and we examined the binding of plasma proteins to the nanoparticles. The protein binding profiles were visualized by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that an exposure for five minutes was already sufficient for an efficient corona formation ( Figure 7A). Also, the amount of corona proteins increased over time, albeit the corona seems to change only quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Furthermore, we examined the presence of apolipoproteins in the protein corona ( Figure 7B). Apolipoproteins are part of the circulating lipoproteins and serve as receptor ligands for lipid and cholesterol uptake and metabolism, and it was suggested that apolipoprotein-modified nanoparticles are able to transport drugs across the BBB [35][36][37][38]. We observed that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) are already present in the nanoparticle-protein complex after five minutes of exposure, and that the amount of ApoA4 slightly decreased and the ApoE concentrations significantly increased over time. The formation of the apolipoprotein corona on the PLA nanoparticles indicates a potential transport route of the nanoparticles through a lipoprotein receptor transcytosis pathway [37,39].",

Notably, similar results are observed when above nanoparticles\u2019 PEGylated lipid bilayer shell is changed to be non-PEGylated.

Nanoparticles covered by biomolecular corona exhibit altered physiochemical and functional characteristics which give them new biological identities [53]. The proteins surrounding nanoparticles can either mitigate or stimulate immune responses, or alternatively they may induce pathological and physiological changes [54]. Protein corona is considered to be a major factor that limits nanoparticle-targeted delivery, as it reduces the targeting capability in vivo [55]. Several strategies have been developed to mitigate the effects of biological fluids including blood nanoparticle's functionality. For example, func-tionalizing copper sulphide NPs with the glycan-binding protein jacalin reduces protein corona interference and enhances the targeting ability of the NP via microbial cell surface glycan recognition. This results in substantially higher antimicrobial activity compared to pristine nanoparticles [56]. \n\nNanoparticle-based targeted antimicrobial therapies use a range of delivery systems based on metals, liposomes or lipids, mesoporous silica materials or polymers [57][58][59][60]. Antibacterial-targeted nanoparticles may possess inherent antimicrobial activities, or they may carry therapeutic payloads such as antibiotics [61]. The cell envelope surrounding bacteria acts as a physical barrier, which prevents the accumulation and internalization of antibiotic molecules within bacteria [61]. Silica NPs containing gluconamide-targeting moieties have improved binding affinity to Gram-negative bacteria cell membranes [62]. Therefore, the use of nanoparticles for targeted antimicrobial therapies offers a promising solution to targeted therapies, although substantially more work is required in this field to further refine the nanoparticle therapies.",

For simulation work prior to 2020, previous review papers are highly recommended [36][37][38]. Here, we review the structure, dynamics, and composition of the protein corona on nanoparticles (Section 2), the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation (Section 3), the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on protein corona formation (Section 4), and interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with a protein corona (Section 5). In each section, all-atom, coarse-grained (CG), and mesoscale simulations are reviewed separately to highlight their specific roles at different simulation scales.",

The molecular mechanism underlying the protein resistance of grafted with PEG are still not fully understood, 45 but a brush-induced steric repulsion preventing contact between proteins and the underlying surface, or the hydration shell surrounding PEG moieties, which suppresses adsorption of proteins, are considered as the two dominating mechanisms. 46 However, complete inhibition of corona formation remains a challenge, 47 as PEG chains on a nanoparticle's surface function as a waterbinding hydrogel-like brush, with protein-resistant properties that are highly dependent on the length, flexibility, and density of the PEG chains. 45 A recent class of nanoparticles has been fabricated by combining synthetic cores with a biologically derived membrane coating, including those derived from red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, white blood cells, cancer cells, and bacteria, has attracted attention. 48 ome of these cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles have a significant increase in their circulatory half-life, 48,49 or have the ability to better target a region of interest. 50 Each of these biomimetic nanoparticles has its own set of unique characteristics that are derived from the versatility and complexity of the cellular membrane used in their synthesis. 51,52 s a consequence, these biomimetic nanoparticles with natural surface properties are very different from synthetic nanoparticles that have a chemically modified surface, as the interface of biomimetic nanoparticles and biological systems that exist within the body is biocompatible including natural protein-protein interactions.",

The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

It has become clear that slight changes in the physicochemical properties of NPs have significant biological implications. Most NPs that come into contact with biological materials are coated by a wide variety of proteins, which is named the \"protein corona.\" One component of the NP corona (called opsonins) can enhance the NP uptake by the RES. Under physiologic conditions, the corona may alter the NP properties by masking its surface characteristics [9,10]. e exposure time in the blood circulation has been recognized as a key factor that shapes the NP biomolecular corona; furthermore, the new properties that are imparted to the NPs by the corona are the main factor that controls the distribution, nanotoxicity, and the therapeutic effect of NPs in the body [11] (Figure 2). Some studies have suggested that the formation of the protein corona is an undesirable process; however, others have discussed the advantages of this formation, such as reducing the cytotoxic effect, eliminating undesirable interactions with the immune system, and facilitating cellular internalization [12]. e protein corona might reduce the targeting capability of the NPs by shielding the recognition site of the targeting ligands from the receptors [13]. Different disease types can have different effects on the corona composition, because for every disease, there are different types of proteins secreted in the body, and these proteins may affect the corona composition around the NPs [14]. ese considerations mean that patients with different types of cancer may have specific types of coronas [14]. is has led some authors to introduce a new concept for NP targeting called a \"personalized protein corona\" (PPC) [15], wherein precise information on corona composition is a must to produce optimum personalized nanomedicines for therapy and diagnosis of every type of cancer. Colapicchioni et al. [16] investigated whether the pathological alteration of plasma proteins influenced the protein corona. ey incubated liposomes with the plasma taken from patients with confirmed breast, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. e NPs were then isolated by centrifugation, and they found that the hard corona varied",

These unique properties also have significant effects on the composition and structure of the protein corona formed around these NPs in a biological environment. Herein, protein corona formation on albumin NPs and liposomes was simultaneously evaluated through in vitro and simulation studies. The sizes of both types of NPs increased with more negatively charged interfaces upon being introduced into fetal bovine serum. Gel electrophoresis and label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to identify proteins recruited to the hard corona, and fewer proteins were found in albumin NPs than in liposomes, which is in accordance with isothermal titration calorimetry. The cellular uptake efficiency of the two NPs significantly differed in different serum concentrations, which was further scrutinized by loading an anticancer compound into albumin NPs. The presence of the hard protein corona increased the cellular uptake of albumin NPs in comparison with liposomes. In our simulation study, a specific receptor present in the membrane was greatly attracted to the albumin-apolipoprotein E complex. Overall, this study not only evaluated protein corona formation on albumin NPs, but also made promising advancements toward albumin- and liposome-based therapeutic systems.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a biological fluid, such as serum, proteins and peptides adsorb onto the particle's surface, forming a nanoparticle-protein corona (NPPC) complex [1][2][3]. The protein cloud develops a new surface on the nanoparticle, impacting the interactions between the nanoparticle and the surrounding environment. The NPPC complex assumes the characteristics of a core-shell particle system, where the pristine particle is the \"core\" and the corona is the \"shell\" [4]. This creates a new interface between the pristine particle and the surrounding biological fluid. The formation of a protein corona has been shown to change the particle's biological effects [5][6][7][8]. In addition to this change in the particle's characteristics, the adsorbed proteins have the potential to undergo conformational changes. Changes in either set of properties are especially important for nanomaterial drug products [9][10][11][12][13]. The cloak of proteins around particles in biological fluids has been shown to enhance or diminish a particle's specificity to a desired location, incite or inhibit its ability to permeate into a cell, and heighten or mitigate a biochemical response. When a protein corona forms, it is more likely to distribute and become available due to the nano-bio interface that forms around the surface of the nanoparticle. This protein cloud can change the biodistribution of the nanoparticle system depending on the biomolecular composition formed around the surface. Consequently, if the drug is reliant on specific proteins binding to the surface of the nanoparticle, then the particle could be translocated into an unintended location if non-targeted proteins form around the particle. \n\nResearch efforts in the field of nanotoxicology have strived to relate (or correlate) particle properties to adverse health effects. There now exists a substantial amount of published literature on this topic; however, there is no general consensus on identifying physicochemical characteristics as predictors of toxicological responses.",

            "text": "The liposomes used here, have a more negative zeta potential compared to the EVs. This could rise the question, if the difference in protein corona observed between liposomes and EVs is due to the difference in zeta potential. However, the protein corona of the two differently charged liposomes was almost identical. Therefore, we conclude that the zeta potential of the liposomes plays a minor role for their protein corona composition and the difference in protein corona composition between EVs and liposomes is not mainly caused by the difference in zeta potential. \n\nAs observed for liposomes before, the EVs used in this study showed an enhanced uptake in phagocytic cell types after protein corona adsorption. We therefore investigated if the high amount of immunoglobulins representing known opsonins would explain the higher uptake. In the 33% DOPE liposome protein corona, we also found immunoglobulins but fewer complement proteins. Instead, apolipoproteins and serum albumin were enriched, which are known as dysopsonins. However, the dysopsonizing proteins could not ameliorate the opsonizing effect of immunoglobulins. Overall, the protein coronas of 33% DOPE liposomes and EVs had opsonizing properties as cell uptake into phagocytes was increased upon protein corona adsorption. \n\nComparing our results to Mateos-Maroto et al., also stresses the importance of investigating human plasma-derived protein coronas for targeting of human cell lines when developing drug delivery vehicles (Mateos-Maroto et al., 2023). In contrast to our results, they found that an FBS-derived protein corona decreased the uptake of liposomes in murine macrophage cells. For liposomes, it has been known for decades that rapid blood-clearance is a major problem for clinical applicability and surface modifications are used to prolong blood circulation times (Shen et al., 2018). This is in good accordance with our finding, that the protein corona on non-functionalized liposomes enhances uptake in monocytes. Furthermore, this raises the question if EVs would also need stealth modifications to reach their full delivery potential.",

It plays an important role in the colloidal stability of NPs, which is of importance for most of their medical applications and toxicity assessment. While typical studies use either blood plasma or serum from a pooled biobank, it is unclear whether differences in the media, such as cholesterol level or protein concentration, might affect the NP colloidal stability and corona composition. In this study, the silica corona was prepared at particularly low plasma concentrations (3%, v/v\u20131.98 mg/mL) to identify the critical roles of the protein mass/NP surface ratio and the level of plasma cholesterol on the corona protein pattern and particle stability. While depending on the plasma dilution factor, the corona protein composition could be controlled by keeping the protein/NP constant. The NP colloidal stability was found to strongly correlate with the level of cholesterol in human plasma, particularly due to the high enrichment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the corona. A cohort study on plasma samples from individuals with known cholesterol levels was performed to highlight that association, which could be relevant for all corona systems enriched with the LDL.",

We find that preadsorbed Chy on the surface of AuNPs results in a protein corona with enriched immunoglobulins and reduced human serum albumin protein, which further affect the polarization of macrophages into specific phenotypes.

            "text": "Furthermore, we examined the protein corona profiles of our most effective ILs to gain insights into their targeting mechanisms. Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "the quantity of proteins taken up over time [27]. Those are areas warranting research as the proteins on the corona are susceptible to posttranslational modifications, including the binding of lipids and carbohydrates.\n\nThe non-cellular blood interactome is likely to be host-specific and capable of modifying pathogen infectivity. How does this explain individual susceptibility to disease? Currently, it is impossible to answer this question. Blood protein composition may be influenced by innate factors such as age, nutritional status, genetics, immune competence, and underlying chronic diseases, and by extrinsic factors such as drug use, lifestyle, and geographic origin [112]. These factors could influence the composition of the host-specific non-cellular interactome of the pathogen. Changes in protein corona composition have been documented with artificial nanoparticles [112,113]. Proteins' conformation may change in many diseases [113], potentially altering the blood interactome of the pathogen. Like the proposal of a \"personalized\" protein corona which affects nanoparticles' biochemistry and biology [112,113], we anticipate that the pathogen enters the host and circulates in association with a host-specific (\"personalized\") non-cellular blood interactome. Hypothetically, the blood proteome and metabolome may differ in different disease states consistent with a state-specific blood interactome that forms the basis for the state-and host-specific acquired pathogen's biocorona. State-specific post-translational modifications of blood proteins may affect the pathogen-associated non-cellular interactome. Proteins surrounding the pathogen surface may undergo misfolding and aggregation (protein unfolding has been reported in studies with artificial nanoparticles [114]). Pathogen-protein interactions may induce the exposure of hidden protein epitopes (as happens with nanoparticle-denatured proteins [28,114]). This could enhance immunological responses and/or induce unwanted inflammatory responses. We postulate that the host-specific non-cellular blood interactome is an important external variable that can render the host susceptible or resilient to infectious diseases. Recognition of the non-cellular blood interactome as an innate immune response could help explain why an infectious agent that is virulent in one setting may be mild",

Adsorption of proteins like fibrinogen or ribonuclease A to nanomaterials can also lead to destabilisation of their structure, e.g. by partial unfolding altering their function and promoting particle aggregation. [56][57][58] This does not seem to be a universal process. For instance, protein adsorption on nanoparticles with high curvature actually improves protein stability and retains enzymatic functions, for example, for soy bean peroxidase, lysozyme and human carbonic anhydrase. 56 Pre-coating of nanoparticles with a single protein-like albumin has been shown to increase colloidal stability and reduce binding of opsonins (C3, IgGs), consequently reducing nanoparticle uptake by macrophages. 59 Protein coating of nanomaterials can also be further exploited for the attachment and proteolytic release of drugs. 60,61 An increasing number of studies have revealed that the composition and presence of a protein corona is dependent on the nanoparticle size, charge, shape, surface functionalization and incubation time. 54,[62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71] While most studies have suggested a limited complexity of protein coronas of several dozens of proteins, a recent quantitative proteomic study identified up to 300 different proteins in the protein corona of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles. 68 Protein adsorption from serum occurred within minutes and the corona composition changed little with prolonged exposure time. In addition, the authors observed that the particle net charge after corona formation was negative independent of the initial particle charge. 68,69 The great majority of studies have",

            "text": "To further investigate the protein corona composition, proteins are typically separated and desorbed from purified protein-nanoparticle complexes. We utilized the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method by cutting protein gel bands and then performing protein sequencing using LC-MS/MS, which allows for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of PCs (Figure 3). The current mechanisms underlying how the protein corona affects cell metabolism are not yet clear. It is known that proteins in the corona on nanoparticles can interact with other biomolecules inside and outside the cells. The intracellular protein corona regulates the macrophage phenotype and induces stress responses in endothelial cells. We believe that intercellular proteins replace some proteins from the surface of nanoparticles, disrupting protein homeostasis, subsequently triggering the \"Neutrophil activation involved in immune response\", \"Respiratory vesicle lumen\", \"Cytoplasmic vesicle lumen\", and \"Secretory granule lumen\" pathways (Figure 4). The PC-induced neutrophils impact the cellular clearance pathways of nanoparticles and alter cell metabolism. Currently, the targeted delivery of nanomedicines still presents significant challenges. Research by Wilhelm et al. has shown that only 0.7% of nanomaterials can be effectively transported to specific target sites [25]. Ideally, drugs should be enriched in target organs while minimizing accumulation in other tissues. However, in most cases, the formation of the protein corona weakens the targeting ability of nanomaterials. This is because the PC covers the surface of the nanomaterial carrying ligands, creating a barrier between the ligands and target cells, impeding their mutual recognition and reducing targeting efficiency. Therefore, in the follow-up experiments, we will knock out or inhibit proteins such as F-actin, Coronin, vATPase, TUBA, TUBB, MHCII, and TSP to elucidate the impact of these protein coronas on the mechanism of cellular phagocytosis.",

Experimental and theoretical studies have mostly focused on modulating the size, structure, and surface properties of nanoparticles, in order to increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles [6][7][8][9][10]. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins and, thus, their surfaces are often covered by multiple protein layers, a process called protein corona [11,12]. The formation of protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles, which can significantly increase or decrease the targeting efficiency and cytotoxicity via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles and cell membranes [11, [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The mechanism of protein corona formation and the effect of protein corona on nanoparticle properties and interactions with cell membranes need to be studied at nearly the atomic scale in order to understand this and complement relevant experiments, as can be done using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the system containing multiple plasma proteins and nanoparticles is too large to simulate using all-atom models, theoretical studies, such as kinetic mean-field theory (MFT), density functional theory (DFT), and monte carlo (MC) simulations have been mainly performed until 2000s, but advances on computer power and force-field development make it possible to perform MD simulations of the nanoparticle complexed with plasma proteins for the past decade. Figure 1 shows that citations for research papers regarding MD simulations under the topic of protein corona have drastically increased, which will be thoroughly reviewed here, with a focus on plasma proteins, but not on other molecules, such as peptides and synthetic polymers. Zhdanov's review paper is highly recommended for MFT, DFT, and MC simulations of protein corona on nanoparticles [19]. In this review, we aim to show that MD simulations can successfully predict the experimentally observed compositions and structures of protein corona and their interactions with lipid membranes, as.",

            "text": "When nanoparticle delivery systems are immersed in biological fluids, a complex assembly of proteins forms on their surface, creating a protein corona. The protein corona alters the physicochemical properties, toxicity, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and immune response of the nanoparticles, and consequently, their therapeutic efficacy. Currently, there is a lack of in vitro methods to assess the effects of the protein corona on nanoparticle uptake under dynamic flow and assess their binding kinetics in real-time. Here, we introduce quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) as an in vitro technique, capable of incorporating dynamic flow, to study the effect of the protein corona on the binding of nanoliposome (NLP) formulations to cell surfaces as a first step in their cellular uptake. The interactions of four NLP formulations (low PEGylated, high PEGylated, negatively charged and positively charged NLPs) with A375 melanoma and THP1 cell lines were assessed by QCM-D, before and after the formation of a protein corona. Through real-time recording of the frequency and dissipation shifts (\u0394f and \u0394D, respectively), the QCM-D results provided strong evidence of the role of the protein corona in the cellular interaction of these NLP formulations, with a variation in their adsorption kinetics depending on their initial composition. NLP's attachment to the cell surface was the lowest for PEGylated NLPs (<5%), while the positively charged NLPs showed the highest cellular attachment (\u2248100%), regardless of the presence of the protein corona or cell type. The effect of the protein corona was more pronounced for the negatively charged NLPs, where a significant reduction in the NLP attachment was observed. To complement the QCM-D data on the NLP attachment and to determine whether the NLP attachment leads to cellular uptake, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used to confirm NLP uptake by A375 and THP1 cells. Proteomic analysis revealed a differential composition of the protein corona on the various NLPs with possible implications for their sequestration and cellular uptake. Collectively, the findings suggest that QCM-D can be an important",

For this purpose, it describes general concepts to control (guide/minimize) the interaction between artificial nanoparticles and plasma proteins to reduce protein corona formation. Thereafter, methods for the qualitative or quantitative determination of protein corona formation are presented, as well as the properties of nanoparticle surfaces, which are relevant for protein corona prevention (or formation). Thereby especially the role of grafting density of hydrophilic polymers on the surface of the nanoparticle is discussed to prevent the formation of a protein corona. In this context also the potential of detergents (surfactants) for a temporary modification as well as grafting\u2010to and grafting\u2010from approaches for a permanent modification of the surface are discussed. The review concludes by highlighting several promising avenues. This includes (i) the use of nanoparticles without protein corona for active targeting, (ii) the use of synthetic nanoparticles without protein corona formation to address the immune system, (iii) the recollection of nanoparticles with a defined protein corona after in vivo application to sample the blood proteome and (iv) further concepts to reduce protein corona formation.",

            "text": "We initially determined that PLGA nanoparticles enter the body as foreign objects, triggering an in ammatory response in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. These nanoparticles were then engulfed by macrophages, migrated to sites of in ammation and eventually aggravated the formation of plaque. \n\nDuring the injection process, nanoparticles are rapidly coated with macromolecules forming a \"protein crown or corona (PC)\", which alters the size, aggregation state, surface charge and interfacial properties of the nanomaterials to create a biological identity that is distinct from its original synthetic identity. PLGA nanoparticles adsorbed a certain amount of proteins to form the PLGA + PC, with larger diameter and less stability, after incubation with mouse serum. Nanoparticles with protein coronas show completely different cell recognition or biological effects in vitro compared with in vivo [30] . \n\nMacrophages are the most important in ammatory cells in the process of AS lesion formation, are important components of lipid plaques, and serve as an important source of foam cells [40] . Therefore, we studied the effects of PLGA nanoparticles on macrophages in vitro. According to the MTS assay results, the activity of Raw 264.7 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of PLGA nanoparticles and PLGA + PC. The presence of the protein corona inhibited the phagocytosis of PLGA nanoparticles by Raw 264.7 cells. Studies have shown that the role of the protein corona in biological systems can be divided into \"opsonins\" and \"dysopsonins\" [41] . Opsonins promote macrophage phagocytosis, while dysopsonins inhibit phagocytosis. The structure and composition of the corona depend on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, which includes the chemistry, topography and curvature of the nanomaterial. Polymer nanoparticles possess various chemical compositions, free residues and morphologies (such as spheres, rods, vesicles, tubules and lamellae), which provide them with more diverse synthetic identities. After PLGA nanoparticles enter the blood stream, the surface-adsorbed dysopsonins may be more abundant and more stable.",

Positively charged AA coated particles showed higher affinity to Apolipoprotein A-I (15% in serum and plasma) while HRG was determined at 13% in serum and 14% in plasma. In order to understand how the nanoparticles physico-chemical properties govern the composition of the corona, the adsorbed proteins were sorted by increasing molecular weight (Figures S6 and S7) and increasing isoelectric points (Figures S8 and S9). We observed a distinct enrichment of proteins of small molecular weight (such as Apolipoprotein A-I, HGR and Albumin) on all nanoparticle coronas. In our previous study focused on protein adsorption on planar plasma polymer-coated substrates, one of the top five bound proteins was Apolipoprotein B-100 (MW = 517.0 KDa) [52]. In contrast, in the present study, the largest protein observed in the top five most abundant proteins adsorbed on PPSiNPs was Albumin, which is only 69.4 KDa in molecular weight. Hence, the present results indicate that protein adsorption on nanoparticles isn't a process governed by chemistry alone, but that steric effects due to the particles curvature also influence the corona composition [63]. \n\nIt is often suggested that positively charged proteins are attracted to negatively charged surfaces [64]. A study on model latex particles functionalized with different chemical groups has shown that negatively charged particles bearing acidic functional groups exhibit a general preference for proteins of isoelectric point greater than 5.5; while In order to understand how the nanoparticles physico-chemical properties govern the composition of the corona, the adsorbed proteins were sorted by increasing molecular weight (Figures S6 and S7) and increasing isoelectric points (Figures S8 and S9).",

            "text": "When nanoparticles enter biological media, the number of proteins they may get in contact with is in the thousands. However, they cannot all fit onto the nanoparticle surface: typically, less than 100 proteins form the hard corona in nanoparticles of >10 nm [34,35], resulting in the possibility of subpopulations of a certain nanoparticle with different protein coronas, potentially showing different in vivo behavior [11]. The impact of the environment in the protein corona composition is not limited to the upfront formation of the corona, but when the NPPC changes its location, the composition of the corona is affected by the new environment, leading to changes in the identity and quantity of the proteins that formed the hard corona. Protein composition variation is even more pronounced in the soft corona, as they have lower and more variable resident times. Therefore, characterization and understanding the size and composition of the protein corona is critical to predicting the behavior of the NPPC in biological systems, and to design nanoparticles with specific properties, such as improved biocompatibility or targeted drug delivery. In this regard, the identification of both major and minor proteins that form the corona is essential, as is the study of their abundance and their affinity, e.g., to study their competition to bind when the system is under kinetic or thermodynamic influence, or understanding the NPPC fate in biological systems or role in biomedicine [8,18]. \n\nIt should be stressed that identification of the different proteins is not enough to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. The dynamism in the protein corona composition (particularly the soft corona), as well as the reasonable assumption that the most abundant proteins will define the biological roles of the NPPC, demands quantitative data in order to achieve a comprehensive characterization. Additionally, considering that protein corona composition is driven by the affinity and interactions between nanoparticle and proteins, there is not necessarily a correlation in protein abundance in the media and in the corona [17,18]. Because of these challenges that entail the study of NPPCs in biological systems, unbound proteins present in the media must be removed prior to the proteomic study of the corona, without affecting or altering the NPPC composition.",

            "text": "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

            "text": "For long-distance information transport, exosomes and microvesicles are of interest as vehicles. Exosomes are derived from endosomal compartments named multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whereas microvesicles directly bud from plasma membranes (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2018(Th\u00e9ry et al., , 2002)). During long-distance transport, EVs encounter biological fluids, such as blood, and proteins likely adsorb to their surface. This is referred to as protein corona formation. The adsorbed protein corona can ultimately alter the EV functionality as observed for many nanoparticles. This has been largely neglected in the field of EV research. The formation of an EV protein corona was first described by T\u00f3th et al. who revealed the protein composition as well as demonstrated the influence of a protein corona on EV functionality (T\u00f3th et al., 2021). Shortly after, this was confirmed by Wolf et al. who demonstrated that a protein corona is necessary for EVs to reach their full potential in angiogenesis and wound healing assays (Wolf et al., 2022). These findings started a paradigm shift from viewing plasma-derived proteins as contaminants of EV preparations towards considering them as additional EV components. \n\nPresumably, the insights into the protein corona formed on nanoparticles also will benefit the functional understanding of the EV corona. Nanoparticles quickly adsorb proteins upon contact with biological fluids. This changes their chemical identity to a biological identity and ultimately alters their biodistribution and cell uptake (Walczyk et al., 2010). Distinct proteins regulate the uptake of nanoparticles. Apolipoproteins, a class of lipid-binding proteins abundant in human blood, are known to promote a prolonged blood circulation time by avoiding uptake in phagocytic monocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Gustafson et al., 2015). This has also been referred to as stealth effect. In contrast, so-called opsonins, such as immunoglobulins mark nanoparticles for uptake in phagocytes (Yang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In protein-nanoparticle binding experiments that focus on the soft corona and potentially loosely bound protein molecules, the concentration of nanoparticles needs to be as low as possible to minimize protein depletion in the solution so that the total concentration of protein (C 0 ) can be assumed to be similar to the unbound concentration (C) and a Hill-Langmuir model can be applied. The bound and unbound protein concentrations cannot be measured without the separation of nanoparticles from the solution, which would affect the soft corona; therefore, it is only possible to rely on minimizing the nanoparticle concentration so that C 0 \u2248 C. Figure S2 illustrates this concept by plotting the binding curve of Figure 1a, taking into account protein depletion at different nanoparticle concentrations. This condition is equivalent to minimizing a receptor concentration when studying the binding of a ligand in biochemistry. If the nanoparticle concentration is too low, however, DLS measurements of protein adsorption on nanoparticles may be inaccurate due to excessive contribution from protein molecules in the solution to overall scattering [31]. We mitigated the latter by using relatively large nanoparticles (100 nm), whose scattering is substantially higher than the scattering of ~5 nm proteins (the scattering intensity is proportional to the sixth power of the size). The optimal nanoparticle size and nanoparticle concentrations used in this study were key to producing truly representative binding curves and allowing subsequent analysis. \n\nThe analysis of binding data for the two nanoparticle materials and three protein types reveals that both variables impact the adsorption properties, with the nanomaterial type being the primary source of variance. Blood plasma contains more than 1000 different proteins [10], and over 100 have been reported to form a hard protein corona on silica [4] and gold nanoparticles [32]. Therefore, the scale of the experiments reported here is not sufficient to cover the vast diversity of the blood plasma proteome. Instead, the intent was to validate a method that can highlight certain aspects of protein corona complexity, such as determining the effect size of nanoparticle materials and protein types, and identifying the unique binding properties of individual proteins.",

            "text": "The most important difficulty in obtaining a successful translation of innovative formulations in clinical practice is the lack of knowledge of their in vivo performance at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels (Tang et al., 2017). This large gap between the design of nanosystems and their effective clinical application is primarily due to the partial understanding of the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Once systemically administered, nanoparticles are characterized by a significant modulation of their physicochemical characteristics. For this reason, a full characterization of nanosystems is a mandatory step in the preformulation phases of novel nanomaterials in order to improve the outcomes in the development of nanomedicines (Corbo et al., 2016). Upon exposure to biological fluids N of nanoparticles dynamically and often immediately (<0.5 min) interact with biomolecules such as proteins and lipids through a process defined as opsonization when injected into the blood stream, promoting the formation of the so-called \"biocorona\" on their surfaces (Cai and Chen, 2019;Lima et al., 2020). The adsorption of opsonins causes their recognition as non-self compounds, promoting their metabolism and elimination by the MPS, leading to a rapid clearance, low efficiency, and high liver accumulation. Notably, opsonins rapidly identify the positively-charged particles with respect to anionic systems (Neagu et al., 2017). \n\nSeveral types of serum proteins, such as serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, clustering and apolipoproteins generally present in the biological milieu, can all interact with circulating nanosystems (Lee et al., 2015). It has been reported by several studies that the formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process, induced by the competition of various proteins adsorbed onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and it can be classified as either \"soft\" or \"hard\" as a function of the nature of the compounds and interactions involved. Namely, the hard corona presents the first tightly bound layer of proteins over an extended period (many hours), while the soft corona represents a second layer of protein (not directly bound to the nanosystems) facing rapid exchanges for shorter periods (i.e.",

            "text": "The applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

            "text": "This competitive process of protein adsorbtion, which depends on protein concentration, affinity, and incubation time, is known as the Vroman effect [48]. Although there are certain proteins that are specific to certain nanoparticles and their composition in the protein corona depends on the characteristics of the nanoparticle, albumin, IgG, fibrinogen, and apolipoprotein are the proteins identified in almost all protein corona analyzes [49]. According to Carvedal and colleagues, this phenomenon is due to the high concentration of these proteins in the blood. \n\nThe composition of the protein corona at any time will depend on the concentration and kinetic properties of the plasma proteins, which is why it is important to know the dynamics of corona protein exchange, which will determine the role of the protein corona in the overall biological profile of nanoparticle [48]. Several trials of unexplained nanoparticles have shown that in biological media, solid corona proteins change very slowly, most of them over a period of several hours, while those of soft corona change very rapidly, within a few seconds. This time discrepancy points to the fact that the key factor in the biological behavior of nanoparticles lies in the interface of the solid and soft protein corona. A kinetic analysis of the protein corona of solid nanoparticles showed that the albumin was initially bound to the nanoparticles and then replaced by fibrinogen, after which fibrinogen was replaced by apolipoproteins. High plasma concentrations of apolipoproteinshave been shown to be able to replace fibrinogen within seconds [50]. Another study showed the kinetics of protein adsorbtion of lecithin-coated polystyrene nanoparticles.The results showed qualitative and quantitative changes in the protein corona. Namely, the corona content of C3, IgG and ApoE increased during the test period (360min), while the albumin content remained unchanged [51].",

The protein corona cannot only induce steric stabilization and reduce non-specific cellular uptake but also promote the destabilization effect of GNPs by impacting proteinmediated bridging, changing surface charge compensation and inhomogeneity onto the GNPs (Charbgoo et al., 2018). Notably, this kind of proteins forming the outer layer affect the suborgan biodistribution of AuNPs.

            "text": "In the past few decades, it has been well shown that the protein corona formation on nanoparticles' surfaces influences their in vivo fate and may significantly interfere with the targeting yields, biodistribution, and cell internalization of nano-delivery systems [33,34]. Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands [35]. Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo. For this purpose, samples containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG), nano-carriers covered with POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL), and formulations with no PEG or POL in the content (NL0 and NLC0) were prepared and incubated for 1 h in human plasma from healthy volunteers. The results from the protein adsorption studies are given in Table 2. From the results presented in Table 2, it can be concluded that the formulations prepared with no stealth polymer on their surface tended to have a significantly higher % of plasma protein adsorption (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0290 for NL and NLC, respectively; p < 0.05; ANOVA) compared to the formulations containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG) or POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL). The obtained results were expected, since PEGylation has been a traditionally used method for reducing the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins [21,36]. Similar to PEG, the hydrophilic blocks of POL on the hydrophobic surfaces of lipid nanoparticles are capable of forming a hydrophilic barrier for protein adsorption, resulting in reduced mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) uptake and thus achieving a prolonged blood circulation time [20,[37][38][39].\n\nOn the other hand, it was revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of the adsorbed plasma proteins onto the formulations covered with PEG (p = 0.1448; p < 0.05; t-test) and POL (",

Understanding the interactions that can be established between nanoparticles and biologic systems, as well as the modulation of nanoparticles' surface physicochemical properties will allow us to predict the forces that govern the nano-bio interactions, and consequently the nanomedicines' biological fate and efficacy in cancer therapy. [9,12] In recent years, different strategies have been developed to improve nanoparticles' circulation time, mainly by the optimization of their physicochemical properties and functionalization with hydrophilic polymers or biomimetic coatings. [18][19][20] Particularly, the creation of biomimetic coatings based on cell-derived vesicles is an emerging concept to improve the nanomaterials' biological performance. These cell-derived vesicles inherit the unique features of the source cells, such as biocompatibility, long circulation time, homologous targeting, and immune evasion, showing a high potential to create novel and more effective cancer therapies. [21,22] Therefore, in this review, an overview of the practical approaches described in the literature to prolong nanoparticles' blood circulation is provided. Initially, the nanoparticles' application in cancer therapy and their biological and physicochemical interactions in the bloodstream will be discussed.

Therefore, the chemical strength of the nanomaterials exposed to the disintegrative endosomal environment gaining increasing consideration. In this context, it is further imperative to notice that in addition to acidic pH, lysosomes possess high levels of hydrolytic bio-catalysis that has potential to degrade any nanomaterials completely or to their surface corona, which is required for particle stability. Besides, it has been reported that after endosomal uptake of nanomaterials, conjugated or non-specifically bound proteins degrades rapidly by a low-specific protease Cathepsin L, leading to significant loss of function of bio-conjugated particles. In particular, for nanomaterials that were encompassing intracellular targeting molecules or pharmaceutical active drugs such effects can have noteworthy consequences. Likewise, mostly biologically relevant moieties will be degraded more easily; the nanomaterials can be stripped from their surface corona resulting in different physicochemical properties such as intra-endosomal aggregation [87][88][89].\n\nOn the contrary, proteins bind to the nanoparticles in biological fluids leading to generating surface coating on a nanomaterial known as the protein corona. This protein corona considerably affects the interaction of the nanomaterials with biological systems. In highly dynamic physiological systems it is imperative to understand the formation and development of protein-corona and its biological relevancy prior to employing such materials for biomedical applications. In this viewpoint, by using silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various size and surface functionalization in human plasma, corona formation has been studied. This study has revealed rapid material-specific corona formation of almost 300 different proteins. Furthermore, it has been established that though the composition of specific corona did not differ considerably over the time but the amount of bound protein changed significantly. The properties of the biomolecules derived surface corona can be directly linked to its biological impacts. Therefore, critical assessment and basic knowledge of such nano-bio interfacial interactions became imperative in terms of rates, affinities and stoichiometries of protein association with, and dissociation from respective nanomaterial.

Upon entry into biological environments, different blood proteins would be adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surfaces, depending on the initial physicochemical properties, and form protein coronas, which give them distinct biological identities. Most of these proteins, such as immunoglobins, fibronectin, thrombospondin, and components of the complement system, are opsonins that bind the nanoparticles and recognize the scavenger receptors on the surface of macrophage cells. As a result, the nanoparticles could easily be cleared by macrophage cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). 2 In this regard, most nanoparticles with organic and synthetic surfaces face rapid clearance by organs of the RES after intravenous (IV) injection. In addition, the uncontrollable and unpredictable localization of nanoparticles after IV injection has created a barrier to efficient cancer diagnosis and therapy. Tailoring the physicochemical properties of the engineered nanoparticles has become a major focus of nanomedicine research.\n\nThe protein coronas change the original conformation of the synthetic nanoparticles, and the altered identity plays an important role in biological applications. Recent studies suggest that the composition of the protein coronas and the bio-interactions 4230 gao et al were determined by the original properties of the synthetic nanoparticles. [3][4][5][6] Many physicochemical properties, including size, charge, surface modifications, core compositions, and targeting ligand functionalization can substantially affect the biodistribution of nanoparticles after IV administration. 7 In order to prolong blood residence time, reduce accumulation in RES organs, and eventually increase the targeted efficiency of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, endeavors have been made to search for ideal drug-delivery nanocarriers. Particle size has been considered a key parameter for preparing long-circulating nanoparticles and obtaining improved therapeutic efficacy. It has been reported that the ideal size of nano",

Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

The nanoparticle complexed with SA more strongly interacted with the lipid membrane than the nanoparticle alone did, implying that protein adsorption could enhance the nanoparticle-membrane binding [93]. Our group simulated the adsorption of lipids onto gold nanoparticles coated with phenylalanine (Phe), showing the formation of a lipid corona on the surface of gold nanoparticle via electrostatic interactions between charged lipid headgroups and terminal groups of phenylalanine. At low lipid concentrations, unsaturated lipids could form a complete lipid corona around a single gold-Phe nanoparticle, as observed in the experimental observation of lipid corona formation, while saturated lipids only partially coated all gold-Phe nanoparticles, causing them to aggregate [94]. Bai et al. found that the surface charge of nanoparticles significantly influenced their interactions with zwitterionic and anionic lipids, affecting how the lipid bilayer wrapped around the nanoparticle. In addition, differences in lipid composition between the corona and the bulk lipid structure were driven by the nanoparticle's lipid affinity and the intrinsic properties of the lipids themselves [95]. Li et al. found that the preadsorption of SA onto nanoparticles weakened the interactions between nanoparticles and complemented protein C3b and the nanoparticle-membrane binding (Figure 12). This supported experimental observations that SA corona on the nanoparticle surface could inhibit further protein adsorption, thereby prolonging the circulating lifetime [96].",

            "text": "Thus, the formation of protein corona and its impacts are considered one of the keystones to the gap between in vitro design and in vivo therapeutic effect. \n\nThus, there is a pressing need for the understanding of protein-NPs interactions to control the formation of protein corona. Several articles have suggested that the protein-NPs interactions are associated with the physicochemical properties of the NPs and the media 19,20 . To control the formation of protein corona, the directional modification of the physicochemical properties of the NPs is an effective strategy. The modifications of surface charge, hydrophobicity and morphology of NPs are complicated and costly, which makes the NPs even harder for industrialization 21 . Compared to other properties of NPs, the control of NPs size is the most mature and commonly used methods during NPs designing. Besides, the medium pH of the lesion varies with the disease type and condition. Hence, the medium pH is considered one of the key factors during the protein corona formation of NPs. \n\nA series of articles have been reported to illustrate the effect of particle size or media pH on protein corona formation in gold NPs 22e24 , silica NPs 25,26 and polymeric NPs 27 . It was suggested that the amount and types of adsorption protein were significantly affected by these factors. However, the systemic studies about the interaction between solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and protein are still missing. The conclusions or experiences obtained from the previous studies are not sufficient for comprehensive understanding the protein corona formation of SLNs. Unlike inorganic NPs, SLNs is a lipid-based nanocarrier which bears a core-shell structure: a hydrophilic surfactant shell and a hydrophobic lipid core. In the past decades, SLNs was widely employed in the treatment of colon cancer 28 , cystic fibrosis 29 , bacterial infection 30 , sepsis 31 , etc., and great therapeutic effects were shown in these studies. Compared to metal or polymeric NPs, the clinical transformation of SLNs is also more promising for its simple and low-cost production process, high biocompatibility and excellent drug loading capacity. When the administrated SLNs absorbed into plasma and most human organs, they are exposed to near-neutral pH environment.",

[25] Biological fluids (e.g., blood and interstitial fluid) present a high protein content. Since most nanomedicines are intravenously administered, the absorption of blood proteins is the most discussed in the literature. Blood is a highly complex fluid composed of cellular and acellular elements. The protein Adv.

[39] Upon administration, nanoparticles can be rapidly covered by a high abundance of proteins, which are adsorbed with low affinity, forming a dynamic protein corona (called \"soft corona,\" Figure 1). After a few minutes, the soft corona is replaced by proteins with higher affinity, which are strongly adsorbed to nanoparticles' surfacecalled \"hard corona\". [17,25,40,41] Therefore, the nano-proteins interaction is also denominated as the first nano-bio interface of nanomedicines. [25] The protein corona will induce several changes in the nanomaterial physicochemical properties (e.g., aggregation state, hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and surface chemistry), which can be very distinct from its synthetic identity and compromise its therapeutic performance. Moreover, the adsorbed proteins may induce RES activation and accelerate the nanoparticles' elimination. Additionally, the adsorbed proteins can also participate in the activation of a series of signaling cascades that can lead to coagulation and/or anaphylactic shock. [25,41,42]",

The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties.

            "text": "In summary, this study revealed a previously unknown effect of intracellular exchange of protein corona components on CMA activation as a result of proteostasis disruption. The enhanced CMA activity arising from shedding of blood proteins intracellularly was further identified by determining the cellular metabolism at both cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 6). In brief, as nanoparticles migrated from the bloodstream into cells, the nanoparticles would disassociate part of their acquired blood proteins, which were replaced by cellular proteins due to their higher affinity for the nanoparticles' surface. This intracellular transformation of the protein corona further modulated nanoparticle-induced biological processes, including proteostasis and metabolic stress responses, especially glycolysis and lipid metabolism. This alteration of cell metabolism was caused by the interplay of coronal proteins with other molecules in the cellular environments. PKM2, a key molecule for cellular metabolism, was incorporated into the nanoparticles corona and subsequently dominated their biological identity. \n\nFor NMs used as nanomedicines or nanocarriers, a better understanding of the \"biological identity\" of their intracellular protein corona is crucial to ensure their biological benefits while minimizing their potential hazards. Biologically, proteostasis is central to cell function, and its disruption, as revealed by the current study, entails profound implications for mediating human disorders ranging from cancers to aging. Furthermore, the protein corona-induced CMA can influence cellular clearance of nanoparticles and alter cellular metabolism, which may impact the efficiency and bioavailability of nanoscale delivery systems. CMA could be a useful target for directing and manipulating the cellular and subcellular fate of nanoparticles. Such understanding of the intracellular protein corona, together with our existing knowledge of the physical and biochemical transformations of NMs in tissues and organs (11,57,58), highlights the complexity of the nano-bio interface and provides a crucial new molecular insight for guiding the safe design of future nanomedicines.",

            "text": "Upon interaction with physiological/biological fluids, nanoparticles get covered by biological macromolecules forming a protein corona. The adsorption of proteins onto the surface of nanoparticles is modulated by Columbic and van der Waal's forces, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding 109 . Further, the amount and chemical nature of proteins adsorbed onto nanoparticles is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and the cell type 110 . The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 . The most common proteins involved in corona formation include opsonins (immunoglobulin, complement factor and fibrinogen) which are responsible for macrophage recognition and rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the circulation 111 . Reduced efficacy, denaturation and conformational changes can be introduced in the nanocarriers following protein corona formation 112 . Additionally, increased particle size significantly reduces cellular uptake and cell adhesion. However, reports also suggest that protein corona might be beneficial. Precoating of nanoparticles with human serum albumin prevents rapid clearance by RES and also modulates transient endocytic uptake switching the internalization of nanoparticles from macropinocytosis to CME leading to an altered intracellular trafficking 113 . Adsorption of apolipoproteins onto nanoparticles also improves transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 114 . This was exemplified by transport of loperamide and dalargin across the blood brain barrier encapsulated in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with apolipoproteins. Results indicated significant anti-nociceptive action in comparison to uncoated nanoparticles confirming efficient transport across BBB. Moreover, the presence of preformed corona also contributed towards lowered nanoparticle aggregation and reduced toxicity.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has experienced enormous growth in recent decades, bringing forward the surging use of engineered nanoparticles as advantageous novel materials in numerous fields such as biomedicine, cosmetics, pharmacology, food, or agriculture [1,2]. Its unrestrained used has resulted in the ubiquity of these nanomaterials in the environment [3] and biological systems [4], and thus nanoparticles may potentially be inhaled, ingested, or taken up through the skin into the body [5]. Then, when nanoparticles come in contact with biological fluids, they become covered by a complex layer of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars, forming a sort of \"bio-corona\" [6,7]. Within the biological corona complexes formed in biological systems, the predominant and most studied molecules are proteins, which on their own form the so-called nanoparticle protein corona complex (NPPC) [5,8]. The protein corona defines the biological identity of the nanoparticle, the NPPC being the entity that finally interacts with and is \"seen\" or recognized by the cell [6]. \n\nUpon introduction in a biological fluid, the process of protein adsorption is an almost instantaneous event given the higher binding energy of the nanoparticle surface compared to the surrounding biological environment (Gibbs free energy drives the complex stability) [9,10]. The formation of the corona, driven by non-covalent forces, is dynamic and changes over time because of continuous association and dissociation processes given the different affinity of the proteins. Initially, higher concentration proteins will interact with the nanoparticle, but will eventually be displaced by higher-affinity proteins until reaching an equilibrium, when protein exchanges would not affect the composition of the corona [6,9,11,12]. In fact, although the formation of the corona takes place over the period of an hour, occurring minor changes for around 12 h [13], plasma proteins have been found in the corona already within the first minute of exposure [14]. Interestingly, the composition of the corona at such early stages does not significantly change over time in protein identities, but in quantities [14].",

Comprehensive studies of corona formation are thus essential to analyse the toxicity of nanoparticles with cells and tissues. This new knowledge will also unlock the possibility of designing new classes of nanoparticles with prede\ue103ned coronas to ensure their safety.\n\nHere we investigated how the corona forms and evolves on nanodiamonds.

            "text": "The formation of the biomolecule corona on the surface of nanoparticles upon exposure to biological fluids critically influences nanocarrier performance in drug delivery. It has been shown that in some cases corona proteins can mediate specific nanoparticle interactions with cell receptors. Within this context, in order to identify corona proteins affecting nanoparticle uptake, in this work, correlation analysis is performed between the corona composition of a panel of silica nanoparticles of different sizes and surface functionalities and their uptake in four endothelial cell types derived from different organs. In this way, proteins that correlate with increased or decreased uptake were identified, and their effects were validated by studying the uptake of nanoparticles coated with a single protein corona and competition studies in brain and liver endothelium. The results showed that precoating nanoparticles with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) alone strongly decreased uptake in both liver and brain endothelium. Furthermore, our results suggested the involvement of the transferrin receptor in nanoparticle uptake in liver endothelium and redirection of the nanoparticles to other receptors with higher uptake efficiency when the transferrin receptor was blocked by free transferrin. These data suggested that changes in the cell microenvironment can also affect nanoparticle uptake and may lead to a different interaction site with nanoparticles, affecting their uptake efficiency. Overall, correlating the composition of the protein corona and nanoparticle uptake by cells allows for the identification of corona molecules that can be used to increase as well as to reduce nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

            "text": "The role of lipids in drug delivery systems is a multifaceted and critical aspect that significantly influences the design, functionality and efficacy of therapeutic nanoparticles. 12 Lipids, as essential components of cell membranes, have been harnessed in the development of innovative drug delivery systems, including liposomes, micelles and more recently, exosome-inspired lipid nanovesicles. 18 This deep dive into the role of lipids in drug delivery systems unravels the intricacies of their impact on the physicochemical properties, targeting capabilities and therapeutic outcomes of these nanocarriers. Lipids serve as the building blocks of the lipid bilayer that constitutes the structural foundation of drug delivery vehicles. 7,19 The lipid bilayer imparts stability to these nanocarriers, preventing premature leakage of encapsulated therapeutic agents. 2,20 The choice of lipids profoundly influences the membrane's fluidity, permeability and responsiveness to environmental cues, crucial factors in ensuring effective drug delivery. Additionally, the lipophilic nature of many drugs aligns seamlessly with lipids, enabling their efficient encapsulation within the lipid bilayer or the hydrophobic core of lipid-based nanoparticles. 12 The diversity in lipid composition allows for the tailoring of drug delivery systems to specific applications. For instance, the incorporation of cholesterol enhances the stability and rigidity of liposomes, contributing to prolonged circulation times in the bloodstream. 21 On the other hand, the inclusion of unsaturated lipids introduces flexibility, influencing membrane fluidity and drug release kinetics. Such control over lipid composition empowers researchers to fine-tune drug delivery systems for optimal performance, considering factors like biocompatibility, biodegradability and release profiles. 15,22",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

            "text": "A link between the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterial and the toxicological outcome at the cellular level has already been proposed in literature (Hall, Dobrovolskaia, Patri, & McNeil, 2007;Mayer et al., 2009); but only a limited amount of preclinical in vivo data with effects on the blood system has been published. Different characteristics such as size, particle structure, shape, and surface chemistry have been suggested as drivers of the biological behaviour of nanoparticles (Nel, 2013;Fadeel, 2013;Fadeel & Garcia-Bennett, 2010). Additionally, the analysis of the protein corona is gaining importance to generate a holistic view of the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles that may influence their compatibility. For instance, FDA's CDER has recently published a draft guidance on drug products that contain nanomaterials (as active ingredients, carriers, or inactive ingredients) (US FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER); Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), 2017). This guidance acknowledges the fact that after entry into the systemic circulation, nanomaterials can affect the distribution, exposure-response profile, and the residence time of an active ingredient. These changes may be partly due to the interaction of nanomaterials with plasma proteins (and formation of a protein corona), which may endow nanomaterials with new biological properties. Therefore, the guidance for drug products containing nanomaterials recommends testing of plasma protein binding. \n\nIn order to gain further understanding of blood compatibility of nanomedicines, we tried to identify trends in the physicochemical properties that have an impact on blood toxicity. Information regarding the contribution of specific physicochemical properties of NPs on the reported adversities in vitro and in vivo was retrieved from the screened publications. The most relevant physicochemical properties described in the reviewed articles that have an impact on general blood adversities are shown in Figure 7. Surface-related properties (such as surface chemistry, surface coating, and surface charge) are most commonly reported to have a key role on blood toxicities.",

            "text": "LSNPs. To decipher the underlying mechanisms contributing to the lung-specificity of LSNPs-mediated protein delivery, we performed a comprehensive analysis of various factors influencing the tissue tropism of nanoparticles. These included an examination of nanoparticles surface charge, size, and protein corona formed in vivo. We first compared the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles showing liver (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 6:1) and lung (assembled at \u03b2-CD-PEI to Ada-MOP of 10:1)-targeting effect. As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S13A (SI Appendix), both types of nanoparticles exhibited an average diameter of around 110 nm. However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are widely used in biomedical applications for imaging, diagnosis and as carriers for therapeutic agents [1,2]. In the field of vaccine delivery, nanocarriers present several advantages over traditional vaccines. Specifically, nanocarrier encapsulation increases antigen stability and prevents its degradation. They enhance antigen recognition and can increase cellular uptake. They also prolonged the exposure of the antigen to the immune system by inducing antigen depot formation. Furthermore, nanocarriers can be functionalized to target specific immune cell receptors and lymphoid organs, improving adjuvant and antigen delivery towards a selective immune response [3][4][5][6]. In all cases, the fate of the treatment will be determined by the interactions of the nanomaterial with biological fluid and the subsequent immune cell responses. Influencing factors include nanoparticle size, surface area, surface chemical functionalities, curvature and dispersibility [7,8]. \n\nThe fate of nanoparticles following administration into living systems is governed by the nature of the proteins adsorbing to their surface [9][10][11]. When nanoparticles come in contact with biological fluids, proteins and biomolecules rapidly adsorb on their surface, forming a protein shell [12]. This protein layer, called protein corona, confers a new identity to the nanoparticles modifying their physicochemical properties and, therefore, altering their pharmacological profile [13]. The formation and nature of the protein corona depends on the biological environment (i.e., serum, blood, plasma) as well as the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials. SiO 2 nanoparticles incubated with plasma can adsorb proteins in higher concentration, which may cause a stronger immune response than those incubated with serum since plasma contains a higher concentration of opsonin proteins than serum [14,15]. It is also known that hydrophobic nanoparticles or those containing greater surface charge attract more proteins [16]. Likewise, the subsequent interaction with biological cells depends on surface chemistry. For instance, nanoparticles with positive surface charge have often been associated with an increased cellular uptake when compared to negatively charged nanoparticles [17,18].",

            "text": "In the last years NPs have been widely explored for their use in biomedical applications. In this context, it is important to understand the interactions occurring at the interface between NPs and biological fluids to predict the fate of injected NPs. It is commonly accepted that the interaction of the NPs and biological fluids is a consequence of several factors.NP size, shape, charge, or coating agents are critical [62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69], but the characteristics of the biological fluids are also very important (ionic strength, protein concentration, pH, and temperature) [70]. Once NPs are exposed to biological fluids, they interact with active biomolecules (mostly proteins, but also sugars, nucleic acids, and lipids) and PC is formed around them by the unspecific absorption of proteins on the surface of the NPs. This effect gives the NPs, upon protein corona formation, a different biological identity compared to bare NPs. The physicochemical properties of the bare NPs such as size, surface charge, surface composition, and functionality, change due to the PC formation. Therefore, the characterization of the properties of NPs after their exposure to a biological fluid has become mandatory for two purposes, to understand how these new characteristics affect the behavior of the nano-formulation in vivo and to design strategies to avoid the PC formation. In this context, Zhou et al. disclosed that the dynamic structure of nanoparticle surfaces can affect the protein adsorption kinetics and thus the interaction between nanoparticles/adsorbed proteins and cells [71]. \n\nRecently, the scientific community has been moving from the mere evaluation of the impact of the PC on the physicochemical properties of NPs to the evaluation of the impact on their behavior in physiological systems. Furthermore, a large number of studies have provided much insight into the layer thickness and composition of the PC, and the adsorption kinetics under different experimental setups. Many techniques have been used to measure the absorption of proteins around the NPs such as UV-visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) [72][73][74].",

            "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

What the cells see is thus not the ideal nanoparticle concocted by chemists, meaning the biomolecular corona could have great biological and physiological repercussions, sometimes masking the expected effects of purposely grafted molecules. In this review, we will mainly focus on gold nanoparticles. In the first part, we will discuss the fate of these particles once in a biological medium, especially in terms of size, and the protein composition of the corona. We will highlight the parameters influencing the quantity and the identity of the adsorbed proteins. In a second part, we will resume the main findings about the influence of a biomolecular corona on cellular uptake, toxicity, biodistribution and targeting ability. To be noticed is the need for standardized experiments and very precise reports of the protocols and methods used in the experimental sections to extract informative data. Given the biological consequences of this corona, we suggest that it should be taken into account in theoretical studies dealing with nanomaterials to better represent the biological environment.",

            "text": "Third, regardless of the nature of the amine introduced (primary, secondary, or tertiary), these lipids were able to efficiently encapsulate mRNA. Thio-lipids may rely on more than electrostatic interactions between the positively charged ionizable headgroup and negatively charged mRNA phosphates to form LNPs with high encapsulation efficiency-\u03c0-\u03c0 and sigma hole interactions with mRNA may also be implicated in the encapsulation process (22)(23)(24)(25). The lipids that failed to quantitatively encapsulate mRNA had either steric or solubility constraints. However, not all these lipids could deliver mRNA into cytoplasm. Investigating the cpKa of the most potent lipids and experimental pKa of the LNP formulations revealed no clear correlation between lipid efficacy and ionizability. For example, lipid 20b contained only a secondary amine incorporated into the thiophene backbone structure yet was more potent than its modified counterpart. Moreover, the resulting LNPs had an unusual pH response profile, suggesting a partial positive charge across a broad pH range. We acknowledge that more work is needed to fully understand the structure-activity relationship of these lipids. \n\nOrgan-specific delivery via LNPs and nanomedicines can be achieved via either active targeting [i.e., targeting ligands (21,26,27)] or passive targeting (i.e., specific properties of the nanoparticle such as size or charge). Little is understood about the adjustments required to achieve passive targeting for specific organs; however, strong evidence suggests that the nature of the biomacromolecular corona formed on the nanoparticle surface may direct the delivery to specific organs (28)(29)(30)(31). For example, ionizable but not cationic LNPs can bind to apolipoprotein E and utilize low-density lipoprotein receptor to enter hepatic tissues (32). The LNP ionization seems to be a major determinant in the corona composition, although LNP reorganization upon exposure to serum proteins may also contribute to this phenomenon (31).",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona interaction with membrane and fusion pore formation followed by detachment from the membrane for sufficiently low ligand densities. Nanoparticles are considered rigid spheres and ligands are considered pH independent. The last condition guarantees that the number of bonds and receptors that is at the end of endocytosis is the same as the number that is at the beginning of exocytosis.

            "text": "Medical applications of nanoparticles (NPs) are wide-reaching as evidenced by their rapid development as therapeutic and diagnostic agents (Peer et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2008;Hubbell and Langer, 2013). In particular, significant advances have been made in cancer therapy by pursuing NPs as drug delivery systems (Gu et al., 2007;Pearson et al., 2012;van der Meel et al., 2013), however, many challenges, especially with regard to achieving precise control over nano-bio interactions, still remain to be addressed (Chauhan and Jain, 2013;Pearson et al., 2014). As increasingly more complex NP formulations move toward later stages of clinical development, the need to understand and overcome those challenges is becoming imminent. \n\nOne of the most important challenges affecting NP-based drug delivery is the formation of the \"biomolecule\" or \"protein\" corona (Cedervall et al., 2007). As NPs enter physiological fluids, proteins and other biomolecules such as lipids adsorb to their surfaces with various exchange rates leading to the formation of the biomolecular corona (Figure 1A) (Nel et al., 2009;Monopoli et al., 2012;Saptarshi et al., 2013). As a consequence, the \"synthetic identity\" of the NP is lost and a distinct \"biological identity\" is acquired. This new identity governs how the NP is \"seen\" by cells and subsequently alters the way in which NPs interact with cells. The composition of the biomolecular corona is dynamic and is highly dependent on the initial biological environment, indicating the possibility of exposure memory (Milani et al., 2012). Opsonin adsorption such as immunoglobulin (IgG), complement, and others contribute to the deteriorated in vivo properties of NPs by promoting immune system recognition and rapid clearance from circulation. In contrast, dysopsonins such as albumin can coat NP surfaces and enhance their biological properties by reducing complement activation, increasing blood circulation time, and reducing toxicity (Peng et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Once embedded in a physiological environment, the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) gets covered with a biomolecular corona (BC) that alters their synthetic characteristics and subsequently gives them a peculiar biological identity. Despite recent studies having clarified the role of NP composition, surface chemistry and biological source (e.g., human/animal serum or plasma) in the formation of the BC, little is known about the possible impact of molecular crowding. To fill this gap, we used a cationic liposomal formulation as a model system and studied its biological identity upon incubation with human plasma, at a fixed liposome-to-plasma volume ratio and different concentrations.\n\nWe carried out dynamic light scattering measurements to quantify the size and zeta potential of the investigated systems and gel electrophoresis to evaluate the composition of the corresponding coronas.\n\nOur findings suggest that NP stability may be compromised by molecular crowding, but the corona composition is stable over a wide range of concentrations, which extend over more than two orders of magnitude. As the biological identity of NPs eventually determines their final fate in vivo, we predict that this study could contribute to the development of a safe and effective nanosystem for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents.\n\nDue to their intrinsic structure, biocompatibility, and ease of preparation and functionalization, liposomes are regarded as one of the most promising classes of organic nanoparticles (NPs) for drug and gene delivery applications. 1,2 The amphiphilic nature of their components makes liposomes an ideal platform for the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, including a large variety of drugs, nucleic acids, proteins and imaging agents. 3 This structural versatility of liposomes renders the design of systems destined for speci\ue103c needs practically limitless, 4 such as vectors for gene and siRNA therapy, 5,6 genetic vaccines, 7 immunomodulation, 8 and tumor targeting. 9 To this end, liposomes are usually functionalized with appropriate ligands in order to address speci\ue103cally the delivery of their cargo to the desired target cells.

In spite of the extenuation of proteins' adsorption by the nanoparticles' surfaces and their functionalization schemes with higher molecular weight deliquescent moieties (including but not limited to glycosylation and PEGylation), presently there have been negligible strategies for the complete elimination of the formation of protein coronas, in vivo nanoparticle biomolecular protein corona formation, and their potential applicability in biological medicines. The potential development of biomolecular protein corona can lead to appreciable improvements in the biocompatibility of nanoparticles and can further ameliorate their toxicity, improve their cell targeting capabilities, can appreciably enhance their drug payload carrying capacities, and can significantly improve their disease detection abilities [22]. \n\nSchooneveld and coworkers in their report suggest that hybrid organic and inorganic nanoparticulate carriers composed of polymers and some of the inorganic materials and natural biomolecules can extend a concourse of benefits in nanophotonic paradigms, nanoformulations mediated catalysis, and nanomedicine-related fields. When employed as multifunctional carriers for biomedical approaches, higher biocompatibility has been reported to be achieved, and possibilities of the integration of various (contrast-generating) materials in the same formulation can also further allow their detectability in the multimodal paradigms [23]. Schooneveld et al. in another study state that silica-based formulations are promising carriers for nanoparticle-mediated drug-delivering approaches, gene therapies, and biomolecular imaging techniques.

            "text": "Nanotechnology is a rapidly growing industry with emerging applications across various fields. Although nanostructures have been present in human life for a long time [21], the understanding and development of advanced nanomaterials are relatively new [51]. In particular, there is an increasing interest in comprehending the behavior of nanoparticles (NPs) within biological systems [17]. The unique size, structure, and chemical properties of NPs introduce a wide range of new applications in many areas of research and technology, including therapeutics and diagnostics [65]. When NPs are introduced into a biological environment, they quickly become coated by surrounding biomolecules, such as proteins, unless specifically designed not to do so [14,13,38]. Research has shown that it is not the NP itself, but rather the biomolecules on its surface, that determine its interaction with living organisms. The layer of adsorbed proteins is known as the protein corona and defines the biological identity of the NPs [39,75,45]. \n\nDue to their size, NPs can distribute throughout organisms, reaching various cellular and organic compartments, and, in specific cases, they can even breach biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier [30,74]. In medicine, NPs can serve as therapeutic tools, enhancing previous techniques like drug delivery as they extend overall circulation time and the drug's efficacy [32]. However, this characteristic also raises safety concerns regarding using NPs [46,55]. Therefore, given nanotechnology's immense potential, it is crucial to comprehend whether it poses a possible threat to organisms and the environment. \n\nNumerous experiments have been conducted to understand how blood plasma proteins bind to a nanoparticle. The findings indicate that proteins adhere to the surface of the NP, forming a corona around it, consisting of two different components [43]: a hard corona (HC) comprising tightly bound proteins in direct contact with the surface, and a more dynamic soft corona (SC) that is in constant exchange with the protein solution (Fig. 1). \n\nExperiments show that the HC binds almost irreversibly to the NP, while the SC binds reversibly [39,43].",

            "text": "The development of nanotechnology is opening a new avenue of research on drug-loading nanocarriers. By virtue of their unique physicochemical properties and biocompatibility, a wide variety of nanoparticles (NPs) like liposomes 1 , metaleorganic framework 2,3 , polymeric nanoparticles 4,5 and magnetic nanoparticles 6 have been reported to improve the therapeutic effect 7,8 . Multiple functions were designed and confirmed in these innovative NPs and great experimental outcomes were shown as well. \n\nHowever, only few of the NPs under development have processed into clinical or market up to now 9,10 . It is believed that the complicated in vivo environment may be the one to blame. When administrated in vivo, the NPs are exposed to complicated and diversified biological fluids with different pH, abundant biomolecules and immune cells, which dramatically impacts the biodistribution, metabolism, cellular internalization, and toxicity of administrated NPs 11 . Furthermore, the administration routes of NPs were diversified, and the biological environment the NPs exposed to varied from one disease to another. Hence, the specific physiological conditions must be taken into account when studying the NPs fate. \n\nAmong them, tremendous attentions have been paid to the formation of protein corona, a phenomenon where biomolecules in biological fluids like proteins inevitably bind to the surface of NPs and change the biological identity of the pristine NPs 12,13 . The surface identities of NPs will be more similar to that of proteins after the formation of protein corona. The in vivo fate of NPs with new identities endowed by protein corona may be less predictable 14 . It was reported that the NPs with protein corona may be eliminated by the mononuclear phagocytic system more quickly 15 , while other studies suggested that the protein adsorption may decrease the NPsecell membrane adhesion and reduces the cell uptake 16 . Moreover, the biodistribution, biodegradation, pharmacokinetics and drug release profile were also be proved to be affected by the protein corona 13,17,18 . Thus, the formation of protein corona and its impacts are considered one of the keystones to the gap between in vitro design and in vivo therapeutic effect.",

            "text": "Another factor involved in the biological fate of nanosystems when administered to living systems is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) onto their surface. This corona corresponds to the shell of biomolecules (including proteins, enzymes, lipids, etc.) wrapping nanoparticles upon their entering within biological fluids [58]. As a result, a distinction should be made between the nanoparticle formulation designed by scientists and what is exactly recognized by cells in the bloodstream, i.e., the PC which will dictate the nanoparticle-cell interactions [59]. Depending on the binding strength between biomolecules and the system's surface, PC is generally described as a dynamic multi-layered structure ( Figure 5) [60]. Formation of a \"hard\" corona consisting of high-affinity proteins (i.e., apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and albumin) irreversibly bound with the particle surface is rapidly achieved within minutes upon incubation in a physiological fluid [61]. Weak protein-protein interactions occur between proteins from the hard corona and low-affinity proteins in the second layer, generally designed as the \"soft\" corona. Both layers are in a dynamic process involving continuous adsorption/desorption of proteins on and off the particle with varying kinetics depending on the contact frequency between the protein and nanoparticle as well as particle characteristics, such as surface area, shape, radius of curvature, etc. [62]. Depending on the type of nanomaterial, it has been demonstrated that the corona can have a size ranging between 3 and 15 nm [61]. Therefore, understanding the formation of PC around any nanomaterial is imperative to the applications of SPION as therapeutic or diagnostic nanomedicines as it may have advantages or disadvantages regarding their efficacy. It has been found that the entry route (i.e., inhalation, intravenous injection, oral administration) of nanosystems directly influences the composition of the PC and its evolution overtime in vivo [63,64]. In addition, it has been shown that loss of targeting properties, as well as a decrease of drug release (i.e., release of camptothecin from SPION or paclitaxel from",

On th hand, the formation of the protein corona on the nanoparticle surface changes the n particle physicochemical properties. It changes the size, shape, and even the aggreg state of the nanoparticle, which in turn affects how proteins are oriented and present the biological targets [17]. On the other hand, interactions with nanoparticles may tr protein aggregation or conformational changes, which may impact the protein func and their interaction with other biomolecules, and may even result in an immune resp to eliminate the circulating nanoparticles. In this regard, changes in protein stability enzyme activity have been observed when immobilized on the nanoparticle surface Upon entrance in the biological media, nanoparticles are involved in a myriad ological processes. The formation of the protein corona creates a different structure will drive and influence the behavior and interaction of the nanoparticles with biolo systems. Thus, the protein corona can alter the interactions of the nanoparticle wit cell surface moieties (e.g., antibodies), promoting or inhibiting the uptake of the nan ticle by the cell [18]. For instance, in a case of study with silica nanoparticle, it wa Nanomaterial interactions with proteins can be controlled by different strategies, nanoparticle surface functionalization being the most common one [15]. This is because protein corona formation is a process commonly considered problematic, and thus great effort is being invested by the scientific community on designing and engineering coatings that minimize protein adsorption on nanomaterial surfaces as much as possible [16].",

            "text": "As we discussed previously, when the nanoparticle enters the bloodstream it encounters hydrodynamic forces and a corona of bloodstream proteins forms on its surface; a subset of these proteins form the highly specific complement activation reaction that leads to removal by macrophages. Regarding behavior in the bloodstream and the effect of size and shape (Shah et al., 2011), the most suitable method is not MD, but rather a combination of theoretical calculation (Decuzzi et al., 2005) and a discretized continuum model known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), described and used to model this by Li et al. (2014b), Gupta (2016), and Gao et al. (2020) to model nanoparticle transport in the faulty tumor vasculature (Gao et al.). As we have mentioned, the formation of the protein corona is an extremely complex process that still remains poorly understood. What is clear, however, is that the surface properties of the nanoparticle affect this and the mechanism through which the protective polymer corona increases the bloodstream lifetime is modulation of the interaction with bloodstream proteins. Schafer et al. (2017) and Settanni et al. (2017aSettanni et al. ( ,b, 2018 combined experimental analysis with MD to study the interaction between two protective polymers, PEG and poly-sarcosine, with a set of proteins found in the bloodstream. They found evidence that the interactions are not amino acid specific but rather a general tendency dependent on the charge and polarity of the amino acid and the nature of the interaction between the polymer and water, in addition to the direct polymer-protein interaction. Their methodology, synergistically combined with experimental work, could provide a route to a rational design approach to the development of new polymer materials being developed that may have superior performance as a protective polymer corona. Lee et al. used the coarse grained MARTINI model to directly simulate the effect of PEGylation and PEGylation density on the interaction between the liposome and blood stream proteins; Lee also used MD simulation with atomistic resolution to study the effect of nanoparticle electrostatics in protein corona formation (Lee, 2020a). There are other examples of the use of MD modeling to study the protein corona of nanoparticles (",

            "text": "In recent years, significant efforts have been drawn focusing on designing nanoenabled drug delivery and biocompatible therapeutically active agents. These systems offer many advantages in drug delivery, such as improved efficacy, biosafety, and stability of the drugs. (Hamidi et al., 2008;Mudshinge et al., 2011;Singh and Lillard, 2012;Balcells et al., 2019). However, all these advances are still far to be translated into clinic. Many factors account for this drawback. However, one of the main issues is the interaction of the nanoparticles (NPs) with the biological medium. When NPs enter the blood stream, they immediately adsorb proteins on their surface. (Lynch and Dawson, 2008;Gao and He, 2014). This coating on the NP's surface is known as the protein corona (PC). Depending on the affinity of the protein absorbed, this coating is known as the \"hard\" corona when the affinity is high and the proteins are tightly bound or \"soft\" corona consisting of loosely bound proteins, probably interacting with hard corona proteins. The nature of the PC determines the biological fate of the nanoparticle, such as cellular uptake, circulation time, bioavailability, and even toxicity, and it is crucial to achieve the goal as a drug delivery system. (Ferrari, 2005;Castillo et al., 2013). In this sense, recently, the importance of the PC in the biodistribution (Sarparanta et al., 2012) or targetability of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) (Rosenholm et al., 2010) as well as the biocompatibility (Tang et al., 2012), among other effects has been shown. Hence, a precise understanding of the parameters that govern the PC formation is of critical importance for the design of efficient nanovehicles for drug delivery. (Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015;An and Zhang, 2017). \n\nThe structure of PC is determined by the kinetic and equilibrium binding of protein with a nanoparticle, which depends on the medium composition and on the nanoparticles' properties, such as size, surface charge, surface composition, and functionality.",

In particular, they found that protein adsorption influences the translocation of nanoparticles through a pulmonary lung surfactant (Figure 10) [63]. Ding and Ma's CG simulations showed the adsorption of HSA into the nanoparticle surface, which promotes the binding between charged nanoparticles and membranes, but it also suppresses the insertion of hydrophobic nanoparticles into membranes, indicating that the effect of protein corona depends on the nanoparticle electrostatics and hydrophobicity [64]. \n\nPharmaceutics 2021, 13, 637 9 of 13 particles and membranes, but it also suppresses the insertion of hydrophobic nanoparticles into membranes, indicating that the effect of protein corona depends on the nanoparticle electrostatics and hydrophobicity [64]. Although these CG simulations have captured the effect of protein corona on the nanoparticle-membrane interaction, the results from these are not always easy to interpret at the atomic scale. To overcome this, all-atom simulations of the protein-nanoparticle complex and membrane have been performed. Duan et al. performed all-atom simulations of a BSA-adsorbed graphene interacting with lipid membrane, which showed that the BSA adsorption induces the increased graphene surface and specific electrostatic interactions between charged BSA residues and lipid headgroups, leading to the reduced extent of lipid extraction from membrane and the slower penetration of graphene into membrane [65]. Our group recently performed all-atom simulations of 10 nm-sized PS particles that were complexed with HSA, IgG, and APO proteins interacting with lipid bilayers and calculated their binding free energies, showing that the adsorbed proteins sterically weaken the interactions between nanoparticles and bilayers and, thus, suppress the nanoparticle-bilayer binding, which agrees well with experiments (Figure 11) [66].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently of great interest for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery. Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

            "text": "with a new biomolecular interface for interaction with blood cells and lining endothelium, and for detection by specialised phagocyte cells with subsequent elimination [20,21]. The components of protein corona rather than the nanoparticle per se are typically recognized by receptors on the cell surface. For example, in the case of DNAlipid nanoparticles, vitronectin enriched on particles associates with \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrins on cancer cells [22]. Analogously, for targeting to hepatocytes, interaction with apolipoproteins is required for some siRNA lipoplexes [23,24]. Remarkably, the liver tropism of the first siRNA drug, Onpattro, is based on the ability of lipid nanoparticles to recruit into its PC apolipoprotein E that enables specific hepatocyte targeting [11,25,26]. Recently, the preformed protein corona was harnessed to convert nanoparticles targetable to tumour cells. For that, particles were coated with tumour-specific antibodies and human serum albumin that helps to prevent phagocytosis of the particles [27][28][29].\n\nOn the other hand, protein corona can interfere with targeted delivery by masking the ligand on the nanoparticle surface that specifically interacts with endocytosis triggering receptors [30,31]. The composition and properties of forming protein corona highly depend on one hand on the type and properties of nanoparticles, like composition, size, charge, hydrophobicity etc., [10,[32][33][34][35] and on the other, on environmental factors, like temperature, [36,37] incubation time [17,38] and, especially, on the biofluid type, [39][40][41] origin and disease [42,43]. In general, protein corona on the smaller nanoparticles is thinner and less dense than on the larger ones [44,45]. In addition, cationic nanoparticles are cleared from circulation much faster than neutral or anionic counterparts [46].

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "The immune and the blood systems are the first biological systems interacting with intravenously administered nanomedicines. The nanoparticle surface is immediately covered with a layer of blood components, forming the so-called protein corona (Neagu et al., 2017). Its adsorption kinetics and composition appear to depend on particle surface properties and will contribute to fate of material in the body. Usually, particulate material will be cleared from the circulation by immune cells via active (phagocytosis) or passive (diffusion) transport before ending up in the organs of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES), mostly in the liver and the spleen. The nanoparticle itself, its drug-load and the particle-specific protein corona will all play their part in how the product finally interacts with various immune components. \n\nIn a joint presentation, Dr Patricia Urb\u00e1n (JRC) and Dr Blanka Halamoda (JRC) presented their literature reviews on the most prevalent in vivo effects of nanomaterials on the blood and on the immune system. Thrombosis was the most frequently reported effect among blood incompatibilities, whereas immunoactivation, including both activation of innate and acquired response, was the main reaction of the immune system (Halamoda-Kenzaoui and Bremer-Hoffmann, 2018). The adversities were linked to the main categories of nanomaterials employed in nanomedicine, such as inorganic, lipid based and polymer based NPs (Wicki et al., 2015). Inorganic NPs were the main category responsible for the induction of haematotoxic and immunotoxic effects, in particular thrombosis and inflammation. The most frequent adverse effects of lipid based NPs were the complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) and the activation of the adaptive immune system. The latter accompanied by the production of specific antibodies and accumulation of NPs in liver and spleen, lead to the so-called accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon, particularly noticeable after repetitive administration of PEGylated NPs. The reported adverse effects could often be linked to the physicochemical properties of NPs such as surface coating, surface chemistry and surface charge.",

            "text": "cells, PEG coating reduced the cytotoxicity for NP-PEG-(NH 2 ) 2(2000) while in RAW 264.7 it had no effect.\n\nproteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29]. As shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa chain C region) showed that PEGylation reduced the content of the apolipoprotein and has an enriched amount of albumin in the surface compared with NP-DMSA ( Figure 6). Proteins like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins are considered opsonins that promote clearance of NPs via interaction with macrophage receptors [71]. In contrast, the enrichment in dysopsonins proteins like albumin promote prolonged",

            "text": "With high surface energy, nanoparticles (NPs) incubated in biological fluids are quickly covered by surrounding biomolecules, mainly proteins, to form a new entity called the 'biomolecular corona' [1][2][3]. As the corona bestows NPs with a new biological identity, controlling the formation of the corona could provide a new strategy for nano-therapeutics, as well as for biomarker discovery [4][5][6][7]. Differences in the number of proteins and their relative concentrations between different coronas are undoubtedly linked to the physicochemical properties of NPs and the composition of biological fluids [8]. Considering the latter, it has been reported that the human plasma concentration in the incubation step affects the corona protein compositions of NPs with different surface chemistry, including commonly used nanomaterials silica and polystyrene NPs (3-80% plasma, v/v) [9,10], cationic liposomes (2.5-80% plasma) [11], gold NPs (10-80% plasma) [12] and graphene-based systems (0.1-100% plasma) [13,14]. The discrepancy in the corona protein compositions between different studies using similar NP types and plasma concentrations, however, indicates that other factors control the corona formation. \n\nNP stability refers to the preservation of a particular nanostructure property, including crystallinity, composition, size and shape [15]. In biological media, NP aggregation that forms large and irregularly shaped clusters is one of the most common issues related to NP stability [16]. As NP aggregates are usually irregular with an arbitrary random shape and a disordered structure, the aggregation has a negative impact on both in vitro and in vivo studies. For example, it could lead to misrepresentative and irreproducible results in the cellular uptake, and could influence the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of NPs in an undesirable manner [16][17][18]. \n\nCholesterol is an important component of human plasma that plays a critical role in different biological processes [19].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

The composition of the corona has a strong influence on the surface properties of the nanoparticles. It can affect their cellular interactions, uptake and signaling properties. For this reason, protein coronae are investigated frequently as an important part of particle characterization. Main body of the abstract: The protein corona can be analyzed by different methods, which have their individual advantages and challenges. The separation techniques to isolate corona-bound particles from the surrounding matrices include centrifugation, magnetism and chromatographic methods. Different organic matrices, such as blood, blood serum, plasma or different complex protein mixtures, are used and the approaches vary in parameters such as time, concentration and temperature. Depending on the investigated particle type, the choice of separation method can be crucial for the subsequent results. In addition, it is important to include suitable controls to avoid misinterpretation and false-positive or false-negative results, thus allowing the achievement of a valuable protein corona analysis result. Conclusion: Protein corona studies are an important part of particle characterization in biological matrices. This review gives a comparative overview about separation techniques, experimental parameters and challenges which occur during the investigation of the protein coronae of different particle types.",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the components of the BP-corona complex. The results revealed that the binding of proteins to BP directly depends on the protein size and, additionally, the BPNSs mainly bind with immune relevant proteins. The composition of the protein corona can also be evaluated using Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

            "text": "Protein corona refers to the complex of proteins and other molecules that are involved in the interaction to nanoparticles (NPs) in biological fluids. Molecules are adsorbed on the NP surface on the basis of the chemical characteristics of the NP itself. Usually, a first layer of proteins abundant in the matrix interacts with the NP surface, forming the so called \"soft\" corona. Such a layer may then be substituted by the \"hard\" corona, made of less abundant protein, but with a higher affinity for the NP (see Figure 5) [42]. \n\nProtein corona can be formed both in vitro, incubating the nanoparticles (NPs) with biological samples, or directly in vivo. Hajipour et al. reported that various types of disease can specifically affect the composition profile of protein corona [43]. These findings have been exploited by different Biology 2020, 9, 202 8 of 25 research groups by using liposomes as NPs able to scavenge the blood pool and surface-capture low-molecular-weight and low-abundance plasma proteins that cannot be detected by conventional plasma proteomic analysis. During the last decade, protein corona research has gained popularity, with many attempts made to molecularly characterize corona profiles after the ex vivo incubation of NPs in biofluids (mainly plasma), and more recently, upon allowing their in vivo circulation in rodents [44][45][46][47]. Hadjidemetriou et al. analyzed and characterized the protein corona formed onto polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated doxorubicin-encapsulated liposomes (Caelyx), recovered from the blood of ovarian carcinoma patients [48]. Their study described the protein corona formed on the outer liposome surface and highlighted the potential of such a novel tool in accessing the blood circulation proteome. An interesting work was carried out by Palchetti and coworkers, who studied liposomes uptake and drug formulations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients [49].",

            "text": "This work exhaustively illustrates all the possible interaction models and how to analyze the experimental data obtained to have a better understanding of the measured phenomena. Concerning the interactions between nanoparticles and blood components, an interesting study reports the QCM-D characterization of the interactions between a lipid bilayer and carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles coated with different kinds of protein corona [20]. The study found that the 'soft' protein corona, composed of loosely bounded proteins, induced a permanent alteration in the lipid bilayer structure, while the 'hard' protein corona, composed of strongly bounded proteins, weakly interacted with a lipid bilayer. However, QCM-D is a very versatile technique with which the interactions of nanoparticles have also been studied with other blood components, such as platelets [21] The study of the protein corona is crucial for the development of safe and effective nanoparticles. The QCM-D technique can provide reliable screening of interactions with protein corona-related blood proteins and has been used in several studies to characterize protein corona formation on polymeric nanoparticles. However, the results obtained from QCM-D measurements should be interpreted in the whole context of the specific system under investigation, and other techniques should be used in conjunction with QCM-D to provide a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. \n\nIn the present work, the QCM-D technique is applied to a rough evaluation of the protein corona formation around poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles. The QCM-D sensors were functionalized with three different blood proteins, namely albumin from human serum (HSA), fibrinogen type I from human plasma (HPF), and \u03b3-globulins from human blood (HBG), and the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the functionalization layers was evaluated. Three nanoparticles with different protein affinities were tested, and the system was validated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis experiments. This research provides a valid method to characterize the interactions between tested nanoparticles and three blood proteins commonly abundant in the protein corona.",

            "text": "Regarding the characteristics of the nanoparticle, Ashby et al. (2014) show the impact of modification of the hydrophobicity on IONPs surface [54]. The more hydrophobic the surface was, the more adsorbed hydrophobic protein was obtained, revealing a more dynamic protein corona comprised of proteins with high exchange rates. Hence, the modification of the surface properties, including coatings, strongly defines the composition of the protein corona [152][153][154]. \n\nOne essential factor influencing the behavior of the protein corona is the medium, which affects the exchange of adsorbed and free proteins; it probably exerts a greater influence on the composition of the soft corona, which is also more sensitive to environmental changes. In contrast, the hard corona resists these changes and contains the proteins with slower exchange kinetics and thus, longer residence time on the particle [54]. \n\nDue to the fact that only physiological scenarios have been examined, the knowledge in this area is limited. Even though some studies characterize the types of proteins surrounding the nanoparticle surface [155], the heterogeneity in the analytical methods and the experimental parameters and conditions have led to gaps and conflicting conclusions. Thus, current and future research should take into account guidelines for carrying out and reporting on experimental work, such as those proposed by Chetwynd et al. (2019) and Faria et al. (2018), on bio-nano experiments, as a tool to enhance reproducibility, extend data mining for systematic comparisons and to ease in-silico and meta-analysis [156,157].",

Actually, it has been shown that PEGylated surfaces acquire the ability to reduce clearance by immune cells thanks to the adsorption of specific proteins in their corona. 20 iven the many effects of the protein corona on the interactions of nanoparticles with cells, understanding which corona components and cellular receptors can affect the biological fate of nanoparticles is important for improving the design of nanocarriers. \u221213 This opens up new ways for the improvement of nanocarrier targeting by exploiting interactions mediated by their corona, as for instance, it was demonstrated for approved nanomedicines currently in the clinic. 21 \u221225 Thus, nanoparticles may be tailored to adsorb specific biomolecules in their corona and, in this way, be directed to specific cell receptors. 16,17 \u221228 Similarly, by correlating the composition of the corona formed on different nanoparticles and their cell uptake efficiency, corona proteins that can promote or reduce uptake by cells have been identified. 28,29 For instance, a previous study in which this approach was applied discovered that apolipoproteins (ApoH, ApoA4, and ApoC3) were responsible for regulating nanoparticle uptake in human mesenchymal stem cells. 29 ince different cell types may have different interactions with the protein corona, by comparing the association in multiple target cells new strategies for targeting specific cells may be discovered.",

            "text": "The precise molecular characterization of EV functions has been complicated because additional biological nanoparticles such as lipoproteins or protein aggregates co-purify with EVs from biological fluids [19]. Among biological nanoparticles in blood, the frequency of lipoproteins was estimated to be more than one million-fold higher than that of platelet EVs [20]. \n\nCommonalities and differences exist between biological and synthetic nanoparticles concerning size, physical characteristics and cargo delivery to target cells [20,21]. A key observation during preclinical testing of synthetic nanoparticles was that they acquired a protein corona coating their surface particularly during contact with plasma, frequently resulting in a loss of function [22]. Extensive nanotechnology research revealed that the nanoparticle corona can be divided into an inner layer hard corona of strong physicochemical interactions adjacent to the particle's surface and a so-called soft corona of weaker interactions forming an outer layer [23]. We and others discovered recently, that EVs from different sources can also bear a biologically active protein corona [24,25]. Its composition could be altered depending on the protein milieu in which the EVs are present [25] and by the method of separation [24]. \n\nHere we asked whether HPL-derived EVs or the platelet-derived soluble factors mediate the trophic HPL effects. We observed that protein-rich TFF-EVs or a combination of the protein-depleted TSEC-EVs with add-back of protein-rich TSEC-soluble fractions were efficient in four surrogate readouts for regenerative function. The EV-depleted TFF soluble fractions and the protein-depleted TSEC-EVs were not active in these assays. We found a shift in electrical charge in TSEC-EVs in a protein-depleted environment indicating corona formation and we succeeded to artificially reconstitute the protein-corona. These results may point to the interchangeable nature of the EV-corona. We conclude that not only the starting material, but also the isolation/enrichment method(s) of choice can result in EV preparations with different protein corona and functional activity.",

            "text": "Here, we assessed the effect of nanoparticle size on binding to proteins. We found that the binding of silica particles to albumin, transferrin, and IgG appears to increase as the particle size decreased ( Figure 1A,B,C). However, we found no significant difference in binding to these proteins when the specific surface area of the different silica particles was the same (Figure 2A,B,C). The larger specific surface area of nSP70 relative to that of nSP300 and mSP1000 may have allowed the smaller particles to interact with biomolecules such as proteins. These results indicate that specific surface area plays a role in determining silica nanoparticle-protein interactions. How specific surface area influences nanoparticle binding to plasma proteins is poorly understood [16]. Several studies have shown that biological responses to nanomaterials could depend on specific surface area rather than on the mass of the particle [17]. Therefore, biological responses should be assessed in terms of the nanomaterial specific surface area-protein interaction.\n\nThe surface charge of the nanomaterials affects the composition of the protein corona. We demonstrated that the surface modification of adding an amino group to nSP70 weakens the binding of nSP70 to albumin, transferrin, and IgG, although there were no significant differences between the binding of nSP70 and that of nSP70 Figure 1 Effects of silica particle size on binding to human plasma proteins. Each protein solution was mixed with SP70, nSP100, nSP300, or mSP1000 (25 mg/mL). After centrifugation, each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained by CBB staining, and the protein bands of albumin (A), transferrin (B), IgG (C), and fibrinogen (D) were quantified with the ImageJ software. The protein content of each band was estimated from its optical density compared with the optical density of each standard solution.

            "text": "Gold nanoparticles are surprising materials, in particular for their plasmonic properties which occur when they interact with light [1][2][3][4]. These properties are related to their nanoscale structure, depending on their shape, size, coating agent and assembly [5][6][7][8][9][10]. This implies that through an appropriate synthetic strategy, it is possible to obtain nanoparticles whose plasmonic properties adapt to the fields of application, which include, in biomedical, imaging, drug delivery, hyper-thermal and photothermal therapies [11][12][13]. While much remains to be understood about how nanoparticles interact with individual biological systems, it is generally believed that when nanoparticles come into contact with a biological medium, such as serum, the biomolecules within, mainly simple proteins and lipids, will adsorb on their surface. \n\nSerum proteins to a large extent include albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), fibrinogen and apolipoproteins [14][15][16][17]. The proteins that adsorb on the surface of the metal, based on their affinity with that surface, are divided into two classes: the ''hard'' corona proteins, that is tightly bound proteins, and the ''soft'' corona proteins, that is low-binding proteins. Among the various hypotheses formulated in the literature, the ''hard'' corona proteins interact directly with the metal surface, while the ''soft'' ones interact with the hard corona, and exploit the protein-protein interactions [18,19]. However, the chemical surface of the nanoparticles plays a key role in the formation of the protein corona; a stabilizing nanoparticle coating such as thiolate polyethylene glycol covalently bonded to the gold surface affects the formation of the protein corona. On the other hand, a citrate coating, which uses a negative electrostatic interaction to bind the metal surface, is easily replaceable and allows for spontaneous adsorption of proteins [20][21][22][23][24].",

            "text": "The protein corona is a layer of proteins that spontaneously adsorbs on the surface of nanomaterials when exposed to biological fluids. 90 The composition and dynamic evolution of the protein corona is critically important as it can impact the interactions of NPs with biological systems (e.g., activate the immune system), can cause either positive or adverse biocompatibility outcomes, and can greatly affect NP biodistribution in vivo. 90 The specific proteins that adsorb on the surface of the NPs depend on various factors, including the physicochemical properties of the NPs and the composition of the surrounding biological fluid. 57 Metabolites, lipids, vitamins, nutrition, and other types of small biomolecules present in the biological fluid can interact with proteins in these fluids and influence their behavior, including their adsorption onto NPs. For example, it was shown that addition of glucose and cholesterol to plasma can alter the composition of protein corona on the surface of otherwise identical NPs. 31,69  mall molecules can alter the protein corona of NPs, after interaction with plasma proteins, due to various mechanisms such as i) their competition with proteins for binding to the surface of NPs; ii) altering proteins' binding affinities to NPs; and iii) changing protein conformation. 31,69  or example, previous studies revealed that triglyceride, PtdChos , PE, and PtdIns can interact with lipovitellin 91 , C-reactive protein 92 , protein Z 93 , and myelin basic protein (MBP) 94 , respectively. Each individual small molecule and their combinations interrogates tens to hundreds of additional proteins across a broad dynamic range in an unbiased and untargeted manner. Our results also suggest that endogenous small molecule function may help guide which small molecule(s) can enrich protein biomarkers of a specific disease class. Therefore, any changes in the level of the small molecules in the body can alter the overall composition of the protein corona, leading to variations in the types and number of proteins that bind to NPs and consequently their corresponding interactions with biosystems. 31,32 ",

            "text": "The transformation of a particle's initial, synthetic reactivity to biological activity after interactions with proteins in a biological environment was brought to the forefront by Walkey et al. [61]. Blood plasma contains~3700 different proteins [62,63], which are present at concentrations up to 60-80 g/l [64]. There are ample opportunities for a wide variety of protein-nanoparticle interactions, and the consequences of these interactions are far reaching. First, surface proteins may either increase the nanoparticle solubility or decrease it, thereby altering bioavailability. Second, they may impact cellular or system functions (i.e., immune system) and alter a myriad of cellular signaling cascades [65]. Third, protein-nanoparticle interactions may alter the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticle relative to the reaction profiles reported in cell-free systems [59,60]. The importance of the biological consequences of protein adsorption cannot be overstated, and the interactions of metal oxide NPs with proteins are central in understanding chemical and biological activity at the bio-nano interface. Finally, the biological identity of each nanoparticle is dynamic and evolves as the nanoparticle encounters different proteins in diverse cellular environments en route to its biological targets. Each biological environment that a particle enters and leaves generates a lasting protein \"fingerprint\" reflective of the path of the nanoparticle to its destination. The serum protein fingerprint depends primarily on the size and composition of the particle, and specific fingerprints may exist for each type of NP [61,66]. The route of administration (intravenous, sub-cutaneous, oral,) will also affect the composition of the proteins adsorbed to the particle.\n\nThe biological responses to a nanoparticle following assimilation are largely defined by the dynamic nature of the protein corona around the nanoparticle and the cellular uptake process that identify the protein-NP complex [67,68]. Approximately 95% of nanomaterials that are delivered to the blood are bound by elements of the complement cascade, are rapidly sequestered by reticuloendothelial organs (i.e., spleen and liver), and never reach their intended targets [69][70][71], unless the liver or",

However, only fragments of the vast space of lipidic compositions have been explored thus far, mainly focusing on clinically approved formulations, such as DOXIL and Ambisome, and often lipoplexes. This was accompanied by an inconsistent approach to the isolation of liposome-associated proteins from their mixtures with plasma, often leading to considerable and uncontrolled contamination with other biological entities of a similar size and density as the liposomes and, thus, to contradictory results [28]. \n\nWe initiated this study on plasma protein binding by basic lipid compositions as part of a larger effort to elucidate the trends in how liposome composition determines plasma protein adsorption in a well-controlled and consistent experimental setup. In this paper, we investigated the impact of a negatively charged phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and/or cholesterol on plasma protein absorption by fluid-phase liposomes. We started with isolation of the liposome\u2212protein complexes and analysis of the protein corona composition with LC-MS/MS. We then compared liposome stability in the presence of plasma proteins with respect to cargo release. Finally, we assessed the liposome uptake by cultured and isolated blood cells as the basic functional effects of protein binding.",

An inorganic core, for example, iron oxide, can be used as a contrast agent for bioimaging or as a signal-transducing element for in vivo biosensing, while a polymeric, porous, or vesicle core can act as a storage and release vessel for drug delivery. 3,5 The physicochemical properties of a nanoparticle determine their usefulness in these respects and decide their biological fate. 6,7 hese properties are highly dependent on the shape, size, and type of the material and, therefore, extremely sensitive to aggregation with other particles or macromolecules in the environment. 6,8 t is well established that biomolecules in biofluids adsorb immediately onto the surface of the nanoparticles. 9,10 The dominant molecules adsorbing to and altering the properties of the nanoparticles are proteins, which is why this layer was named the protein corona by Cedervall et al. 11 Our understanding of the importance of the protein corona has evolved dramatically over the last decade. 12 Today, it is understood as the single most crucial factor to determine the fate and, therefore, the efficacy of nanoparticles in medical applications. 11,13 Proteins with high affinity to a nanoparticle form a dense and irreversibly adsorbed \"hard protein corona\". \u221216 The \"hard corona\" is easy to analyze, while only little is known about the amount and identity of proteins in the \"soft corona\" because of the low affinity and weak binding of the involved proteins. 17 ajor contributions have been made to our understanding of how physicochemical parameters of the surface of a nanoparticle influences which proteins are incorporated into the corona and how thick the corona is. 12,18 This has led to the consensus that nanoparticles for biomedical applications require a hydrophilic surface coating that entropically penalizes protein adsorption, with polymer brushes as the leading candidates to fulfill this role. 12 The highly hydrated polymer brush forms a steric barrier.",

            "text": "In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3). Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

            "text": "For instance, nanoparticles with positive surface charge have often been associated with an increased cellular uptake when compared to negatively charged nanoparticles [17,18]. The modulation of nanoparticle surface charge also significantly influences the immune response. It is frequently recognized that positively charged nanoparticles activate the inflammatory response of immune cells, while neutral or negatively charged nanoparticles cause significantly less inflammation [19][20][21]. The protein corona bound to nanoparticles can either enhance or diminish the immune response. For example, Yan et al. demonstrated the contrasting roles of the protein corona formed on poly(methacrylic acid) nano-porous particles and the innate immunity [22]. Their results shown that the presence of the protein corona on the nanoparticles boosts the cellular uptake by macrophages, while the opposite effect was seen for monocytes. It is now well accepted that the nanoparticle materials, size, curvature, charge, and adsorbed surfactants all influence the protein adsorption and subsequent immunological responses. However, a comprehensive understanding of the unique influence of surface chemistry, without the interference of surfactants, on protein corona formation while nanoparticle size, shape and curvature remain identical is still lacking. \n\nHerein, we address these outstanding questions by tailoring in a controlled manner the surface chemical composition of silica nanoparticles and evaluate how the surface modification affects protein corona formation and innate immune cellular responses. We selected silica nanoparticles since these nanomaterials have attracted significant interest in a number of clinical applications [23][24][25]. They are also biocompatible and can be inexpensively and controllably produced in different sizes and shapes [26]. Silica nanoparticle surface functionality can be modified by the well-known silane chemistry that enables various biomolecules and other ligands to bind [27]. However, these wet processes are tedious, require multiple steps and are prone to contamination by silanes and by-product of the reactions [28].",

            "text": "The role of lipids in drug delivery has evolved significantly, with lipid-based nanocarriers like liposomes and lipid nanoparticles becoming integral tools in the pharmaceutical industry [200]. These carriers are specifically designed to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, offering solutions to the persistent challenge of enhancing the solubility and stability of advanced therapeutic agents. \n\nLiposomes, which consist of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, have gained prominence as versatile drug-delivery vehicles [201]. The lipid bilayer mimics the structure of biological membranes, making liposomes inherently biocompatible. This biocompatibility reduces the likelihood of adverse reactions, making liposomes a safe choice for drug encapsulation. Moreover, the lipid composition can be tailored to achieve the desired drug-release profile, further highlighting their versatility. By incorporating hydrophobic drugs into the lipid bilayer, liposomes can increase the solubility of these compounds in aqueous environments. This is a crucial advantage, as many drugs with potent therapeutic properties are inherently hydrophobic, posing challenges for their formulation and administration. Liposomes not only enhance drug solubility but also protect the drug from degradation, extending its shelf life and ensuring that the therapeutic payload remains intact until it reaches its intended target within the body. \n\nLipid nanoparticles represent another powerful lipid-based nanocarrier option. They are typically composed of lipids and are smaller in size compared to liposomes, enhancing drug-loading capacity in some specific circumstances, for example when dealing with highly potent yet hydrophobic drugs [202]. Notably stable, lipid nanoparticles are suitable for prolonged storage and distribution. A key advantage lies in their ability to enable controlled drug release for hydrophobic drugs, achieved by manipulating lipid composition to fine-tune release kinetics. This feature is crucial for maintaining specific drug concentrations in the bloodstream for successful treatment. The modification of lipid surface properties further allows for targeted drug delivery, enhancing precision and efficiency while minimizing off-target effects through functionalization with ligands or antibodies. The transformative impact of lipid-based nanocarriers spans various medical fields.",

            "text": "Robust characterization of nanomaterials and biological fluids together with accurate methodological approaches to study the formation and subsequent analysis of the protein corona are essential steps in achieving a robust literature database towards designing NP-based therapeutics with higher translatability into clinical practice. Our comprehensive overview of the current protein corona literature on various types of NPs reveals the need for conducting studies with more robustness NP characterization, improving experimental repeats, and using methodologies that minimizes protein contamination and nanoparticle aggregation during the protein corona formation and collection processes. The NP corona formation in each class of nanomaterials has utmost importance specially if there is a potential of translation into a product. For example, amongst all class of NPs, lipid based NP are the most commonly utilized NPs in the clinic, yet their soft core structure often presents a hurdle for NP analysis. Hence, more reliable and accurate protein corona information for lipid-based NPs may enable scientists to develop safer and more efficient lipid-based nanoformulations. In particular, detailed information on the protein corona decoration at the surface of lipid-based NPs may improve our understanding of liver accumulation of these NPs [44] and could generally enable better design-based approaches to their bio-distribution, biocompatibility, and payload delivery outcomes in vivo. In another example, compositional variations in lipid-based NPs were shown to significantly change their targeting efficacies to specific organs. [45,46] The complete replacement of a conventional helper lipid with an alternative anionic or cationic lipid was shown to cause a pronounced and consistent shift of lipid NPs biodistribution in vivo from to either the mouse spleen or lung. [47] The proposed mechanism for such a striking shift in NP fate in vivo is that NPs formulated with neutral or anionic helper lipids can be uptaken by epithelial and immune cells to the spleen or lung, respectively. Robust information on the protein corona profiles of these NPs are essential to define the exact mechanism of action for these and other similar NPs. [48]",

The traditional linear regression model performs poorly for the protein corona, as measured by R 2 (less than 0.40). Here, the performance with R 2 over 0.75 in the prediction of the protein corona was achieved by integrating a machine learning model and meta-analysis. NPs without modification and surface modification were identified as the two most important factors determining protein corona formation. According to experimental verification, the functional protein compositions (e.g., immune proteins, complement proteins, and apolipoproteins) in complex coronas were precisely predicted with good R 2 (most over 0.80). Moreover, the method successfully predicted the cellular recognition (e.g., cellular uptake by macrophages and cytokine release) mediated by functional corona proteins. This workflow provides a method to accurately and quantitatively predict the functional composition of the protein corona that determines cellular recognition and nanotoxicity to guide the synthesis and applications of a wide range of NPs by overcoming limitations and uncertainty. machine learning | nanotoxicity | nano-bio interface | cellular recognition | protein corona I n biological applications, nanoparticles (NPs) interact with numerous proteins and form protein coronas immediately upon administration into blood or contact with the extracellular matrix (1)(2)(3).

The most conventional approach for analyzing the protein corona involves protein isolation procedures followed by protein identification using mass spectrometry-based proteomics (2,6).

It is accepted that the corona drives the biological distribution and toxicity of NPs. Here, the corona composition and structure were studied using silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) of different sizes interacting with soluble yeast protein extracts. Adsorption isotherms showed that the amount of adsorbed proteins varied greatly upon NP size with large NPs having more adsorbed proteins per surface unit. The protein corona composition was studied using a large-scale label-free proteomic approach, combined with statistical and regression analyses. Most of the proteins adsorbed on the NPs were the same, regardless of the size of the NPs. To go beyond, the protein physicochemical parameters relevant for the adsorption were studied: electrostatic interactions and disordered regions are the main driving forces for the adsorption on SiNPs but polypeptide sequence length seems to be an important factor as well. This article demonstrates that curvature effects exhibited using model proteins are not determining factors for the corona composition on SiNPs, when dealing with complex biological media.",

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

            "text": "One major problem with the intravenous administration of colloidal particles is their interaction with the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Nanoparticles for medical applications are frequently given via parenteral administration. As with any foreign material, the body mounts a biological response to an administered nanoparticle. This response is the result of a complex interplay of factors, not just the intrinsic characteristics of the nanoparticle. In particular, most materials, upon contact with biological matrices, are immediately coated by proteins, leading to a protein \"corona\" [65]. Protein coronas are complex and variable. Certain components of the nanoparticle corona, called opsonins, may enhance uptake of the coated material by cells of the RES. The presence of opsonins on the particle surface creates a \"molecular signature\" which is recognized by immune cells and determines the route of particle internalization. The route of internalization affects the eventual fate of the nanoparticle in the body (i.e. its rate of clearance from the bloodstream, volume of distribution, organ disposition, and rate and route of clearance from the body). The cells of RES are capable of mopping up particles that they do not recognise as self i.e. particles they recognise as foreign. The negative effect can however, be remedied by linking of polyethylene glycol molecules to the lipid nanoparticles, thus increasing their hydrophilicity and the residence time of these particles in circulation. Alternatively, the lipid nanoparticles could be engineered to evade these RES cells by limiting the particle sizes to about 200 nm or less. It is believed that these cells do not recognise low nanometer-sized particles as foreign. Several other varied and unrelated challenges are encountered in lipid nanoparticle technology. These challenges constitute a serious research question which current strategies are targeted to address.",

(2020) studied a set of polymeric nanomaterials with varying circulation times in mice and used proteomics protocols to probe the protein corona. This in vivo \"fingerprinting\" study showed that the protein corona changed dynamically over time. Hence, coagulation and complement proteins were decreased and immunoglobulins, acute phase reactants, and lipoproteins were increased in abundance over time. The authors found that nanoparticles that circulated longer were apparently able to shed some of the initial surface bound common opsonins, and they speculated that this continuous remodeling of surface bound proteins may be an important step in dictating the in vivo fate of soft nanomaterials in mice. \n\nPEGylation remains a common strategy for the preparation of long-circulating nanoparticles, although, as we have seen, this surface modification does not prevent protein binding altogether. Hacene et al. (2021) developed an ingenious immunoprecipitation method using anti-PEG antibodies cross-linked to magnetic beads to extract different PEGylated particles including polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. Using Balb/c mice, the authors injected PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles intravenously, and blood was collected 15 min after dosing. After separation of red blood cells, the nanoparticles were quantitatively recovered from plasma (thus suggesting that the epitope recognized by the anti-PEG antibody remains available on the surface of the nanoparticles even in the presence of a protein corona). The authors determined the composition of the surface adsorbed proteins and found that apolipoproteins were enriched on the surface of the nanoparticles (Hacene et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Protein Corona Characterization. Silica nanoparticles have been used as a well-characterized model for uptake studies in cells, including studies on protein corona. 7,37,38 Here, we selected spherical silica nanoparticles of two different sizes (100 and 200 nm) and each with three different surface functionalizations (plain, amino modified (\u2212NH 2 ), and carboxylated (\u2212COOH)) in order to obtain different coronas after dispersion in biological fluid. Nevertheless, any other nanomaterials with varying properties would be suitable to form a panel of different coronas for similar correlation analysis, including, for instance, gold, silver or biomaterials such as PLGA or liposomes. 8,27,28,39 The silica nanoparticles are labeled with a chemically cross-linked fluorescent dye, thus excluding the possibility of dye leakage which could confuse cell uptake studies. SDS-PAGE confirmed that no or little free label was present for the 200 and 100 nm nanoparticles, while residual free dye could be easily removed with a washing step, as we performed here for isolation of corona-coated nanoparticles (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Instead of low concentrations of FBS, pooled human plasma was used as a more relevant source of proteins for corona formation when using human cells. In order to resemble better the physiological condition, full (100%) human plasma was used. For similar reasons, human plasma was chosen over human serum because it includes all blood components except the blood cells. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the anticoagulant used for plasma preparation (which was citrate in the present study) is known to affect the final plasma composition, thus also corona formation. 40,41 Similar effects are avoided when using serum, although serum lacks the coagulation factors. Additionally, other factors are known to affect corona formation in vivo, such as the presence of proteins secreted by cells and the presence of shear stress due to blood flow. 10 Thus, ultimately, it would be important to perform similar studies on the in vivo cell uptake of nanoparticles in conjunction with protein corona analysis on nanoparticles recovered following injection in animal models.",

            "text": "For adsorption of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics, the particle surface can be chemically modified to become hydrophobic, and after adsorption, coated with a surfactant (low molecular weight or polymeric) so that the composite particles become water-soluble for incorporation into the hydrophilic gel network [28]. \n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles interact with biological media (blood plasma, intra-and extracellular liquid) by forming a protein corona on their surface [29,30]. This alters the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and should be considered when nanoparticles carrying chemotherapeutics are applied in cancer therapy [31]. The effect of the protein corona depends strongly on the type of plasma proteins (especially the proteins with the highest concentration, such as albumin, globulins-mainly IgG, fibrinogen, apolipoproteins, transferrin, complement factors, etc.) that cover the nanoparticles when they enter the blood after resorption upon systemic administration: enteral (peroral, sublingual, rectal) or parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, etc.). The structure and amount of plasma proteins can vary depending on the patient's comorbidities (as many diseases and conditions can lead to changes in plasma proteomics), family background (genetic factors), lifestyle, geographical factors, etc. It has been proven that people with different diseases and medical conditions (such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, rheumatism, hemophilia A and B, thalassemia, breast cancer, hemodialysis, pregnancy, smoking, etc.) form different \"personalized protein coronas\" [32][33][34]. Consistent with the concept of personalized medicine, the \"personalized protein corona effect\" must be taken into account when chemotherapeutic nanoparticles are applied in human medicine.",

            "text": "The surface chemistry of nanoparticles (NPs) plays a fundamental role on their interaction with biomolecules and their fate in biological matrixes. The engineering of the NP surface is the usual strategy followed to control cellular uptake and trafficking of NPs and to confer the NPs with specific recognition properties [1][2][3] . A key aspect in the interaction of NPs with biological fluids and their biological fate is the formation of the so-called protein corona (PC) 4 . The corona results from the association of proteins to the NPs, forming a coating that shields the NP surface. The PC composition, the size and the degree of coverage of the NP surface have been shown to depend on the surface chemistry of the NPs 5 . PC formation on NPs is basically an universal phenomena for NPs dispersed in biological fluids and it is even observed in NPs with a stealth coating, i.e. modified with molecules like polyethylene glycol or sugars that result in a limited interaction with proteins 6,7 . PC is the ultimate interface with the biological environment and plays a crucial role in cell-NPs interactions. Cell uptake, cytotoxicity and intracellular trafficking have been widely reported to be affected by changes in PC composition or stability [8][9][10][11] . In a recent work, we have shown that the intracellular aggregation of NPs correlates to the antifouling character of the coating 12 . Modulating the PC composition through changes in the chemistry of the NP surface seems to be a promising strategy to guide the in vivo behavior of NPs as the presence of certain proteins on their surface can direct NPs towards specific intracellular pathways 13,14 . \n\nHowever, little is known about the intracellular fate of the protein corona around NPs. Studies in vitro have shown that the PC is a dynamic entity 11,15,16 . The hard corona, the closest layer of proteins to NPs surface, is formed by the proteins that have the highest affinity for the NPs and exchange slowly with the surrounding media. On top of the hard corona, there are proteins weakly associated with the NPs that are easily exchanged; these are named as soft corona.",

Their sizes, structures, and chemical properties allow for the exploration of a vast range of potential applications and novel approaches in basic research. Biomedical applications, such as drug or gene delivery, often require the release of nanoparticles into the bloodstream, which is populated by blood cells and a plethora of small peptides, proteins, sugars, lipids, and complexes of all these molecules. Generally, in biological fluids, a nanoparticle\u2019s surface is covered by different biomolecules, which regulate the interactions of nanoparticles with tissues and, eventually, their fate. The adsorption of molecules onto the nanomaterial is described as \u201ccorona\u201d formation. Every blood particulate component can contribute to the creation of the corona, although small proteins represent the majority of the adsorbed chemical moieties. The precise rules of surface-protein adsorption remain unknown, although the surface charge and topography of the nanoparticle seem to discriminate the different coronas. We will describe examples of adsorption of specific biomolecules onto nanoparticles as one of the methods for natural surface functionalization, and highlight advantages and limitations. Our critical review of these topics may help to design appropriate nanomaterials for specific drug delivery.",

            "text": "Recent years have seen enormous advances in the field of nanotechnology. A huge variety of nanoparticles (NPs), defined as objects with all three spatial dimensions in the range of 1-100 nm, has been developed, with wellcontrolled physicochemical properties including size, shape, charge, chemical composition and solubility. Many of these NPs have already found their way into consumer products. \n\nOwing to their small size, NPs may potentially invade all parts of the human body including tissues, cells and even subcellular compartments. Consequently, they hold great promise as tools for biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery [1] or gene therapy [2]. However, NPs often exhibit properties distinctly different from those of the bulk material. For example, an enhanced surface reactivity may be observed due to their large surface-to-volume ratio [3] and, therefore, NPs may also pose a biological hazard [4,5]. \n\nUpon incorporation into the body, NPs become exposed to biological fluids such as lung epithelial lining fluid or blood plasma, which contain a variety of dissolved molecules, especially proteins. Depending on the properties of its surface, a NP may adsorb proteins and other biomolecules from the fluid to a lesser or greater extent. A protein coating layer, the so-called 'protein corona', forms and can completely enshroud the NP [6][7][8][9][10][11]. Consequently, at least the initial encounter of a NP with a cell is governed by the properties of the protein corona rather than those of the NP surface [12]. NP-protein interactions are typically weaker than chemical bonds and still comparable to the thermal energy at physiological temperatures. Therefore, the protein corona is not static but fluctuates in time due to incessant protein association and dissociation events. Upon biofluid exposure, the NP surface will quickly become coated with those proteins that are prevalent in the fluid and that have high binding rate coefficients. However, these proteins may subsequently be replaced by less prevalent proteins with higher binding affinity. Eventually, equilibrium will be established, so that the relative abundance of proteins in the corona is determined by their binding strength to the NP and their concentrations in the biofluid.",

            "text": "Different situations might occur in different locations of the airways. The airspaces in the upper airways could be particularly enriched in collectins and other innate defense molecules, promoting the capture of spurious particles by macrophages; whereas in the alveolar spaces, which are rich in surfactant, the immuno-modulatory properties of phospholipids could dominate, preventing inflammation but increasing the persistence, both in amplitude and duration, of nanoparticles in the extracellular material. \n\nNevertheless, we could show that proteins can exert significant effects on the biological fate of nanoparticles (Fig. 1). Thus, our results support the protein corona theory. According to this theory, a dynamic layer of protein is formed around nanoparticles that defines their biological identity once in contact with living systems [27]. Until now, this theory has primarily considered the interactions of nanoparticles with components of blood plasma. \n\nThe major constituent of pulmonary surfactant, however, is lipid. In fact, our data demonstrate that surfactant lipids can dramatically modulate protein-mediated effects. Accordingly, surfactant lipids most likely influence the subsequent cellular effects within the alveolar lining fluid, making them an important factor for pulmonary bio-nano interactions. One might speculate that the surface association of surfactant proteins and lipids could result in a rather complex mixed corona around nanoparticles upon first contact with pulmonary surfactant. A detailed characterization of such a ''pulmonary corona'' is still an indispensable topic and will be the subject of future investigations. \n\nApart from the question of whether a specific corona is actually formed or not, the lung surfactant components have a significant influence on AM clearance of nanoparticles: Although the AM uptake of pristine nanoparticles with different surface properties (e.g., hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic) differed, it became essentially the same in the presence of NS (i.e., under the conditions most closely resembling the in vivo situation). One might speculate that the surface association of surfactant proteins and lipids could result in a rather complex mixed corona around nanoparticles upon first contact with pulmonary surfactant.",

            "text": "In contrast, dysopsonins such as albumin can coat NP surfaces and enhance their biological properties by reducing complement activation, increasing blood circulation time, and reducing toxicity (Peng et al., 2013). The binding of lipids and other lipoproteins to NP surfaces can alter the uptake and transport of NPs (Hellstrand et al., 2009). Taking these observations into consideration, the concept of the personalized biomolecular corona has arisen, suggesting that NP coronas should be characterized in a disease specific manner and not merely based on generalizations obtained from the literature (Hajipour et al., 2014). \n\nWhile biomolecule adsorption alters many physicochemical properties of the NP such as size, shape, surface composition, and aggregation state, NPs may also induce conformational changes to the secondary structure of adsorbed proteins altering their biological activities (Monopoli et al., 2012). In many cases, protein adsorption to NPs can induce fibrillation, immunosensitivity, and misfolding, substantially altering properties such as biodistribution and circulation half-life, cellular uptake, intracellular localization, tumor accumulation, and toxicity (Linse et al., 2007;Aggarwal et al., 2009;Karmali and Simberg, 2011). Conversely, cases have demonstrated that biomolecule adsorption serves to protect the body from the toxicity of bare NPs, facilitating receptor-mediated interactions, and improving pharmacokinetic profiles, which demonstrates its potential advantages (Peng et al., 2013). \n\nFundamental forces including electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and chargetransfer drive the association of biomolecules to the surface of NPs (Nel et al., 2009). A recent report by Tenzer et al., found that the biomolecular corona forms almost instantaneously (in less than 30 s) and is comprised of almost 300 different proteins, although it typically consists of a similar set of proteins in various quantities (Tenzer et al., 2013).",

In fact, upon exposure of the nanoparticles to the serum, a dynamic process was elicited in which the different proteins competed for the available surface. 17 Thus, the composition of the protein corona depends not only on the relative abundance of the proteins present in the biological medium, but also on their affinity for a certain surface. In accordance with other publications, 16,59 we have found in our study that the pattern of adsorbed proteins was dictated primarily by the surface functionality, i.e. the physicochemical identity of the surface of the nanoparticle.\n\nThe behavior of the particles after incubation in FBS was also studied by DLS. The auto-correlation functions of the scattering intensity for the dispersion of particles, the serum, and the mixture of dispersion and serum were analyzed to check for the presence of aggregates upon incubation. When no aggregation takes place, the autocorrelation function of the mixture can be described by the sum of each individual autocorrelation functions. 60 The results of these experiments revealed that no large aggregates of particles were formed upon incubation of any of the samples in undiluted FBS. Surprisingly, for the samples without (3a) and with a low amount of zwitterion (4a), no structures larger than the largest particle or serum component were formed after incubation (Fig. S6 \u2020). Although we observed previously the formation of aggregates larger than 1 \u03bcm when the particles were dispersed in saline media (see Fig. 3), the presence of proteins changes the aggregation behavior of the particles. A possible scenario can be described in terms of steric stabilization by the adsorbed protein corona, which prevents the aggregation of the particles. Previous studies have reported this phenomenon for functionalized silica particles. 9,61 Nevertheless, the aggregation of plain silica particles in presence of FBS has been also observed, 62 suggesting again that the specific physicochemical surface properties of the nanoparticles have different influence on their stability and the formation of the protein corona, after exposure to biological media.

            "text": "Urgent efforts are needed to make manufactured nanoparticles less reactive if there is any risk that they enter natural environments. Nano-sized particles offer many advantages in biomedical and technical applications [1][2][3] due to unique physical and optical properties related to their small size and large specific surface area. The commercial use of nanoparticles in, for example detergents, cosmetics, food, and dental products, is therefore rapidly growing, leading to a rapidly increasing release of possibly very potent particles into the environment. This specifically raises concerns about nanoparticle effects in freshwater and marine ecosystems since many products containing nanoparticles will end up there through sewage systems.\n\nIn a biological fluid, nanoparticles are not pristine, but covered with a protein corona, which mediates the biological effects of nanoparticles [4][5][6][7][8]. Previous studies have pointed to a remarkable specificity in the composition of this corona, depending on nanoparticle size and surface chemistry [6][7]. The corona is dynamic in nature, and changes over time as the nanoparticle moves from one fluid/compartment to another; the timedependent evolution of the corona is governed by the relative rate constants, affinities, stoichiometry and concentrations of different proteins [9]. Proteins in the corona may have perturbed structure and aggregation propensity [10][11][12][13], loss or gain of function [14] or produce an increased inflammatory response [15].\n\nA striking observation is the accumulation of apolipoproteins, particularly apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), in the corona around nanoparticles of several different materials [5][6][7][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Apolipoproteins are fundamental components of the fat metabolism in most organisms, including humans. Moreover, ApoA-I is a structural and functional protein in HDL (High Density Lipoproptein particles) and forms complexes with phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. For copolymer particles it is shown that complete HDL bind",

            "text": "Nanotechnology is becoming everyday a more valuable resource in developing strategies of diagnostics and therapeutics; in fact, a new area is arising which is named nanomedicine [1]. From the use of nanoparticles [2] to nanorobots [3] or nanosensors [4], there is no shortage of ways to apply it to nanomedicine's benefit. Nanoparticles are particularly useful as theranostic agents, as a multifunctional platform which combine both therapeutic and diagnostic applications simultaneously [5]. However, nanoparticles must gather a number of characteristics in order to be considered as good theranostic agents, such as suitable size [6] and shape [7] for cell penetration, biocompatibility, surface charge, efficient targeting [8], and fluorescence, among others [9]. Despite of these advantages and promising applications, there are still many problems associated to the entrance of the nanoparticle in a physiological environment, which may be justified with different intrinsic characteristics of the nanoparticles [10]. In general, there are two different nanoparticle identities, such as \"synthetic identity,\" which refers to their intentional physicochemical properties [11], and a \"biological identity,\" which is related to the physicochemical properties shown by the nanoparticle after its application in a physiological environment and interaction with the presented biomolecules [10]. This \"biological identity\" is profoundly related to the formation of the protein corona, as it significantly alters the size, shape, and surface charge of the nanoparticle [12,13]. The protein corona is formed after the entrance of the nanoparticle in a physiological environment, such as the bloodstream and/or peripheral blood, where the presence of thousands of proteins [14] (among other biomolecules) causes their adsorption onto the nanoparticle surface [15], in a corona shape [16]. The formation of this corona is energetically favorable, with a decrease of enthalpy and increase of entropy [15]. It can be divided into two categories: a \"hard\" corona, and a \"soft\" corona.",

            "text": "The significance of protein coronas on the biological fates of nanoparticles has been widely recognized. Therefore, the alterations on biological effects caused by protein coronas need systemic study and interpretation in order to design novel safe and efficient nanomedicines. In the present study, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein coronas on gold nanorods coated with various surface ligands of different chemical composition and charge. The design of surface ligands is the most importance for the functionization of nanoparticles and further the ligand-induced biological identity determines the fate of nanoparticles in human body. We found that the surface chemistry influences the composition of the protein corona more profoundly than surface charge. Since the first and most important challenge for administrated nanomedicines is navigating the interaction with macrophages, we further investigated how the surface chemistry-induced specific biomolecular corona affects the phagocytosis and immune responses of macrophages exposed to the corona-nanoparticle complexes. Our results reveal that the protein corona alters the internalization pathways of nanorods by macrophages via the interactions of the predominant coronal proteins with specific receptors on the cell membrane. The cytokine secretion profile of macrophages is also highly dependent on the adsorption pattern of the protein corona. The more abundant proteins involved in immune responses, such as acute phase, complement, and tissue leakage proteins, present in the acquired nanoparticle corona, the more macrophage IL-1\u03b2 released is stimulated. The ligand-protein corona composition-immune response coefficient analysis may serve next-generation nanomedicines with high-efficiency and good-safety for better clinical translation.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle protein corona is the self-assembly of absorbed proteins on the particle surface. \n\nThe nanoparticle surface and size determine the amount, identity, polarity, and arrangement of the protein corona, while also influencing downstream effects of distribution, metabolism, and excretion [29,30,34]. Depending on the biomedical application, the formation of a protein corona could either be efficacious or produce an ineffective biological response [35,36]. Previous studies show that the protein corona can act as a cloaking shield during targeted drug delivery; a pre-coating of proteins may reduce the particle-protein interactions in vitro. In contrast, the development of the protein corona on the surface of the nanomedicine may render the therapeutic agent detrimental by routing the medicine to undesired targets [37]. \n\nScenario 2 represents interactions between nanoparticles and lung interstitial fluid after inoculation and incubation; the available information from the published literature indicates that nanoparticle surfaces can be exploited to promote lipid raft transport across membranes [38,39]. Interactions with lipids induce changes in surface properties as nanoparticles pass through cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, or nuclear membranes. Kang et al. (2008a and2008b) showed that positively charged AgNPs facilitate stable transport across olefin/paraffin separation membranes [40,41]. However, once internalized by the cell, the metal-based nanoparticles are likely to be shuttled into lysosomes, where ions dissociate and induce cellular toxicity. Recent efforts have been aimed at preparing nanoparticle surface coatings to shuttle active pharmaceutical ingredients into the cytoplasmic membrane and avoid cellular internalization. Identifying the surface charge and coating that partially interacts with lipid membranes while avoiding intracellular acidification aids in reducing adverse effects of nano-enabled drug carriers [42]. \n\nScenario 3 represents ingestion and digestion of orally administered nanoparticles. Most studies focus on AgNPs used in food products [43]. Cueva et al. (2019) showed that nanoparticles in simulated digestion fluid are structurally different post-digestion but do not alter the microbiota viability [44].",

            "text": "The medicinal use of nanoparticles has expanded in the last few decades, including diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic applications. This growth is driven by the increasing control of the chemical and physical properties of nanoparticles (NPs). In parallel, a mechanistic understanding of cellular and organismal response to NPs has developed. At the molecular level, NPs entering a biological system adsorb a population of biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, sugars, or DNA. This biomolecular coating is dominated by an abundance of proteins, forming a protein corona (PC) (Lynch et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2018;Griffith et al., 2020;Lima et al., 2020). The PC significantly alters NP physicochemical properties, including surface charge and agglomeration state, as well as biological fate, biodistribution, and toxicity (Walczyk et al., 2010;Fleischer and Payne, 2014;Caracciolo et al., 2017;Shannahan, 2017;Nierenberg et al., 2018;Lima et al., 2020). Although often cited as a barrier to development of nanomedicines, the PC can also be used to increase sensitivity and therapeutic efficacy of NPs (Caracciolo et al., 2017;Corbo et al., 2017;Garc\u00eda Vence et al., 2020). \n\nFormation of the PC is mediated by the properties of the NP, as well as the properties of the solution and population of biomolecules within the solution. Biochemical features of the latter may vary across populations and individuals, depending upon physiological conditions and disease states. There is also significant evidence of spatiotemporal changes to the composition of the corona as biomolecules undergo dynamic association and dissociation with the NP surface and with each other over time and as the NP is transported through a biological organism (Cai et al., 2022;Cox et al., 2018;Dell'Orco et al., 2010;Weiss et al., 2019).",

The rapid expansion of nanoparticle applications is due to their large surface area to volume ratio and electronic and optical properties. [1][2][3][4][5][6] However, the effect of nanoparticles on human health remains poorly understood, and recent reports on nanoparticle toxicity have raised safety concerns.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that the formation of a corona on the nanoparticle surface is the most important parameter that controls nanoparticle toxicity. [7][8][9][10] The corona arises from the accumulation of adsorbed biomolecules from blood, saliva, synovial \ue104uid or other \ue104uids in the surroundings. Prior studies of corona formation have indicated an association between corona development and the physicochemical parameters of the nanoparticles, such as size, 10 shape, [11][12][13] surface charge, 8 chemical composition 14 and mechanical properties. 12,[15][16][17] However, physicochemical properties alone cannot predict corona formation, as the composition of the corona changes dynamicallyremodelswhen nanoparticles pass through different tissues. The remodelling of the corona is indirectly related to the intrinsic physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, and it depends on the exposure time and type of biomolecules present.\n\nCorona remodelling is attributed to the association and dissociation of proteins, as described by Vroman's model. 18 Vroman's model, which has been veri\ue103ed in vitro [19][20][21][22] and in vivo, 23 postulates that more abundant proteins with low affinity, such as albumin, bind to the surface of nanoparticles during the early stages of adsorption to form a \"so\ue09d\" corona. During the later stages, the proteins that were initially adsorbed are replaced by less abundant proteins with greater affinity, such as apolipoproteins, \ue103brinogen and immunoglobulins, 23 forming a \"hard\" corona. 24 Notably, the type of serum protein and whether it was denatured",

            "text": "It has also been described that zwitterionic nanoparticles lack a protein corona [29]. Nevertheless, corona formation cannot be completely prevented even with the presence of PEG that reduces protein adsorption without lack of cellular uptake [30]. \n\nThe determination of the corona and the comprehension of its dependence on the nanoparticle properties has become of capital importance in nanoscience as can be stated by the large amount of published papers in the last few years. In this aspect, Lundqvist et al. [31] have reported that even for a specific material type, the size of the particle, and its surface modification can completely alter the protein corona and probably their biological impact. Corona proteins can physically mask the nanoparticle surface, potentially affecting the therapeutic effect of the molecules bound to the nanoparticle surface [32]. On another hand, it has also been described that cellular uptake is strongly related to the nature of the proteins that constitute protein corona [33]. For instance, it has been found that albumin pre-loading increased the macrophage uptake of PPEylated(polyphosphoester) nanocarriers while it was decreased when these same nanocarriers where loaded with clusterin. Sch\u00f6ttler et al. [34] have found that, in presence of proteins, PEGylated nanocarriers incubated with 10% of fetal bovine serum were not taken up by HeLa cells in contrast with the high uptake observed in absence of a previous incubation. Not only altered plasma protein composition due to different diseases affects the protein corona but also, the composition of the corona varies among healthy individuals [35]. Thus, the protein source is a crucial factor in the formation of the corona. \n\nThe protein corona-nanoparticle conjunction has raised the interest of many groups regarding not only liposomes but other organic (nanorods, carbon nanotubes) or inorganic particles (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanobones) [36][37][38][39].",

            "text": "Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) with unique physical and chemical properties have been widely used in catalysis (Liu and Dai, 2016;Sharma et al., 2015), electronics (Liu et al., 2017;Wu, 2017), and biomedicine (Ramos et al., 2017;Ke et al., 2018). Until now, more than 3 000 nanomaterial-based consumer products are on the market (Wei and Yan, 2016). These applications will increase the risk of human exposure to engineered NPs. To understand possible health issues of engineered NPs, it is necessary to clarify the basic interactions between NPs and physiological systems, blood, and biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009;Srivastava et al., 2015). Such understandings will significantly facilitate design of nanomedicine with well-defined pharmacokinetics and biodistribution (Walkey et al., 2012;Su et al., 2018). Therefore, understanding and tailoring the fundamental interactions between NPs and physiological systems has become a focus of nanotoxicity and nanomedicine research. \n\nPhysiological environments, such as blood, interstitial fluid, and cellular cytoplasm, contain complex protein mixtures. When engineered NPs enter such physiological environment, they spontaneously adsorb proteins to form protein corona (Cedervall et al., 2007a,b;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Ke et al., 2017). Protein corona may consist of tens or hundreds of proteins. They alter the physicochemical properties of NPs, such as size, zeta potential, morphology, and aggregation state (Gebauer et al., 2012;Su et al., 2012;Glancy et al., 2019;Marichal et al., 2019). At the same time, the protein corona also alters the interactions between NPs and biological systems and modulates the kinetics, transport, and reactivity of NPs (Monopoli et al., 2011;Lesniak et al., 2012;Walkey et al., 2012Walkey et al., , 2014;;Tenzer et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) have unique capabilities to interact with cells and organs which mark them as attractive working material in nanobioscience and nanomedicine. In order to make full use of their potential it is essential to understand what controls at the molecular level recognition by cells, cell entering and intracellular processing. Physicochemical properties of NPs such as material composition, size, shape, charge, and surface chemistry, have been reported to play significant roles [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. A small size, neutral or negative zeta potential, and extended PEGylation of the surface material are correlated with increased circulation time in blood after intravenous (i.v.) injection [4,6]. One important implication is that NP upon contact with biological matrices such as the blood, are immediately coated by a layer of proteins, resulting in a so called \"protein corona\" [8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. The protein corona modifies and shields the surface of the xenobiotic particles and may subsequently influence or even determine their biological properties, and with this may influence their behavior in the microenvironment, i.e., their interaction with cells and tissues. Previous experimental studies have provided much insight in the layer thickness, composition of the protein corona, and the adsorption kinetics under different experimental setups. Various techniques such as ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), SPR (surface plasmon resonance), DCS (differential centrifugal sedimentation), QCM (quartz crystal microbalance), and FCS (fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) have been used to monitor the affinities of proteins for nanoparticles [15][16][17][18][19][20]. From FCS adsorption curves, Milani et al. showed the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation followed by a secondary, weakly bound layer [21].",

            "text": "Although nanoparticles can be useful for biomedical applications, they have a reverse side, i.e. their toxicity, which needs to be addressed judiciously to optimize their use against COVID-19 treatment [58,59]. One of the major challenges is to ensure the safe use of nanomaterials, since most of the studies have only evaluated the biocompatibility using in vitro approaches. The fate and behaviour of nanomaterials in the body can also change when they reach blood circulation due to the formation of protein corona [60]. Thus, reliable in vivo models are needed to better understand the toxico-kinetic behaviour of the nanoparticles in the body, especially for longterm exposure [61]. During the course of inhalation, nanoparticles can penetrate into the mucosal membrane lining of the respiratory tract. The particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm can easily enter into the respiratory system [62]. The inhaled nanoparticles entering into alveoli may get accumulated and cause inflammation in the lungs as reviewed by Campos et al. [59]. Another issue is the lack of standardized protocols for physicochemical and biological characterization of nanomaterials, as well as lack of a universally agreed upon definition of a nanomaterial [63]. Capacity for large-scale manufacturing is another hurdle that needs to be overcome for broader commercialization of nano-based formulations [63]. Due to the multifaceted interactions between nanomaterials and biological systems (in vivo), it is very challenging to foresee the behaviour of these materials under physiological conditions. Once within the body, the nanoparticles reach the blood circulation, which is a very complex matrix containing ions, small molecules, proteins and cells [64]. It is already known that nanoparticles are able to interact with biomolecules, mainly proteins, resulting in the formation of protein corona [65]. The composition of protein corona is mainly driven by the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. In other words, it is unique for each nanoparticulate system and influenced by several factors. Both protein-nanoparticle interaction and protein-protein interaction regulate the adsorption of protein on the surfaces of nanoparticles [65]. The formation",

            "text": "Proteins constitute the majority of bonded biomolecules on the outer layer of nanoparticles in a serum-containing medium, but recently, traces of lipids have also been discovered [84]. Both protein-nanoparticle adsorption affinities and protein-protein interactions influence the binding of proteins on the outer layer of nanoparticles. Proteins with a hard corona are composed of firmly attached proteins that are difficult to detach, whereas proteins with a soft corona are composed of lightly adsorbed proteins. Moreover, soft and hard coronas can be distinguished based on their interchange times. Hard coronas exhibit substantially longer exchange durations, ranging from several hours to many days [26]. According to one theory, proteins in the hard corona completely connect with the surface of the nanomaterial, whereas protein-protein interactions occur at the interface between Blood flow is another important physical element that must be considered. Blood moves at a constant rate, ranging from 0.085 cm.s \u22121 in capillaries to 10 cm.s \u22121 in arteries, and a maximum of 60 cm.s \u22121 inside the aorta. Protein binding generally strengthens with increasing blood flow. However, the exact underlying cause is unknown, and it is speculated that the enhanced protein-blood interactions result from increased interactions between biological molecules and the nanostructures. Additionally, rapid flow rates induce shear stress on the outer layer of nanostructures, preventing the easy deposition of proteins and making it easier for them to connect with others that possess stronger affinity. For example, this might lead to the enrichment of proteins on the nanoparticles, such as plasminogen and other proteins. Similarly, blood flow could alter the conformational shape of unbound proteins, such as plasminogen or the von Willebrand factor (a protein that alleviates the dormant factor VIII blood-clotting protein). \n\nDiverse conformations can lead to variable interactions with nanosystems, and consequently, different protein corona compositions [82]. Furthermore, illnesses can alter the protein corona of a nanosystem. Researchers have investigated the effect of protein shortages on the remodeling of the protein corona on PS nanoparticles due to common illnesses and medical situations [83].",

            "text": "Understanding the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological systems is becoming increasingly relevant in many biomedical research areas such as targeted drug delivery, 1 vaccine development, 2\u22124 etc. However, it is well acknowledged that these interactions are exceedingly complicated to investigate, mostly caused by the heterogeneous nature of biological systems, such as the existence of numerous cell types with varying characteristics and multitudes of key environmental factors. 5 For targeted drug delivery, for example, a drug-loaded NP injected into a blood vessel will circulate through the body until it reaches the target organs or cells. However, as they travel through the bloodstream, they come into contact and interact with the immune system, which consists of diverse immune cells with varying phenotypes. 6\u22128 The interactions between the NPs and these immune cells begin with endocytosis, followed by intracellular trafficking and exocytosis, which are thought to be highly dependent on the types of immune cells as well as the physicochemical properties of the NPs and may result in significant variations in cytotoxicity. 6,7,9 However, this is an ideal scenario for targeted drug delivery, and many other environmental factors exist in real-world clinical situations. Proteins in biological fluids, for example, can adsorb on the surface of NPs, forming a \"protein corona\", and influence the NP's subsequent interactions with biological cells. 9\u221211 For instance, during the preparation of nano-drugs, fetal bovine serum (FBS) (or bovine serum albumin [BSA]) has been often used to stabilize dispersions of NPs, 12,13 and these FBS-derived protein coronas are thought to modulate the surface functionality and agglomeration behaviors of NPs and affect the cellular association process and cytotoxicity of NPs. 10 Previous studies on these FBS-derived protein coronas have identified albumin, opsonin [e.g., immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antibodies], complement proteins, and apolipoproteins as the major components of the protein corona, 14\u221222 and a subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) study confirmed albumin as the most dominant protein adsorbed on the surface of Au NP",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

            "text": "At present, various US-FDA approved nano-formulations based on liposomes, inorganic nanoparticles, protein-drug nanocomposites, polymeric nanoparticles and micelles are used for theranostic applications (Bobo et al., 2016). Biocompatibility of these nanoparticles has been extensively studied and their toxicity profile has been well characterized. Metallic nanoparticles, for example, accumulate in organs, creating a homeostatic imbalance and lead to DNA damage, oxidative stress and inflammation (Sengul and Asmatulu, 2020). Liposomes are unilamellar vesicles similar to exosomes, which are often known to leak their encapsulated contents on interacting with blood components. Aggregation of liposomes in vivo, toxicity and immunogenicity because of their composition and charge further restricts their applications in the development of personalized medicine (Maja et al., 2020). Moreover, cell specific action of the current nanocarriers is an unresolved conundrum in developing strategies for precision medicine (Sharma et al., 2012). Furthermore, it has been reported that nanoparticles interact with various biological components in vivo, which are absorbed onto the nanoparticle-biological medium interface, commonly known as the protein corona. Formation of the protein corona layer changes nanoparticle surface characteristics drastically resulting in a major deviation in therapeutic efficacy (Rezaei et al., 2019). In comparison, exosomes can inherently circumvent some of these limitations. The exosome bilayer is a complex mixture of lipids, decorated with numerous distinct proteins, such as tetraspanins and integrins. As discussed previously, the exosomal bilayer has a composition similar to that of a cell membrane and this unique surface composition immensely affects its biodistribution. The in vivo formation of protein corona is also reported on the exosomal surface (Palviainen et al., 2020;Varga et al., 2020). Hence, making the right selection of an isolation source and the route of administration is crucial for preventing immunogenicity and rapid clearance.",

            "text": "n this work, using mass spectrometry data from our small molecule protein corona study, 16 we investigate the underlying causes of the increased number of quantified plasma proteins through an actual causality approach. Specifically, we aim to identify which spiked small molecules contributed to the observed increase and to what extent. Our findings could pave the way for a new dimension in protein corona research, where the causal relationships behind compositional changes can be clearly defined. This causality-based approach could empower the nanomedicine community to better anticipate how shifts in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles affect the protein corona composition. For instance, this strategy offers a high-throughput potential for predicting the biological identity of various nanoparticle formulations intended for safe and effective genomic medicine delivery systems. \u221222 By understanding the actual causality linked to the essential components of nanoparticles, such as their composition, physicochemical properties, and surface coatings, we can better predict the biological fate and pharmacokinetics of nanomedicines.

Adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins is an inevitable process that takes place instantaneously upon contact with physiological fluid (e.g. blood). Therefore, strategies are needed to control this process in order to improve the properties of the nanoparticles and to allow targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that the design of the protein corona by a pre-formed protein corona with tailored properties enables targeted cellular interactions. Nanoparticles were pre-coated with immunoglobulin depleted plasma to create and design a protein corona that reduces cellular uptake by immune cells. It was proven that a pre-formed protein corona remains stable even after nanoparticles were re-introduced to plasma. This opens up the great potential to exploit protein corona formation, which will significantly influence the development of novel nanomaterials.",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of the protein corona and its evolution with time have been shown to affect the behavior of nanoparticles in biological environments to a large extent [1,11,28,162]. Our current understanding suggests that initially a \"soft\" protein corona, with a highly dynamic exchange of proteins, is formed around NPs. Changing its composition over time, the \"soft\" corona slowly evolves to a \"hard\" corona with less dynamic exchange [112,162,163]. Previous studies investigating nanomaterial exposure to complex biological environments [3,8,41,112,162] have largely failed to allow for the highly dynamic situation of physiological systems. Coronacarrying NPs may need to instantly react to external stimuli under such conditions as exemplified by considering the blood system where processes controlling haemostasis and thrombosis may be triggered on a timescale of minutes [28]. \n\nTenzer and co-workers [10] recently developed a new experimental approach allowing for a time-resolved determination of NP-specific fingerprints. This method, based on label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), allows for an insight into the time-evolution of the full serum protein corona. Such information, especially for short exposure times, is urgently needed to understand the interactions between NPs and biological systems. Briefly, they used their LC-MS based method to measure time-resolved corona compositions on silica and polystyrene NPs in human serum. By using NPs of various sizes (diameters of about 35, 120, 140 nm), and surface functionalities (amine, carboxylate, unmodified), they were able to provide insights into the consequences of these factors for corona composition and dynamics. \n\nThey demonstrated in their study that coronas were formed very rapidly, and showed an unexpected complexity regarding composition and dynamics on all of the NPs under investigation. They quantitatively detected 166 different plasma proteins within the corona after 0.5 min. The number of individual proteins quantified in the corona increased to almost 300 on the different types of NPs at prolonged exposure times (up to 480 min).",

The composition of soft corona (SC) proteins and their biological relevance have remained elusive due to the lack of analytical separation methods. Here, we identify a set of specific corona proteins with weak interactions at silica and polystyrene nanoparticles by using an in situ click-chemistry reaction. We show that these SC proteins are present also in the HC, but are specifically enriched after the capture, suggesting that the main distinction between HC and SC is the differential binding strength of the same proteins. Interestingly, the weakly interacting proteins are revealed as modulators of nanoparticle-cell association mainly through their dynamic nature. We therefore highlight that weak interactions of proteins at nanoparticles should be considered when evaluating nano-bio interfaces. Understanding the biological identity of nanoparticles has mainly focused on the hard protein corona with the soft corona largely overlooked. Here, using click-chemistry, the authors report on a capture system for the identification of the soft corona proteins and investigate the effects on cell interactions.",

The protein corona, a dynamic multilayer of proteins that accumulate on the surface of  nanoscale biomaterials, forms through strong (hard) and weak (soft corona) interactions. At the cellular level, the protein corona composition can regulate the mechanisms and efficiency of cell uptake and intracellular processing. \u221229 Depending on its nature, the surfactant can facilitate interactions with specific proteins via electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions, directly impacting the protein corona composition. In addition to particle surface chemistry, 30\u221232 the particle mechanical properties have been suggested to impact the composition of protein corona 33 with stiffer nanocarriers adsorbing more opsonins. 34 he examples discussed above point out the intricate influence of particle mechanical and physicochemical surface properties on their cell uptake and in vivo clearance patterns. While it is known that the surfactant of choice might trigger or avoid certain clearance pathways, 32 it is yet to be explored how it can affect particle ultrastructure and the physicochemical properties derived from it. In this study, we demonstrate the multifaceted impact of the surfactant type on the structural, mechanical, and surface properties of PFCE-loaded PLGA nanoparticles. A slight modification of the formulation in terms of surfactant type led to different distribution profiles of the PFCE phase through the polymer matrix with direct implications on the nanoparticle internal structure. While the nonionic surfactant PVA facilitated the formation of multicore particles with the PFCE phase distributed as multiple small domains through the nanoparticle (multicore particles, MCPs), the anionic surfactant NaCh packed the PFCE phase as a single domain within the core of the nanoparticles (core\u2212shell particles, CSPs). This difference in the nanoparticle ultrastructure further impacted the hydration profile of the MCPs and CSPs, giving rise to significantly different nanomechanical properties, as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy measurements.",

This modulation affects the physiological interactions of the nanoparticles in vivo, influencing pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and targeting Several techniques have been utilized to bypass the BBB, including invasive methods such as injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intracerebroventricular injection. However, neurosurgery poses high risks and has limited efficacy [27]. Nanoparticles, including lipid-based ones, can effectively enter the brain through the disruption of tight junctions and transcytosis, which is mediated by low-density lipoproteins, insulin, and transferrin receptors [28,29]. Lipid-based nanoparticles, upon entering the brain, interact with the microglial cell membrane through endocytosis. This process involves phagocytosis for larger particles and pinocytosis for smaller ones, which are further classified into clathrinmediated, caveolae-mediated, clathrin-and caveolae-independent, and micropinocytosis processes [30]. In addition to these active transport mechanisms, nanoparticles can also penetrate cells through passive diffusion. Their physicochemical properties can significantly affect microglial modulation.

            "text": "Over the past few years, various types of nanoparticles, including magnetic [45][46][47], metallic [48][49][50], polymeric [51,52], quantum dots [53,54], carbon nanomaterials [55,56], dendrimers [57], and lipidic nanoparticles [58,59], have all been successfully designed for the treatment of cancer. Their distinct chemical, mechanical, electrical, optical, magnetic, electro-optical, and magneto-optical characteristics [41] make them attractive for biomedical applications, especially in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. However, despite numerous advancements, drug delivery systems (DDSs) still face safety challenges. As a result, safer DDSs of biocompatible substances, such as lipid carriers, are generally preferred. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles, consisting of various lipid components, have been proposed as safer candidates for cancer therapy due to their similarity to biomembranes and biocompatibility [60]. During the formulation phase of these nanocarriers, in vivo stability is crucial, as they encounter harsh conditions within the tumor microenvironment after administration. The interaction of nanoparticles with biological materials poses challenges for the transfer of lipid-based theranostic nanomedicine to clinics, given their potential toxicity or incompatibility. Toxicity depends on parameters such as nanoformulation solubility, size, and zeta potential [61]. Indeed, upon entering a biological system, nanoparticles tend to interact with proteins, resulting in the formation of a \"corona\" on their surface. This minimizes the surface energy of the nanomaterial, and significantly alters its chemical composition, physicochemical interactions, and biological responses [62]. For instance, nanoparticles that bind opsonins with high affinity are quickly cleared from the bloodstream [61]. Therefore, it is essential to functionalize surface nanoparticles in order to extend their blood circulation time and enhance their bioavailability. Hence, it is understood that the effective delivery of drugs or diagnostic markers to target cells relies on optimizing the design and structure of these nanodevices.",

            "text": "The size of aggregates may be dependent on the concentration and they tend to be slightly larger in culture media than in PBS. Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

            "text": "Nanomaterials adopt a new \"identity\" in the body through the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009). This phenomenon, known as bio-corona formation, is dependent upon intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials including size or surface curvature and surface chemistry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Tenzer et al., 2011) and on the physiological environment (i.e., the extracellular or intracellular milieu). Thus, the biological identity of nanomaterials is context dependent (Nystr\u00f6m & Fadeel, 2012). Importantly, while most publications are focused on the protein corona, one should not ignore other biomolecules including lipids, as lipid-binding proteins are commonly found in the bio-corona of nanoparticles (Hellstrand et al., 2009). \n\nThe environmental dimensions of the protein corona (often referred to as the \"eco-corona\") have been expertly covered (Wheeler et al., 2021) and will not be discussed here. \n\nIn our previous survey of bio-corona research, it was noted that we and others had deployed proteomics approaches to catalogue the proteins present on the surface of a wide range of nanomaterials including spherical particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) or polystyrene (PS) particles and fiber-like materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fadeel et al., 2013). The majority of these studies were carried out using human plasma or fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in many cases, several hundred proteins were identified in the biocorona (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, these results prompt several questions: first, why do so many different proteins congregate on the surface of nanoparticles? Indeed, as previously pointed out, it seems counterintuitive that \"proteins in the blood that evolved not to bind nonspecifically to each other would do so around nanoparticles\" (Lundqvist & Cedervall, 2020).",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

In these additional blood circulation assays, liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), 188kPa@lipid, and PLGA@lipid were used as the representatives for nanoparticles with extremely low ApoA1 abundance in corona, nanoparticles with appreciably high ApoA1 abundance in corona, and nanoparticles with intermediate ApoA1 abundance in corona, respectively; ApoA1 abundance in corona is observed to be ~0% for liposome, ~8% for PLGA@lipid, and ~26% for 188kPa@lipid (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a).

[28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

            "text": "In biological fluids, proteins bind to the surface of nanoparticles to form a biological coating around the nanoparticle, known as the protein corona. Over the time, this corona evolves and may modulate nanoparticle-induced processes such as opsonization which have direct consequences on the mode of interaction with cells, the efficacy of cellular NP uptake and thus, the organ targeting, biodistribution, and circulatio time of NP in vertebrates and non-vertebrates [22]. \n\nOur study indicates that the properties of the NP dictate the extent and specificity of protein binding profiles, which are complex, and in line with other studies may well consist of more than hundred different proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Albeit we did not perform a detailed identification of the protein corona composition by comprehensive proteomic methods, previous studies demonstrated that the coronae indeed contain (patho)biologically relevant proteins [22,[27][28][29]. Such proteins are not only involved in essential processes of the blood system and, thus, may act as opsonins or dysopsonins and modulate blood coagulation, but are also implicated in (cytoprotective) signal transduction pathways [22,28,29,46]. Facing the complexity of the plasma corona, one main challenge is clearly to determine to what extent the nanobiological effects observed are mediated directly by the biological activity of corona proteins, and to dissect the involved molecular mechanism. Additionally, the impact of the formation of a corona on transforming the primary properties of the formulated nanomaterials needs to be investigated. Notably, further studies need to consider also the impact of GI fluids or mucus on the biotransformation of ingested nanomaterials. Albeit these investigations will be challenging, the results of such studies are required to complete out understanding of the fate of nanomaterials in physiologically relevant environments. \n\nIn conclusion, based also on our study it is conceivable to speculate that depending on the type of nanomaterials the presence of proteins will have dual effects: For one, proteins may trigger the formation of a biologically active protein corona.",

This protein corona can cause instability, immune system recognition, or potentially beneficial adsorption of dysopsonins for prolonging circulation time (124). Feiner-Gracia et al. found that within a nanoparticle population there were significant differences in protein corona radius and identity, leading to the conclusion that even small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption to yield particles with distinct biological identity (84). Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (107,125). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (85). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (70). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation. Meanwhile, staining specific serum proteins with multiple fluorophores for SMLM visualisation enables quantification of the relative protein content in the corona formed on individual nanoparticle (126). \n\nBesides protein corona formation, there are many other nanoparticle-biological interactions that can be studied on a single particle level, including enzymatic changes to surface chemistry. SPARTA\u00ae was used to characterise the kinetics of enzymatic conversion of lipid headgroups from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid on a single particle level in Barriga et al. (69), including reaction kinetics (Fig. 5e). The ability to characterise stimuli-responsive compositional changes on the surface of nanoparticles provides the opportunity for optimisation of \"smart\" nanocarriers for targeted delivery prior to in vivo studies.",

            "text": "To fully explore the nanomaterial interactions with biological systems, we should take into account not only the \"synthetic identity\" of the nanomaterials (corresponding to their pristine, intrinsic nature), but also their \"biological identity\", acquired in biological media [14,112]. Indeed, upon contact with blood, biological fluids, or cell culture media, biomolecules contained in these fluids adsorb on the nanomaterial surface, forming a crown, a layer mainly composed of proteins, the so-called \"protein corona\". This new interface with biological systems will deeply impact the nanomaterial biological fate and response [113][114][115][116][117]. The composition of this protein corona is unique for each nanomaterial and influenced by the nanomaterial's intrinsic physicochemical features as well as by biological environmental factors. The protein corona is also characterized by its dynamic nature [14,114,117]. Indeed, its composition can vary over time following what is called the \"Vroman effect\" where the most abundant proteins adsorb first and are then replaced by proteins of higher affinity [118]. The protein corona composition also varies, especially in vivo, depending on its location in the organism as the nanomaterial passes from one biological compartment to another, each having its own distinct set of proteins that interact in a unique way with the nanomaterial [117]. \n\nThe characterization of the protein corona may be technically challenging, and a lack of reproducibility can also be mentioned. In addition, despite numerous works, no general rule can be established. Indeed, there is no universal corona; it is unique to each system as its formation depends both on the nanomaterial properties and the biological environment [65,117,119,120]. \n\nHowever, it is of paramount importance to take this component into account as it can deeply influence interactions with cells and the subsequent biological outcomes. Lesniak et al. showed that for identical particles and cells, under identical conditions, the interactions with cells and the biological outcomes could vary greatly in the presence or absence of a preformed corona in serum [121].",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

However, some properties such as surface charge, stability, biodegradability, or aggregation state can also be determined by the biological fluids (e.g., pH and ionic force). [25] The nanoparticles' surface properties are decisive in the affinity and degree of proteins to be adsorbed and also determine the forces that govern the nano-protein interface, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals (VDW), electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. [25] Nanomaterials with charged groups on their surface (e.g., carboxylic acid or amines) can trigger electrostatic interactions with ionized proteins. Although different ions are present in the bloodstream, normally the interaction of nanomaterials with macromolecules is comparatively more favorable and stable. VDW forces also occur, however they correspond to short-range and weak electrostatic attractions that are dependent on the positioning of the atoms at the nanoparticles' surface. [25,40,43,44] Additionally, hydrogen bonding can occur between polar residues on the nanoparticles' surface (e.g., hydroxyl groups) and hydrophilic uncharged regions present in proteins (e.g., serine, glutamine residues). Although these interactions are stronger than VDW forces, their frequency of occurrence is low in biological fluids. Moreover, hydrophobic interactions may also occur on the surface of certain materials (e.g., polystyrene). In addition to the chemical composition of the nanoparticle's surface, other physicochemical properties can affect protein adsorption. For example, smaller nanoparticles with greater curvature tend to promote higher protein adsorption (due to reduced interactions between proteins). Proteins with an isoelectric point >5. 5 have more affinity for positively charged nanoparticles, whereas proteins with an isoelectric point <5.5 have more affinity for negatively charged nanosystems.

            "text": "In the recent decade, the interest in polymeric nanocarriers for medical applications has gradually increased and accordingly a plethora of different nanoparticles have been fabricated. In particular when used as drug vectors in targeted delivery, nanocarriers could overcome many obstacles of cancer therapy. The possibility of a precise adjustment of nanocarriers' properties enables the development of specialized vectors. Nevertheless, their application is still impeded by insufficient knowledge about interactions of nanocarriers with their biological environment. \n\n2][3] This rapidly forming protein corona dramatically alters the nanocarriers' physicochemical properties including the hydrodynamic size, surface charge and aggregation behavior. Furthermore, the interaction with cell membranes and the mechanism of cellular uptake are controlled by the adsorbed proteins. Therefore, the corona defines the biological identity of nanoparticles, influencing cytotoxicity, body distribution and endocytosis into specific cells. 4,5 As it is often stated, when nanocarriers are introduced into the body, what the cells actually see is the protein corona. 1 Thus, the prediction of nanocarrier cell interactions is only possible if the protein corona is taken into account. \n\nApart from the nanocarrier surface properties, the protein corona composition is highly dependent on the biological environment. With regard to in vitro studies, experimental parameters such as cell culture medium, 6 protein concentration 7 and temperature 8 of the protein source are important factors in nanoparticle protein interactions. \n\nStudies analyzing the protein corona of nanocarriers in vitro utilize different types of protein sources and many do not further specify the type used or state reasons for their choice. Serum and plasma are often used in an interchangeable manner. The origin of the protein source, i.e. the species from which blood was drawn or the type of anticoagulant used for plasma generation is often neglected. 0][11] In contrast, serum is \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Complete list of proteins identified by LC-MS.

The adsorption of proteins to nanoparticle surface establish a protein corona has been given particular attention in the recent years, particularly within the context of nanomedicine targeting. Since many proteins are amphipathic, they have the potential to interact with almost any nanoparticle surface in their vicinity. Consequently, the interfacial interactions of nanoparticles with proteins are inevitable in such environments. In concordance, as expressed thermodynamically by D ads G < 0 (where D ads G symbolises the Gibbs free energy of adsorption), this mechanism of lowering the excess surface energy of nanoparticles is spontaneous. 40 The surface adsorption of serum proteins by particles (opsonisation) was \ue103rst postulated by Wright and Douglas in 1903. 41 Later in 1962, whilst assessing the surface adsorption of \ue103brinogen in blood plasma, Vroman noticed that the maximum surface concentration of \ue103brinogen was attained at an intermediate time point, suggestive of its substitution by other proteins with time. 42 Described by the Vroman effect, corona formation is a dynamic and competitive process. The initial stages of adsorption are dominated by small (high mobility), abundant proteins. However, with time, some of these proteins are substituted by those which are larger (low mobility), less abundant and have greater affinity for the surface. 43 An equilibrium is gradually attained, a\ue09der which each protein has equal rates of association and dissociation, and further exchange causes no change in the corona's composition. 44 As illustrated in Fig. 2, the protein corona branches into a 'hard corona' and 'so\ue09d corona'; these denote a \ue103rmly bound, equilibrium state layer (wherein proteins exhibit high affinity for the nanoparticle surface), and a loosely bound layer (comprised of low-affinity proteins in rapid exchange with those in the medium), respectively. 45,46 An intrinsic in\ue104uencer of protein corona composition is nanoparticle size.

The NPs are modelled by homogeneous spheres that interact with the beads of biomolecules via a central force that depends on the NP size. The proposed methodology is used to predict the adsorption energies for human blood plasma proteins on NPs of different sizes as well as the preferred orientation of the molecules upon adsorption. Our approach allows one to rank the proteins by their binding affinity to the NP, which can be used for predicting the composition of the NP-protein corona for the corresponding material. We also show how the model can be used for studying NP interaction with a lipid bilayer membrane and thus can provide a mechanistic insight for modelling NP toxicity.",

In the literature, unfolded proteins in the corona have been shown as causative to the aggregation of nanoparticles (36). \n\nThe top 50 most abundant coronal proteins were arranged in the heat map and classified into three clusters (Fig. 1D). For cluster I, the protein content showed a decreasing trend passing from the GNP B to the GNP BLC . Specifically, fibrinogens (FIBB, FIBG, and FIBA) displayed the most obvious downward trends (Fig. 1E). Signaling pathway analysis revealed that most proteins in the corona were related to the formation of fibrin clot (Fig. 1H). The protein concentrations in cluster II gradually increased as the particles transited from lysosomal to cytosolic solutions. These were mainly cellular component proteins, and the changes mainly occurred during the passage of GNPs from lysosomal to cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1F). Most of the acquired proteins were involved in glycolysis and glucose metabolism (Fig. 1I), which are essential processes to provide energy for cellular growth. This suggests that GNP B phagocytosis might affect the glycolysis process of cells. The concentrations of the proteins in cluster III first increased in lysosomal solutions and then decreased upon the subsequent entry of the nanoparticles to the cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1G). Innate immune system and complement pathway proteins were revealed as the major signaling pathways in which the proteins in cluster III were involved (Fig. 1J). These results suggested that the intracellular microenvironments interfered with the initial protein corona on the GNPs acquired from blood and that the release of blood proteins from the particle surface inside the cell (following their displacement by cellular components) might modulate cellular signaling and disturb subsequent physiological cellular processes. Deficiencies in proteostasis have been shown to facilitate the progression of numerous diseases, such as lysosomal storage disease, cystic fibrosis, amyloidogenesis, as well as cancer (37)(38)(39). Consequences of blood proteins being released from the GNP corona intracellularly are explored next.",

            "text": "Traditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system. But the protein corona also plays an active role in deciding the destination organ for delivery and accumulation of the particles. For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. ( 80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81). These are exciting and promising results for improving the delivery of iLNP beyond these organs, and other relationships between lipid composition and biodistribution should be carried out in the future. Active targeting by grafting a specific moiety, that is, the ligand of an over-expressed receptor onto the NP surface, is a very appealing strategy that, to this day, fails to impact the biodistribution drastically. However, once the NPs have reached the organs, their uptake can be influenced by targeting moieties (75)",

On this basis, mapping the wear debris' corona could contribute to the engineering of better-tolerated materials. \n\nIn the last years, research on protein corona involve proteomics, immunology characterization and nanotoxicology, with many published articles exploring the effects of well-defined biological media (protein dispersions, sera, etc.) on well-characterized nanoparticles [57,58]. Protein corona characterization of nanoparticles is based on single-step gradient centrifugations that are simple procedures based on the different densities of biological species and most exogenous nanoparticles. \n\nUpon their extraction, qualitative and quantitative assessments on nanoparticles, the examination of their biomolecular corona should provide a detailed characterization of the chemical-biological interaction of nanoparticles with the plasma proteins of human blood.",

Alternatively, PS contains a negatively charged phosphate group attached to the serine group, giving it an overall negative charge, mainly due to the low (2.2-3.6) pKa of the carboxyl group within the serine [42]. More recently, there is increased research interest in formulations of lipid-drug (or photosensitizer) conjugates to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of liposomal therapeutics [43][44][45][46][47]. Similarly, the incorporation of PEG, a polymeric steric stabilizer, is widely used to increase the blood circulation time of liposomal formulations [48,49]. The addition of PEG into liposomal doxorubicin extended the terminal half-life from 16.4 h to 77 h in patients with metastatic breast cancer [50,51]. Once liposomes enter the bloodstream, plasma proteins interact with and adsorb onto the liposome surface. It has been previously shown that the liposomal surface chemistry (e.g., charge and pegylation) impacts the blood protein adsorption (known as the \"protein corona\"), which influences how liposomes interact with healthy and diseased cells [52][53][54]. Protein adsorption occurs due to an advantageous increase in entropy, resulting in a decrease in Gibbs free energy (\u2206G abs ) [55]. A comprehensive study by Hadjidemetriou et al. examined the in vitro and in vivo protein corona formation on three different types of liposomes, including pegylated liposomes, non-pegylated liposomes, and monoclonal antibody-conjugated liposomes [56]. In this study, pegylated liposomes had the lowest protein adsorption at~10,000 \u00b5g protein/\u00b5M lipid, while non-pegylated liposomes had double the amount of protein adsorption. However, all liposomes had relatively consistent protein corona compositions, with the most abundant bound proteins being apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, and complement proteins.\n\nWhile the topic of nanoparticle-protein adsorption is",

We found by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy measurements that the increase in the diameter for the PSNP-protein bioconjugates depends on both nanoparticle size and type of proteins. Our circular dichroism spectroscopy results demonstrate that the proteins preserve their structures when they interact with PSNPs at physiological temperature. Quartz crystal microbalance technique revealed that PSNPs and their bioconjugates show no strong interactions with SLBs. On the contrary, the molecular dynamics simulations showed that both proteins strongly bind to the lipid bilayer when compared to the binding of proteins to a PS surface model. The interaction was strongly dependent on the protein and lipid bilayer composition. Both the PSNPs and their bioconjugates show no toxicity in HUVEC cells; however, bare 210\u00a0nm PSNPs and 50\u00a0nm PSNP-transferrin bioconjugates showed an increase in the ROS production. Our study may be relevant for assessing different types of plastics and their impact on health. We investigated using experimental and theoretical methods the impact of polystyrene nanoparticle size on protein corona formation with human blood proteins and the interaction of nanoparticle-protein bioconjugates with supported lipid bilayers.

            "text": "Above we have described the NPs' characteristics, including their surface properties and aggregation state. As the aggregation state is determined by the surface chemistry, we will turn our attention to the biomolecular corona. Previous studies have mainly focused on the protein corona, but the corona also contains lipids [8,51,52] and likely carbohydrates. At low NP concentration levels, determining the biomolecular corona is a challenge. However, by combining the pellets, formed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, from 5 experiments, sufficient amount of material could be obtained for analysis by SDS-PAGE, S8 Fig, and mass spectrometry (see materials and methods for details). We identified several proteins (S1 Table ) in the Au NPs' corona, of which many have been previously described in the literature [31]. Proteins of a very broad size range are found on the NP surface or incorporated in complexes with the NP and other proteins. Alpha- 2-macroglobulin is the largest protein found in the corona. It has a molecular weight of 725 kDa and its dimensions are approximately 10 nm in diameter and 15-20 nm in length [53]. The protein is therefore of similar size to the smaller Au NPs and will considerably change the size and density of the NP protein complex. The lower density slows down the sedimentation rate, resulting in a smaller apparent diameter of the complex by DCS. Lipid binding proteins as apolipoprotein E and gelsolin were also found in the corona. It has been shown for polymeric and TiO 2 NPs that the lipids remain on the NP surface after binding and even have a preferential binding compared to other proteins [8,51,52]. Bound lipids will significantly change the complex' density. Apolipoprotein E is part of the lipoprotein particle chylomicrons which transport lipids in blood from the intestine. The density of chylomicrons is less than 1 g/cm 3 and their size can be more than a micrometer. The low NP concentration made it impossible to determine the lipid concentration in the pellet.",

            "text": "For a deeper understanding of protein corona formation under physiological conditions it is essential to identify the underlying individual factors governing the corona under these conditions. In 2011, Tenzer and colleagues discovered that the size of the particles alone is a critical physicochemical determinant of the human blood plasma corona [8]. They could show that even differences in silica nanoparticle (SiNP) size of only 10 nm significantly affected the protein corona composition around three different SiNPs (with diameters of about 20, 30, and 110 nm). One strategy to interpret their results was to classify the SiNP-specific protein signatures, as identified by quantitative mass spectrometry, by their calculated isoelectric point (Figure 5). \n\nAt the physiological pH of blood plasma (pH 7.3), preferential binding of negatively charged proteins (pI < 7) onto the SiNP surfaces was reported. The protein size also played a significant role: While proteins with a high molecular mass were enriched on the NP surfaces as compared to their abundance in the plasma, proteins with low molecular mass were less abundant in the corona than in the surrounding plasma (Figure 5c,d). \n\nOf all identified corona proteins 37% showed significant differences in their binding behavior towards the NP surface as the NP size was altered. The proteins that show such size dependence in their adsorption behavior are involved in all kinds of biological processes, hence, they could not be attributed to a functional class. Interestingly, they were able to identify individual proteins (e.g., prothrombin or gelsolin) showing a higher affinity for larger SiNPs (110 nm) but also other proteins (e.g., clusterin) with higher affinities to smaller SiNPs (20 nm). \n\nMany other proteins such as immunoglobulin (Ig) G or actin showed no dependence on the NP size. The complexity of protein corona formation under physiological conditions is impressively emphasized by this study: A single physical parameter such as the NP size can dramatically change the composition of the protein corona around NPs that are otherwise identical. Intriguingly, the detailed evaluation of the data did not confirm the previously suggested [22,43,160,161] trivial link between the binding profiles on the NPs and the relative protein concentrations in the plasma.",

The MPS is comprised primarily of blood monocytes, tissue macrophages, dendritic cells, and bone marrow progenitor cells which reside mainly in the vital organs (e.g., lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen). The design of long circulation evades opsonization and diverts a fraction of nanocarriers to organs and tissues beyond the MPS 93,190 . \n\nThe sequestration of nanocarriers from blood involves sequential steps, including blood circulation, marginalization, firm attachment, and cell internalization 191 . Serum albumin complements, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins, among other plasma proteins, bind to nanocarrier surfaces and form \"protein corona (PC)\". Depending on surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and functionalization (e.g., with ligands), as well as size, shape, and zeta potential, the \"PC\" defines the physiological features of nanomedicines. Following internalization and binding to specific phagocyte receptors, protein-coated nanocarriers are delivered to the phagosomes before lysosomal fusion. The spleen, liver, and lymph nodes contain macrophages responsible for this process. Opsonization is a crucial step that determines the pharmacological and toxicological effects of nanomedicines. As reported, opsonization can also influence the functionality of targeting ligands, resulting in a lack of selectivity. Salvati et al. 192 found that transferrin (Tf)-decorated silica nanoparticles did not bind to Tf receptors (TfR) on A549 cells or soluble TfR, demonstrating how opsonization prevents ligand/receptor binding and results in a loss of specificity. In-depth analysis has connected the physicochemical properties of particles such as size and surface charge with PC formation 193,194 .

            "text": "When the hybrid nanoparticles enter the body, they can easily absorb biological molecules in biological fluids (such as blood and peritoneal fluid) and form the protein corona layer [225][226][227]. This protein-coated structure will lead to a series of changes such as reduced surface energy and increased steric hindrance of hybrid nanoparticles, which not only dramatically conceals the intrinsic properties of the hybrid nanoparticles itself, but may also endue new physicochemical properties [228,229]. For example, protein corona formed in the early stage affects the absorption, targeting and distribution of particles and tends to lead to hemolysis or endothelial cell death [230][231][232]. Therefore, for actively targeted nanomedicines, this may also be an important reason for their poor performance in clinical trials [233].\n\nIn order to reduce the negative effects of protein corona, researchers tried to change the composition, shape, surface charge and other factors of hybrid nanoparticles to avoid the formation of protein corona [234][235][236]. In addition, it should be noted that the disease variability and heterogeneity, as well as individual differences of patients, lead to different effects of protein corona [237]. We also noticed that the role of protein corona is not necessarily negative [238,239]. Therefore, it is more necessary for researchers to make in-depth and comprehensive explorations in related fields, including biological interface behavior.",

The hard corona is the initial tightly bound layer of proteins, whereas the soft corona refers to the outer layer of proteins (not directly bound to the NPs). 165 The presence of protein coronas may trigger immune responses, leading to the rapid degradation of the macrophage phagocytic system and nonspecific cellular uptake, further affecting drug efficacy and targeting. 166,167 on-ionic surfactants can reduce the nonspecific adsorption of proteins onto nanoparticles, thereby decreasing the formation of protein coronas, which may be owing to the formation of hydrophilic shells on the surface of the nanoparticles, resulting in reduced protein-binding affinity. Additionally, when surfactants strongly bind with nanoparticles, it is difficult for proteins to displace them. 168 PEGylation is the conventional method used to reduce protein adsorption. PEGylated drugs and nanocarriers exhibit extended half-lives in the blood and reduced nonspecific cellular uptake compared with unmodified drugs. 169,170 However, PEG, which is a nonbiodegradable polyether, may accumulate in the body upon prolonged use of drug-PEG conjugates, leading to potential adverse effects. 171,172 Therefore, finding alternatives to PEG is crucial, and non-ionic surfactants have gained attention owing to their non-toxicity and biocompatibility. Mueller et al employed the non-ionic surfactant polyphosphoester (PPE) to coat nanoparticles, offering a simplified approach for modulating protein coronas and their biological effects. After incubation with plasma, protein adsorption on the nanoparticles coated with PPE decreased, and the uptake by the macrophages was reduced. 168 n addition, non-ionic surfactants may influence the composition and structure of the protein corona, thereby altering the interactions of nanoparticles with cells or other biomolecules (Figure 4).",

NPs exerting their intracellular or extracellular biological activities after being recognized and endocytosed by macrophages (Figure 2) (46,47,55,70). Plasma contains various proteins, which can bind to the nanoparticles (NPs), and once NPs enter the host and contact with plasma proteins, they acquire a new biological characteristic called protein corona (PC) (71). PC changes the physicochemical properties of NPs, including The various properties of nanomaterials in nanomedicines. Nanomaterials are subdivided into polymorphic nanoparticles (NPs), liposomes, biomimetic NPs, inorganic NPs, and cell-derived exosomes, which range in size from approximately 1 to 100 nm and have different shapes, including nanospheres, nanorods, nanostars, nanocubes, nanodisks, etc.; consist of different materials, including SPIONs, metallic fabrics, and organic materials; and are both positively/negatively charged on the surface or coated by PEG. These physicochemical properties influence how efficiently nanomaterials enter the cell and the mode of action that affects cellular activity. The size and shape of the nanomaterial can determine the way it enters the cell, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (120nm), and clathrin-and caveolae-independent endocytosis (~60nm) (51).. The surface charge of nanoparticles affects the cell membrane state, for example, the binding of negatively charged nanoparticles to cellular lipid bilayers causes local gelation, while the binding of positively charged nanoparticles to cellular lipid bilayers causes the flow of phospholipid bilayers (52).",

We noted a transition from a unimodal size distribution of liposomes in PBS buffer to a multimodal size distribution after extended incubation with 10% FBS. This caused sharp increases in the PDI of both formulations with increases in size and polydispersity (PDI) being greater for the target-lipo vesicles. \n\nThe emergence of particle populations with different sizes is not unexpected considering that FBS represents a complex, concentrated cocktail of polydisperse proteins of different sizes [27]. Indeed, the surface properties of various nanoparticles have been shown to change dramatically in the presence of plasma or serum [28] with the establishment of an adsorbed protein corona around the nanoparticle. It is now widely accepted that the particle protein corona presents a new biomolecular interface that underpins the dynamic interactions of nanosystems and their biological targets. The presentation of a high affinity GRPR antagonist peptide on the liposomal surface is expected to maintain liposomal cell-binding affinity by virtue of its high affinity for the receptor. Although, steric blockade of the targeting motif is possible due to the dynamic exchange events association with the evolution of the hard and soft corona, even on pegylated liposomes.",

            "text": "It can be divided into two categories: a \"hard\" corona, and a \"soft\" corona. The \"soft\" corona is based on abundant proteins that firstly bind to the nanoparticle through low-affinity bonds, and the \"hard\" corona is more dense [17], based on sparse proteins that replace the \"soft\" proteins over time, due to their higher affinity bonds [11], which is known as the Vroman effect [18]. The composition of the corona is directly dependent on the biomolecular composition of the physiological environment that surrounds it [19,20], the time of exposure [11,17,21], and also incubation conditions (such as temperature or mild stirring), among others. Moreover, it is clear that the protein corona is not static and varies in the course of time; in other words, it's dynamic [17,21]. Eventually, it will reach a state of equilibrium, steady stochastic state, where the association and dissociation rates for each protein occur equally [21], unless it is further incubated in a different biological media or proximal biological fluid, with a formation of a new corona [22]. The great majority of the proteins that form the corona are independent of the size and surface charge of the nanoparticle but are very influenced by the chemical properties of the material that constitutes the nanoparticle [23]. However, there are still sensitive proteins to size and surface charge, whose nature can change and consequently alter the interactions between nanoparticles and cells with the consequent alteration of the biological outcome and biological impacts [23]. For instance, if opsonins bind to the nanoparticle in the protein corona, they will be recognized as a \"threat,\" and consequently are phagocytosed by macrophages [24]. It is crucial to prevent opsonization, \"camouflage\" the nanoparticle to avoid the phagocytosis, and keep the nanoparticles in circulation, which can be achieved by the application of a polymer coating, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [25].",

            "text": "Corona. Different physicochemical properties, not only size, may determine the ability of nanoparticles to reach the brain. The situation is further complicated by the formation of a so-called \"corona\" of biomolecules on the surfaces of nanoparticles, the composition of which may vary depending on the route of exposure, and on the physicochemical surface properties of NPs. The acquisition of a corona of biomolecules on the surface of NPs may also determine whether NPs are able to cross from one compartment to another and whether they are taken up effectively by cells or not [156]. \n\nIn practical situations in which nanoparticles interact with living organisms, the nanoparticle surfaces are initially exposed to a biological fluid, such as blood, depending on the route of administration. For instance, NPs injected intravenously would be exposed to blood plasma, containing an excess of proteins and many other complex biomolecules, which bind competitively with the surface of the nanoparticles. \n\nThe current idea is that \"bare\" nanoparticles do not exist in vivo, because they are immediately modified by the adsorption of blood proteins with higher affinities for the particle surface, forming a more or less tightly bound layer (the so-called hard corona) and a weakly associated mobile layer (the so-called soft corona). When this issue was investigated, it has been found that typical coronas contain a limited number and types of molecules gathered from the blood, in spite of the fact that biological fluids contain thousands of proteins [157]. Moreover, it should be noted that the corona may also play a role in other undesirable effects of NPs in living systems such as complement activation and blood clotting and may not necessarily play a role only in cellular uptake. \n\nIt should be pointed out that none of the in vitro experiments conducted to study the process of NPs translocation to the brain takes into account the surface modification of NPs inside the blood and how can this affect the crossing of the BBB. This issue needs much further investigation.",

            "text": "In parallel to the protein group analysis, serum albumin was found to be by far the most abundant corona protein for every nanocarrier formulation. While serum albumin presence was detected in the range of 48% (5 kDa PEG-DBCO) to 72% (mgHES), the other six most abundant proteins were observed with a relative abundance of less than 7% each. The whole mouse plasma control group showed a comparable distribution with the most abundant proteins (Figure S6). \n\nApart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3-induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1). Multi-angle dynamic light scattering revealed a larger size of pristine nanocarriers compared to the PEGylated formulations in protein-free media, and a smaller particle size under protein corona conditions. This might be due to changes in the light scattering properties and/or a reduction in aggregation after PEGylation. Regarding the surface charge of the nanocarriers, all samples presented a rather neutral zeta potential, which consistently appeared slightly negative for all mouse plasma pre-incubated nanocarrier formulations.",

            "text": "Moreover, the size of corona particle was observed to be 5 nm larger than the bare nanoparticle (Figure 4e). The hydrodynamic diameter of corona particles was found to increase by 50 nm compared to thebare nanoparticles (Figure 4f). \n\nThe hard corona of sulphonated polystyrene (PSOSO 3 H, 100 nm, 200 nm) and SiO 2 (50 nm) nanoparticles are shown in Figure 5a-c. For bare PSOSO 3 H particles of diameter 100 nm in PBS, the monomer was consistent with the TEM image (Figure 5A) but the particle monomer peak was absent in the plasma mixture and the plasma intrinsic peak grew rapidly. The large cluster formation associated with a larger amount of protein (NP-protein complex) was confirmed in 100 nm sulfonated polystyrene, as shown in the TEM images, compared to the carboxylated NPs, where only a thin protein layer and no monomer complexes were detected (Figure 5B) [19]. The exposed charge surface of NPs in the biological milieu is a prominent feature for the determination of PC and their type of formation. The composition of PC is affected by the presence of the surface charge of NPs and their interaction with biomolecules restrains the fate of protein adsorption kinetics. To elucidate the impact of the surface charge of NPs on corona formation, Lundqvist and coworkers used polystyrene NPs withpositive (+) amine and negative (\u2212) carboxyl terminals incubated separately in human plasma and estimated the influence of the surface charge as a significant outcome [34]. The proteins susceptible to positive NPs were apolipoprotein F, mannose binding proteins, complement C1r, and the proteins susceptible to negatively charged NPs were majority of the Ig-gamma and Ig-kappa proteins. \n\nIn spite of the protein adsorption over the surface of NPs, the zeta potential remained unaltered in the range of \u221210 to \u221220 mV, indicating autonomous control over the physicochemical properties.",

            "text": "Interactions between the nanomaterial and various cells and/or biomolecules can be advantageous, neutral, or toxic depending on its functional groups [86]. Functional group modification can change the surface hydrophobicity, surface charge, and charge density of nanomaterials, which affect protein adsorption, cellular uptake, and biological fate [87][88][89]. Different functional groups of nanomaterials can alter their toxic mechanisms in organisms (Fig. 2c) [89]. The relative surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the nanoparticle influences protein adsorption, cellular permeability, cellular uptake, biological fate, and toxicity. Upon contact with a biological fluid (e.g., blood or plasma), nanomaterials can bind to proteins to form a nanoparticle-protein corona [67]. Plasma proteins control the cellular uptake and biological fate of nanoparticles since they are linked to phagocytosis [90]. Protein adsorption was greater for hydrophobic nanomaterials than hydrophilic ones [91]. Hydrophobic gold nanoparticles were internalized more quickly and induced greater cytotoxicity to THP-1 macrophage cells than hydrophilic gold nanoparticles [92]. Simulations using the synthetic supported lipid bilayer (SLB) membrane showed that semi-hydrophobic carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene nanoparticles adsorbed to the SLB, drawing lipids away and creating lipid-poor regions 'pores' in the SLB, thereby increasing membrane permeability [93]. In addition, hydrophobic gold nanoparticles generated ROS in HeLa cells via NADPH oxidase activation [94]. \n\nSurface charge and charge density also influence protein adsorption, cellular uptake rate, and membrane integrity. Adsorption of plasma proteins increased with surface charge density [95]. Cationic particles attach to the cell surface more easily than neutral or anionic nanoparticles due to electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged membrane bilipid layer [96]. The positively charged nanoparticles can disrupt the cell membrane potential and ultimately damage the lipid bilayer [97].",

            "text": "Nanotechnological products' rapid diffusion has given rise to concerns about the possible adverse effects following the direct or indirect exposure of humans to nanoparticles (NPs) [1][2][3]. Due to their high surface to volume ratios, engineered nanoparticles exhibit chemical, physical and biological properties that differ from their bulk material forms, which may lead to adverse effects on human health and environmental systems [4]. Since the toxicological and environmental effects of these compounds are not fully known, there remains a need for understanding their health and environmental impacts, nanoparticles' life cycles, human exposure routes, nanoparticles' behaviour inside the body, the risk to those who work with nanoparticles and approaches for safely handling and using nanomaterials [5][6][7]. The interactions of nanomaterials' functional biomolecules are considered preconditions for cytotoxicity and organ toxicity, and in this context, various proteins have been investigated over the past years [8]. Due to the possibilities created by nanomedicine [9], nano-TiO 2 was tested as a nanomaterial together with human serum albumin (HSA) as a representative blood protein. \n\nThe engineered nanomaterials' interactions with molecules in biological fluids (mainly proteins) presents an extremely relevant process that leads to a nano-bio interface, as elucidated over the past few years [3]. This interface, which is primarily constituted of systemic circulation proteins and phospholipids in the lung [10,11] is not a static process, but a range of continuous associations and dissociations, where events at a certain point reach an equilibrium [12]. The final composition of the external coating, called the protein corona, is determined by size and the surface properties of the engineered nanomaterials, as well as by protein-protein interactions [13]. Nanoparticles' blood protein interactions are considered the most critical events for determining the fate of nanoparticles in the body. The blood protein-nanoparticle surface affinity regulates this interaction and may trigger adverse responses such as thrombosis and inflammation [14].",

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

            "text": "The characterization of protein corona variable composition as a function of nanoparticle physicochemical properties (size, surface charge, morphology, etc.) cannot be assessed without reproducible and upright LC-MS analyses and datasets. For instance, researchers examined the interactions between proteins and nanoparticles and the effect of small changes in surface chemistry on these interactions using SDS-PAGE and LC-MS for protein separation and quantification, respectively [25]. The obtained results demonstrated that, for most of the proteins studied, their relative quantities were lower when nanoparticles were present. However, it should be noted that the identification of proteins by mass spectrometry was only performed once, which may exaggerate the differences between particle types. Thus, despite the central role of LC-MS in NPPC studies, the biological and technical variations can significantly compromise the reproducibility of analyses. \n\nValidity of proteomics results depend on the robustness and reproducibility of preparation and characterization methods and can be compromised by biological and technical variations. Proteomics results are also dependent on the variability of identified proteins, which critically depends on the LC-MS instrumentation and data analysis approach [36]. Protein corona impurities (dependent on nanoparticle size) can be a significant source of contamination that may cause errors in proteomics analysis [40]. Unfortunately, the LC-MS technique suffers from variability in the proteomics datasets, which depend not only on the instrumentation, but also on the core facility [18,36]. This variability may lead to misinterpretation of NPPC biological, biomedical, therapeutical, or toxicological effects. Accordingly, protein quantification remains a challenge due to inherent limitations in LC-MS, the complex composition of the protein corona, and the lack of standard approaches. Different labs have access to different instrumentation, equipment, and software, which can affect data processing workflows and relative protein quantification. In this regard, the recent study of Ashkarran et al. is particularly relevant [18]. They carried out an interlaboratory study to determine the influence of different LC-MS/MS workflows in the analysis of identical aliquots of NPPCs by sending them to different proteomics facilities across the USA.",

            "text": "Their ability to cross the plasma membrane and their high surface area made them suitable to carry various bioactive agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs (Morais et al. 2020;Lyra et al. 2021;Zhang et al. 2021). Many studies were focused on their covalent functionalization with biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), to overcome MWCNTs limitations due to their toxicity and their tendency to aggregate in biological fluids (Tan et al. 2020;Yumita et al. 2020;Solhjoo et al. 2021). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the coating of DAAO with PEG enhances the enzyme stability, favoring the production of hydrogen peroxide over time (Rosini and Pollegioni 2020;Nakamura et al. 2021). \n\nAnother important aspect, to evaluate after administration of a nanocarrier into the human body bloodstream, is the interaction between the nanosystem and biological fluids components, essential to the formation of the 'protein corona' (PC), also called 'bio-corona', around nanoparticles. The formation of PC is a dynamic process, that involves many weak forces between physiological proteins and nanoparticles' surface (Fasoli 2021;Kopac 2021;Li et al. 2021). Protein corona composition and thickness are influenced by both nanoparticles features (such as dimension, morphology and surface properties) and environmental features (like biological fluid composition, pH and temperature). The bio-corona is able to affect nanoparticles properties, influencing their biodistribution and their targeting capacity (Nicoletti et al. 2018;Huang et al. 2021;Tengjisi et al. 2022). PC could be divided into two main layers: 'soft corona' (SC) and 'hard corona' (HC). Proteins belonging to HC directly bind nanoparticles surface with high affinity, generating a stable and nonexchangeable layer. HC is responsible of nanoparticle fate by controlling membrane adhesion, cellular signaling pathways, biodistribution and interactions with surrounding cells.",

            "text": "Accordingly, any attempt to engineer NPs for biomedical applications must take this inevitable modification into account. The processes occurring during formation of this interfacial layer are exceedingly complicated, however, and even fundamental issues are still under debate. \n\nThe physical nature of the protein corona is largely governed by the (surface) properties of the NPs and by the types and (relative) amounts of biomolecules (and their individual properties) present in the biofluid [13e16]. Moreover, it is affected by external factors such as incubation time, temperature, shear forces due to flow (e.g. in vitro in reactors or in vivo in the bloodstream), and may even reflect the history of the entire trajectory taken by a NP migrating through different compartments of an organism [12,17e20]. For any biomedical application of NPs, e.g. as drug carriers, it is crucially important to understand corona formation at the molecular level, so that it becomes possible to control and predict its effects on the biological environment [21]. The physicochemical properties of the NP surfaces greatly affect protein adsorption and thereby control the properties of the biomolecular corona, which mediates the interaction between nanomaterials and the biological environment. The physical nature of the corona depends on the detailed history of the biofluid exposure (e.g. in vitro vs. in vivo), the type of organism and even the health status of a patient. \n\nMany useful reviews have appeared in recent times addressing NPs for biomedical applications and the implications of protein corona formation for NP engineering [12,22e27]. Here we have not aimed at contributing yet another exhaustive review. We instead focus on three different areas that deem particularly important for further advancement of NPs for biomedical applications. After a brief sketch introducing important aspects of the protein corona, we first address fundamental physicochemical issues of protein corona formation, which have been explored in in-vitro studies, with a special focus on the underlying mechanistic details. Second, we present recent examples of how a molecular-scale understanding can be used to control the nature of the protein corona, enabling the engineering of NPs with advantageous properties for nanomedicine applications.",

Due to their attractive surface charges, the proteins can be electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of nanocarriers, which is known as protein corona, hereby changing the nanocarriers' surface properties, covering the targeting moieties and finally impacting cellular uptake. 22 Therefore, the effect of the protein corona was studied in terms of toxicity, uptake and protein pattern as well as protein identification to understand the uptake behavior, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. SiNCs were incubated with human serum (HS) prior to adding them to CD8 + T-cells in medium containing different percentages of HS. The results indicate that the protein corona reduced the toxicity for all SiNCs compared to uncoated NCs ( Figure 4A). It was also found that the medium containing a higher percentage of HS contributed to enhancement of cell viability similar to previous study. 25 However, the uptake was dramatically decreased in all cases compared to the uncoated NCs, together with increasing of %HS in the medium, especially at 10% HS ( Figure 4B). These results suggest that the uptake of SiNCs in CD8 + T-cells was inhibited by the adsorbed protein forming protein corona, which can be observed from the pre-coated NCs. In addition, the different concentrations of serum might result in differences in corona composition leading to a decreased uptake with increasing  serum concentration. For gold nanoparticles, it was found that the corona inhibited caveolae-mediated endocytosis resulting in decreased uptake in human epidermal keratinocytes. 40 After forming the protein corona, the physicochemical properties of SiNCs were analyzed. Overall, the hydrodynamic size increased for all SiNCs (Table S1, Supporting Information). The \u03b6-potential after corona was about \u221220 mV for NCs as the surface was saturated with a high amount of adsorbed proteins (Table S1, Supporting Information). There were no significant differences in the surface charges after corona formation of the various nanoparticles, which was also reported in the literature. 41 In order to understand the reason for the inhibited cellular",

            "text": "In the natural fluidic environment of a biological system, nanoparticles (NPs) experience chaotic adhesion of plasma proteins forming \"protein corona\" (PC) whose composition and kinetics determine the fate of NPs manifested as aggregation, clusterization, sedimentation due to gravity, and coupling to a flow [1]. The NP properties determine the protein binding profile that can cause the change in nanoparticle size, shape, surface charge. This biological coating determines NP interaction with biological milieu, including cellular uptake, safety profile [2] and residence time in blood circulation [3]. The residence time in blood circulation depends on the protein corona formed on NPs is recognized by the mononuclear phagocyte system-this process is termed \"opsonization\" and results in nanoparticle sequestration after the intravenous injection [4,5]. To endow NPs with stealth properties, surface engineering can reduce the adsorption of opsonins, evading the phagocyte system in vivo and aids development nanomedicine with less side effects caused by non-specific protein binding. Engineering NPs that can specifically bind certain proteins of interest (precoating the NPs with proteins or capturing specific serum proteins) for targeting purposes, can enhance the development of nanoparticles as drug delivery. \n\nUpconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were chosen as a nanoparticle model due to their unique photoluminescent properties. Upconversion nanoparticles hold promise for broad applications in the life sciences due to their unique properties-conversion of nearinfrared light into photoluminescence of the shorter wavelength (ultraviolet, visible or nearinfrared) [6]. This property found a range of applications in highly sensitive biodetection by using near-infrared excitation to minimize the background signal and enhance the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Narrow multicolor emission, exceptional photostability, and low cytotoxicity represent the properties that confer UCNP advantageous in multiplexing and long-term detection in biological settings.",

            "text": "The effectiveness of nanomedicine therapeutic strategies is strictly dependent on the design of the nano formulation since by modulating nanoparticle physicochemical properties it is possible to discriminate between healthy and diseased cells and predict the mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular targeting. However, the translation from in vitro to in vivo studies and from theory to practice is often affected by the complexity of the biological systems with which nanoparticles interact [96]. In personalized medicine, these factors need to be carefully taken into consideration, indeed, drug targeting could be highly affected on the basis of age, sex, target tissues and organs, metabolic differences, and concomitant diseases that can alter different biological parameters. For instance, after systemic administration, nanoparticles are often altered in their outer surface properties by the absorption of serum proteins that can mask the presence of ligands grafted in the nanoparticle surface necessary for a specific cellular targeting. The absorbed proteins, known also as protein corona, could drastically change the characteristics of the nano formulation with consequent hampered cellular uptake, inactivation, and premature elimination [97]. The impact of protein corona formation can be partially overcome by the engineering of nanoparticles possessing a zwitterionic charge in their surface and a global hydrophobic nature [98] or by the insertion of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains with low molecular weight [99]. \n\nBertrand and co-workers tried to understand how the physicochemical properties of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and their interaction with plasma resident proteins could modulate the biodistribution and clearance [100]. The authors found that a low PEG density reduces the nanoparticle clearance whereas a higher PEGylation determines an opposite effect. Interestingly, a total number of 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 represents a threshold value beyond which the circulation time and clearance of the nanoparticle remain almost the same independently from the nanoparticle size. In addition, this threshold value was found to be consistent in organisms possessing different protein phenotypes. On the other hand, the nature of the proteins composing the protein corona varies on the basis of the steric properties of the nanoparticle surface, with a consequent different impact on the circulation time.",

            "text": "They are nanoparticles composed mainly of ionized lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids, with encapsulated mRNA [3,12,13]. LNPs provide efficient cellular uptake by endocytosis and release of internalized mRNA into the cytoplasm by promoting escape from the endosomes and protecting mRNA from degradation by RNase. \n\nmRNA-LNP formulations have been indicated to require strict controls, including the need to maintain fairly low temperatures during transport and storage [12,13]. It has been reported that when mRNAs alone are stored at room temperature, there is a slight decrease in translation efficiency in vitro, even after 14 days under conditions in which RNase is strictly removed [14]. In contrast, it has been reported that external physical stimuli may cause nanoparticle aggregation and mRNA release from nanoparticles, which significantly reduces the translation efficiency [15]. Since it is a new pharmaceutical modality, there is a lack of information on the systematic investigation of how storage conditions affect the physicochemical properties of mRNA-LNPs and their protein expression ability. \n\nIn this study, we selected a lipid formulation with ionized lipid DLin-MC3-DMA as our standard LNP. The lipid composition as ionized lipid: DSPC: Cholesterol: DMG-PEG2000 = 50:10:38.5:1.5 mol% is developed siRNA-LNP formulation for Onpattro by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals [16]. This composition has been described as a benchmark for nucleic acid-encapsulated LNPs [17] and is widely referenced, including Moderna's vaccine. We selected various physical conditions that may affect storage stability throughout the entire process, from production in a factory to inoculation, referring to those listed by Kis Z [18], and exposed mRNA-LNP to these conditions to investigate their effects on physicochemical properties and protein expression ability.",

The protein corona (PrC), formed on the NP surface, represents an interface between biological components and NPs, dictating their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. PrC composition depends on biological environments around NPs and on their intrinsic physicochemical properties. We generated different formulations of non-ionic surfactant/non-phospholipid vesicles, called niosomes (NIOs), using polysorbates which are biologically safe, cheap, non-toxic and scarcely immunogenic. PrC composition and relative protein abundance for all designed NIOs were evaluated ex vivo in human plasma (HP) by quantitative label-free proteomics. We studied the correlation of the relative protein abundance in the corona with cellular uptake of the PrC-NIOs in healthy and cancer human cell lines. Our results highlight the effects of polysorbates on nano-bio interactions to identify a protein pattern most properly aimed to drive the NIO targeting in vivo, and assess the best conditions of PrC-NIO NP uptake into the cells. This study dissected the biological identity in HP of polysorbate-NIOs, thus contributing to shorten their passage from preclinical to clinical studies and to lay the foundations for a personalized PrC.",

Depending on the NP size, chemistry or surface potential, the proteins can have different affinity for the NP surface, leading to the formation of a hard or a soft protein-corona, 8 which are defined by different dissociation constant, it being higher for the hard protein-corona, with respect to soft one. 9,10 The wettability properties of the NPs can also affect the formation of protein-corona by changing its relative affinity, association, and dissociation rates. 11 n this study, we investigate the formation of the proteincorona on aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO) and gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor NPs by using bovine serum albumin (BSA). This choice takes into account the fact that among all the proteins present in human plasma, albumin is the most abundant one and is vital for the maintenance of plasma colloidal osmotic pressure and transport of certain drugs and nutrients. 12 ][15] The use of semiconductor NPs in biomedical applications has been actively explored in the last period, especially due to the potential utilization of NPs in controlled drug delivery and better imaging systems. Nevertheless, the knowledge about the interaction of NPs at biomolecular level is still rather limited and the subject requires deeper investigations. \n\nThe ability to remotely control the physical, chemical, or biological properties of some nanomaterials (NMs) using electromagnetic fields opens the way to the development of novel applications in nanomedicine.",

            "text": "The protein corona-nanoparticle conjunction has raised the interest of many groups regarding not only liposomes but other organic (nanorods, carbon nanotubes) or inorganic particles (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanobones) [36][37][38][39]. However, even if the protein corona can be understood as a problem in nanoparticle uses for biomedical applications, one can take profit of this apparent drawback and turn what is a problem into a new strategy for developing formulations for a specific purpose [35,[40][41][42]. Recently, new molecular targets have been described from identification of the type of proteins that form the corona [43]. In the same trend, fluids enriched with hard corona proteins favored the faster release of the payload compared to those bearing soft coronas [36]. This new approach, attractive in view to the development of personalized medicine, requires a good knowledge of the nature of the proteins that form the corona and of the mechanism of protein-nanoparticle interaction [44,45]. \n\nConsidering the aforementioned, and due to the insufficient knowledge about the interaction of liposomes with the biological environment-which make difficult any prediction of the biological outcomes-we present a study of the behavior of LUVs and hybrid LUVs containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), named magnetoliposomes (MLs), in presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA binds to nanoparticles and changes their physicochemical properties. The BSA-nanoparticles complex has enhanced penetration capability in the biological membrane over bare nanoparticles. To analyze the influence of surface composition on the interaction, these systems were decorated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or the cyclic peptide RGD. Therefore, we report the results obtained with three types of LUVs or MLs: pristine, PEGylated, and RGD functionalized.",

            "text": "In fact, the accumulation of nanomedicines in by the RES organs (namely the liver) remains as a major hurdle to their clinical translation, since the RE cells retain the majority of the injected dose (decreasing the bioavailability of the injected nanoparticles), thereby increasing the associated immunogenicity and toxicity [17,47]. A possible strategy to overcome this problem is to promote the temporary blocking of the RE cells, increasing drug delivery efficiency to the disease sites by rerouting the nanoparticles from the RE organs without the need for special ligands [48][49][50][51]. \n\nSurface chemistry comprises a rather complex set of processes that includes, namely, surface charge, porosity, defects, and chemical group alterations. Numerous system features, such as surface interactions, degradation and agglomeration rates, and cellular uptake, are influenced by surface chemistry. Some studies imply, for instance, that a positively charged surface raises the chances of cellular uptake [43,52]. However, different types of cancer or different stages of the same cancer type can require different surface properties [40], as shown in Figure 5. \n\nIn biological environments, the surface of a nanoparticle is rapidly coated with a layer of biomolecules, which due to its high protein content is commonly known as \"protein corona\" (PC) [53][54][55][56]. The characteristics of PC (such as molecular properties and composition) play a key role in governing the cellular uptake, biocompatibility, distribution, and circulation lifetime of nanoparticles [54,57]. Two of the major factors influencing protein adsorption are the structural stability of proteins (namely their conformational changes) and the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of the surface of nanoparticles. With the dynamic behavior of proteins in physiological media, the layers of PC could be divided into hard corona (inner layer, with tightly bound proteins) and soft corona (weakly bound proteins, rapidly exchanged with free proteins from the media), as illustrated in Figure 6 [58].",

            "text": "Instead, the nanoparticles adopt the physiochemical properties of the adsorbed protein shell: a ''protein corona'' as demonstrated in Fig. 3 (Cedervall et al. 2007;Lynch et al. 2007;Lynch and Dawson 2008). \n\nIn the context of studying the nanoparticlegrowth media interaction, in our own work we found that proteins from the growth media adsorb within 5 min to the surfaces of both cationic and anionic gold nanorods, and increase their hydrodynamic radius. More interestingly, protein adsorption to the surface of the nanorods flips their charge immediately to similar negative value of the serum proteins in the original media (Fig. 3) (Alkilany et al. 2009). Therefore, nanoparticles that had a positive effective surface charge upon preparation are no longer cationic in the cellular media. This is important when considering the molecular effect of charge on toxicity and cellular uptake, and argues against the simple picture, still propagated in the literature, that cationic nanoparticles disrupt the negatively charged cellular membrane by electrostatic interactions. \n\nProtein adsorption to the nanoparticle surface can mediate the uptake of the nanomaterial via receptormediated endocytosis (Conner and Schmid 2003). Therefore, different media with different protein compositions could result in different toxicity and uptake results. This is important when comparing results from different reports addressing the toxicity and uptake of nanoparticles using different methodologies. \n\nIn a similar scenario, we expect that the nanoparticle properties will change when injected into blood Fig. 2 Schematic showing the physical events that occur as a result of satisfying the localized surface plasmon resonance condition, with the corresponding applications. See text for details for in vivo animal studies. Blood contains proteins and electrolytes that can change the effective surface charge of the nanoparticles and their aggregation state. For example, it was shown that positively charged gold nanorods aggregated upon mixing with mouse blood for 4 h.",

            "text": "Since the beginning of the twentieth century [1], manufactured gold nanoparticles (GNP) have been constantly developed for biomedical applications, be it for diagnosis or therapy [2][3][4][5]. The enthusiasm aroused by their unique properties, among which spectroscopic and catalytic, and the possible progress they could generate, lead some to talk about a new \"Golden Age\" [4]. With years, the design of nanoparticles (NP) is complexifying, allowing multiple functionalities on the same object [6][7][8]. Such sophistication is not achievable with small organic molecules or metallic salts, which accounts for the impetus to consider NP as theragnostic platforms. However, once in a biological environment, NP are submitted to new interactions and constraints that could affect their performance (enzymatic digestion, mechanical stress due to rapid blood flow, corrosion, ligand exchange\u2026). In particular, NP are expected to interact with biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and even metabolites, in large extent because of their large surface-to-mass ratio. In fact, the awareness that the synthetic identity of NP could greatly differ from their biological identity is now spreading.\n\nBecause of proteins omnipresence in biological fluids and the increased number of highly sensitive analytical techniques, there has been a growing number of papers dealing with the formation of a protein corona at the surface of NP [9][10][11][12]. Usually, one distinguishes two components in this dynamic process: the soft and the hard coronas. Soft and hard coronas can be defined by their relative affinity for NP surface and exchange times. Hard corona is made by a protein fraction strongly bound to the surface while soft corona is formed by loosely-bound proteins, maybe via protein-protein interaction [10]. The protein corona can thus be multi-layered. NP surface may then get modified and the corona may substantially influence the biological response.\n\nIn this review, we will focus mainly on gold nanoparticles (GNP). In a first part, corona characterization will be summarized. We will attempt to draw the main findings regarding what happens to GNP in a biological fluid in terms of size, charge, aggregation state and corona composition.",

            "text": "[3] Nanoparticles (NPs) are prone to interact with proteins like fibrinogen (FIB), a major class of plasma protein that is essential for blood coagulation, when applied in physiological fluids (e.g., bloodstream or plasma), leading to the immediate formation of a protein layer on the particle surfaces (i.e., protein corona). [4,5] It is believed that the conformation and adsorption kinetics of protein corona are predominantly dependent on the surface properties of NPs (i.e., the surface charge, wettability, targeting groups, etc.). [6,7] The protein corona formation alters the biological identity of NPs, helping them to escape from the immune system and subsequently prolong their circulating lifetime in vivo. [8,9] owever, the protein adsorption would also gravely change the physicochemical properties of bioengineered NPs and remarkably reduce the targeting efficiency. [10] Worse still, the coronated NPs would form clusters or aggregates via non-specific protein-protein attractions, thus impairing the therapeutic efficacy. 13][14] It has been revealed that the NP-protein interaction may not obey the equilibrium adsorption mechanism, prompting us to reconsider the microscopic origins of the time evolution (or aging phenomena) for NP-protein interaction and protein-induced NPs aggregation. [15,16] [23] Nevertheless, limited studies have revealed how the two-timescale behavior is regulated by the distinct types of interactions. Besides, the number of surface-bound proteins may not monotonically increase with time. It has been reported that the soft corona can be completely removed from the surface of polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) in the presence of abundant plasma proteins. [16] Hence, the protein-to-NP ratio determines the composition of reversible and irreversible binding layers. On the other hand, NP-protein aggregation is inversely dependent on the protein-to-NP ratio, that fewer proteins result in larger aggregates. [24,25] Such aggregates with varied sizes and protein-corona constitutes shall exhibit rich structural relaxation dynamics and aging behaviors at multiple lengths and time scales.",

Herein, the physicochemical properties of AgNPs were manipulated by forming biomolecular corona derived from bovine serum albumin (AC), and three organisms at various trophic levels: Chlorella sp. (BC1), Daphnia magna (BC2), and zebrafish (BC3). Proteins were identified by chemical composition analysis as the dominant components adsorbed on the surface of AgNPs.

Consequently, AC and BC3 displayed stronger adsorption affinity on the surface of AgNPs than BC1 and BC2. Modifications by AC and BC3 effectively alleviated the oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest of AgNPs due to their superior antioxidative ability. However, BC3 with lower hydrophobicity enabled AgNPs to be more biocompatible than AC at subcellular level. Moreover, AC could significantly improve the loading capacity of AgNPs by Chlorella through enhancing caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Notably, owing to the adsorption of abundant Ca2+-binding proteins, BC3-AgNPs could also be internalized by microalgae via Ca2+-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which makes it a promising approach to deliver AgNPs. The results of this study would provide insights into the development of an efficient strategy to deliver AgNPs based on the microalgae carrier without altering its original properties and functionality.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, the impasse in effective clinical translation of engineered nanomaterials triggered an unprecedented effort in understanding the biological responses to synthetic nanoparticles (SNPs), which is still underway. The main result of such an effort is the concept of biomolecular corona (BC), that captures the key role played by the complex dynamic interaction occurring between the surface of SNPs immersed in a biological fluid and the biomolecules (proteins, lipids, metabolites, and nucleic acids) populating that fluid, in determining the SNP biological identity and physiological fate [1,2]. The BC changes the physicochemical features of the SNPs, such as surface energy, surface charge, hydrodynamic radius, and aggregation/stability properties. On the flip side, SNPs can induce structural and conformational changes of the proteins confined in the BC. It has been observed that fast diffusive proteins initially adsorb on SNP surface, gradually replaced by slower diffusive ones bearing higher affinity for SNP surface (the so-called Vroman effect). Following this mechanism, the widely accepted hypothesis of BC formation depicts a stable inner layer of biomolecules irreversibly physiosorbed onto the SNP surface (the \u2018hard corona\u2019) interfacing an outer layer of loosely bound molecules, which dynamically exchanges with the medium (the \u2018soft corona\u2019) [2]. Sticking to \u2018mere\u2019 BC composition, irrefutable evidence points to the fact that the BC may enrich (concentrate) specific biomolecules or outline-specific biomolecular patterns hidden in the biological fluid [1,3,4]. This striking feature makes the BC extraordinarily appealing for diagnostics, opening the possibility to single out low abundant biomarkers, which would be otherwise missed, especially in complex biofluids (e.g. blood) and to follow their evolution over time and space. In view of this, explorative studies, which started appearing from 2014, have leveraged the scavenging features of BC to search for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers: thus, unique BC fingerprints could be related to specific diseases [5,6]. For example, different hydrophobic and hydrophilic SNPs have been incubated with plasma of patients with different diseases (i.e. breast cancer, thalassemia, diabetes) or conditions (i.e. pregnancy, smoke, hypercholesterolemia), revealing alteration of the BC (namely, of the hard corona) composition in respect to healthy samples. Notably, the BC resulted also sensitive to individual heterogeneity, unspecified disorders, and gene\u2013gene interactions (i.e. \u2018personalized\u2019 corona [7]). Others have used BC arrays to identify cancer at various stages. Moreover, BC is also influenced by the metabolite composition of the biofluid. Molecular dynamics studies, later corroborated by in vitro studies, have demonstrated that glucose and cholesterol, respectively, model metabolites of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, could substantially affect the interaction, the amount, and the conformation of fibrinogen protein in the BC of NPs [6]. Most of the studies have so far focused on BC proteomics, even though the analysis of protein post-translational modifications, or the analysis of biomolecules, which may also constitute the BC, such as metabolites and nucleic acids, is gaining considerable interest [4]. Despite the exciting promises, the full potentiality of BC of SNPs for diagnostic studies still remains hindered by important drawbacks, mainly ascribable to the experimental hurdles in (i) design and synthesis of nontoxic SNPs capable of collecting a \u2018biomarker BC\u2019 as well as in (ii) high-throughput BC separation and characterization [8].",

To be able to separate the chitosan\u2010based nanoparticles from the blood plasma, magnetic nanoparticles were coated with chitosan (with a positive charge) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC; with a negative charge) in two different size ranges of 200\u2013250 and 300\u2013350\u2009nm. The coated nanoparticles' chemical composition, properties, and morphology were investigated using Fourier\u2010transform infrared spectroscopy, X\u2010ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential measurements, transmission electron microscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscope. The results confirmed the formation of nanoparticles based on chitosan and CMC. Subsequently, these nanoparticles were exposed to blood plasma to examine the protein corona that formed. The DLS and zeta potential measurements showed that the surface charge and particle size of the nanoparticles significantly influenced the formation of the protein corona. The results revealed that the smaller particle size and the positive surface charge of the nanoparticles resulted in the formation of a thicker corona.

To overcome this major hurdle, we have synthesized a set of TMZ-encapsulating nanomedicines made of four cationic liposome (CL) formulations with systematic changes in lipid composition and physical-chemical properties. The targeting nature of this nanomedicine is provided by the recruitment of proteins, with natural targeting capacity, in the biomolecular corona (BC) layer that forms around CLs after exposure to human plasma (HP). TMZ-loaded CL-BC complexes were thoroughly characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), and nanoliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC MS/MS). BCs were found to be enriched of typical BC fingerprints (BCFs) (e.g., Apolipoproteins, Vitronectin, and vitamin K-dependent protein), which have a substantial capacity in binding to receptors that are overexpressed at the BBB (e.g., scavenger receptor class B, type I and low-density lipoprotein receptor). We found that the CL formulation exhibiting the highest levels of targeting BCFs had larger uptake in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that are commonly used as an in vitro model of the BBB. This formulation could also deliver TMZ to the human glioblastoma U-87 MG cell line and thus substantially enhance their antitumor efficacy compared to corona free CLs.

Recent studies have shown that precoating nanoparticles with serum proteins can improve the biocompatibility and stealth properties of nanoparticles. However, it is not fully clear how precoating influences biomolecular corona formation and downstream biological responses. Herein, we systematically examine three precoating strategies by coating bovine serum albumin (single protein), fetal bovine serum (FBS, mixed proteins without immunoglobulins), or bovine serum (mixed proteins) on three nanoparticle systems, namely supramolecular template nanoparticles, metal-phenolic network (MPN)-coated template (core-shell) nanoparticles, and MPN nanocapsules (obtained after template removal). The effect of protein precoating on biomolecular corona compositions and particle-immune cell interactions in human blood was characterized. In the absence of a pre-coating, the MPN nanocapsules displayed lower leukocyte association, which correlated to the lower amount (by 2-3 fold) of adsorbed proteins and substantially fewer immunoglobulins (more than 100 times) in the biomolecular corona relative to the template and core-shell nanoparticles. Among the three coating strategies, FBS precoating demonstrated the most significant reduction in leukocyte association (up to 97% of all three nanoparticles). A correlation analysis highlights that immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins may regulate leukocyte recognition. This study demonstrates the impact of different precoating strategies on nanoparticle-immune cell association and the role of immunoglobulins in bio-nano interactions.",

This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of NLSs with varying lipid compositions to understand their physicochemical and mechanical properties, which are crucial for their performance in biomedical applications. NLSs were prepared using a solvent displacement method, resulting in formulations with different ratios of olive oil and stearic acid. These formulations were characterized to determine their size, polydispersity index, and surface charge. Dynamic Light Scattering and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis revealed that the size of the NLSs increased with higher stearic acid content. The NLSs demonstrated stability across a range of pH levels and in cell culture medium. The biomolecular corona formation and its impact on surface charge were also evaluated, showing significant effects on NLS stability. Mechanical properties, including rigidity and deformability, were assessed using Atomic Force Microscopy and rheological tests. The study found that increasing stearic acid content enhanced NLS rigidity and adhesion strength, which is crucial for their behaviour in biological systems such as blood circulation, tumor targeting, and cellular uptake. Biological evaluations demonstrated that these mechanical properties significantly influenced bio-interactions. Softer NLSs with a pure olive oil core displayed enhanced translocation across an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, underscoring their potential for drug delivery to the brain. Conversely, glioblastoma cell uptake studies revealed that the more rigid NLSs were internalized more efficiently by U87-MG cells, suggesting a role for stiffness in cellular entry. These findings provide insights into optimizing NLSs for specific therapeutic applications, particularly in overcoming barriers like the blood-brain barrier and targeting cerebral diseases.",

The present review will address updates of the protein bio-corona characteristics as influenced by nanoparticle\u2019s physicochemical properties and by the particularities of the encountered biological milieu. Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons."

The liposome\u2013protein corona is a dynamic interface that regulates the interaction of liposomes with the physiological environment. Here we show that the biological identity of liposomes is clearly linked to their sequestration from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors that ultimately leads to removal from the bloodstream. Pre-coating liposomes with an artificial corona made of human plasma proteins drastically reduces capture by circulating leukocytes in whole blood and may be an effective strategy to enable prolonged circulation in vivo. We conclude with a critical assessment of the key concepts of liposome technology that need to be reviewed for its definitive clinical translation. Protein corona formation is known to have significant effects upon nanomaterials application. Here, the authors investigate the creation of a protein coating on liposomes with the aim of improving liposome circulation time by avoiding leukocyte capture and demonstrated application in vitro and ex vivo."

In particular, absorbance, fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy measurements were performed on surface-functionalized water-soluble gold NPs having a diameter range from 5 to 100 nm in the presence of common human blood proteins: albumin, fibrinogen, gamma-globulin, histone, and insulin. We find that the gold NPs strongly associate with these essential blood proteins where the binding constant, K, as well as the degree of cooperativity of particle--protein binding (Hill constant, n), depends on particle size and the native protein structure. We also find tentative evidence that the model proteins undergo conformational change upon association with the NPs and that the thickness of the adsorbed protein layer (bare NP diameter <50 nm) progressively increases with NP size, effects that have potential general importance for understanding NP aggregation in biological media and the interaction of NP with biological materials broadly."

Liposomes composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-3000] (DPPE-PEG 3000), cholesterol (CH) or mixtures of these lipids, were prepared at different concentrations by the thin-film hydration method. After liposomes were dispersed in HPLC-grade water and foetal bovine serum (FBS), their physicochemical characteristics, such as size, size distribution, and \u03b6-potential, were determined using dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. Aggregation of DPPC, HSPC, DPPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio), and HSPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio) in FBS was observed. On the contrary, liposomes incorporating DPPG lipids and CH both in a molar ratio of 11% were found to be stable over time, while their size did not alter dramatically in biological medium. Liposomes containing CH and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. In addition, our results indicate that the protein binding depends on the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), CH, concentration and surface charge. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter, fraction of stealthiness (Fs), for investigating the extent of protein binding to liposomes. This parameter depends on the changes in size of liposomes after serum incubation, while liposomes have stealth properties when Fs is close to 1. Thus, we conclude that lipid composition and concentration affect the adsorption of proteins and the liposomal stabilization."

This study examines the influence of protein coronas on the targeting ability of layer-by-layer (LbL)-assembled polymer capsules and core-shell particles functionalized with monoclonal antibodies. Upon exposure of humanized A33 monoclonal antibody (huA33 mAb)-functionalized poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) capsules or huA33 mAb-PMA particles to human serum, a total of 83 or 65 proteins were identified in the protein coronas, respectively. Human serum of varying concentrations altered the composition of the protein corona. The antibody-driven specific cell membrane binding was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy in both the absence and presence of a protein corona. The findings show that although different protein coronas formed in human serum (at different concentrations), the targeting ability of both the huA33 mAb-functionalized PMA capsules and particles toward human colon cancer cells was retained, demonstrating no significant difference compared with capsules and particles in the absence of protein coronas: \u223c70% and \u223c90% A33-expressing cells were targeted by the huA33 mAb-PMA capsules and particles, respectively, in a mixed cell population. This result demonstrates that the formation of protein coronas did not significantly influence the targeting ability of antibody-functionalized LbL-polymer carriers, indicating that the surface functionality of engineered particles in the presence of protein coronas can be preserved.",

However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references).",

Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

Model surfaces of tailored nanotopography of heights of 16, 38, and 68 nm are created by covalent immobilization of gold nanoparticles to an oxazoline\u2010rich plasma polymer film. This strategy not only produces surfaces of tailored nanofeature density but allows control of the outermost surface chemistry. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and Mac\u20101 positive THP\u20101 monocytes studies demonstrate distinct protein unfolding patterns, which upregulate or downregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cells attachment.

This study investigated the role of surface chemistry and wettability on human serum-derived protein corona formation on biomaterial surfaces, and the subsequent effects on cellular innate immune response. Plasma polymerization, a substrate independent technique, was employed to create nano-thin coatings with four specific chemical functionalities, and a spectrum of surface charges and wettability. The amount and type of protein adsorbed was strongly influenced by surface chemistry and wettability, but did not show any dependence on surface charge. An enhanced adsorption of the dysopsonin albumin was observed on hydrophilic carboxyl surfaces while high opsonin IgG2 adsorption was seen on hydrophobic hydrocarbon surfaces. This in turn led to distinct immune response from macrophages; hydrophilic surfaces drove greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, whilst surface hydrophobicity caused increased production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. These findings map out a unique relationship between surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, protein corona formation and subsequent cellular innate immune responses; the potential outcomes of these studies may be employed to tailor biomaterial surface modifications, to modulate serum protein adsorption and to achieve desirable innate immune response to implanted biomaterials and devices.",

Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al.

Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM.",

Therefore, the aim of this work was to further advance the LNP platform through the development of novel, next-generation lipids that combine the excellent potency of the most advanced lipids currently available with biodegradable functionality. As a representative example of this novel class of biodegradable lipids, the lipid evaluated in this work displays rapid elimination from plasma and tissues, substantially improved tolerability in preclinical studies, while maintaining in vivo potency on par with that of the most advanced lipids currently available."

Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. (80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81)."

Corona-mediated targeting provides a new impetus for specific drug delivery by precisely manipulating interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on nano-surface. Here bio-inspired liposomes (SP-sLip) were developed by modifying liposomal surface with a short nontoxic peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of exchangeable apolipoproteins. SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes.

Furthermore, nanovaccines can be decorated on their surface with molecules that facilitate target-specific antigen delivery to certain antigen-presenting cell types or tumor cells. However, the target cell-specific uptake of nanovaccines is highly dependent on the modifications of the nanocarrier itself. One of these is the formation of a protein corona around NC after in vivo administration, which may potently affect cell-specific targeting and uptake of the NC. Understanding the formation and composition of the protein corona is, therefore, of major importance for the use of nanocarriers in vaccine approaches.

PEG was covalently linked to the polymer surface to the maximal grafting density achievable under our experimental conditions. Changes in the effective hydrodynamic radius of the NPs upon adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured in situ using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. For NPs without a PEG shell, a thickness increase of around 3 nm, corresponding to HSA monolayer adsorption, was measured at high HSA concentration. Only 50% of this value was found for NPs with PEGylated surfaces. While the size increase clearly reveals formation of a protein corona also for PEGylated NPs, fluorescence lifetime measurements and quenching experiments suggest that the adsorbed HSA molecules are buried within the PEG shell. For FIB adsorption onto PEGylated NPs, even less change in NP diameter was observed. In vitro uptake of the NPs by 3T3 fibroblasts was reduced to around 10% upon PEGylation with PEG chains of 10 kDa. Thus, even though the PEG coatings did not completely prevent protein adsorption, the PEGylated NPs still displayed a pronounced reduction of cellular uptake with respect to bare NPs, which is to be expected if the adsorbed proteins are not exposed on the NP surface."

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.",

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

Here, polymersomes are self-assembled via film rehydration, solvent exchange, and polymerization-induced self-assembly using five different block copolymers. The hydrophilic blocks are composed of anti-fouling polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMOXA), and all the data is benchmarked to PEGylated \u201cstealth\u201d liposomes. High colloidal stability in human plasma (HP) is confirmed for all but two tested nanovesicles. In situ fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements are then performed after incubating unlabeled nanovesicles with fluorescently labeled HP or the specific labeled plasma proteins, human serum albumin, and clusterin (apolipoprotein J). The binding of HP to PMOXA-polymersomes could explain their relatively short circulation times found previously. In contrast, PEGylated liposomes also interact with HP but accumulate high levels of clusterin, providing them with their known prolonged circulation time. The absence of significant protein binding for most PEG-polymersomes indicates mechanistic differences in protein interactions and associated downstream effects, such as cell uptake and circulation time, compared to PEGylated liposomes.

Unfortunately, the processes occurring at the interface between nanomaterials and living systems are exceedingly complex and not yet well understood, which has significantly hampered the realization of many nanobiotechnology applications. Whenever nanoparticles (NPs) are incorporated by a living organism, a protein adsorption layer, also known as the \"protein corona\", forms on the NP surface. Accordingly, living organisms interact with protein-coated rather than bare NPs, and their biological responses depend on the nature of the protein corona. In recent years, a wide variety of biophysical techniques have been employed to elucidate mechanistic aspects of NP-protein interactions. In most studies, NPs are immersed in protein or biofluid (e.g., blood serum) solutions and then separated from the liquid for analysis. Because this approach may modify the composition and structure of the protein corona, our group has pioneered the use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) as an in situ technique, capable of examining NP-protein interactions while the NPs are suspended in biological fluids. FCS allows us to measure, with subnanometer precision and as a function of protein concentration, the increase in hydrodynamic radius of the NPs due to protein adsorption. This Account aims at reviewing recent progress in the exploration of NP-protein interactions by using FCS. In vitro FCS studies of the adsorption of important serum proteins onto water-solubilized luminescent NPs always showed a stepwise increase of the NP radius upon protein binding in the form of a binding isotherm, regardless of the type of NP and its specific surface functionalization. This observation indicates formation of a protein monolayer on the NP. Structure-based calculations of protein surface potentials revealed that positively charged patches on the proteins interact electrostatically with negatively charged NP surfaces, and the observed protein layer thickness always matched the known molecular dimensions of the proteins binding in certain orientations. Temperature and NP surface functionalization have also been identified as important parameters controlling protein corona formation. Notably, while the corona formed from a single type of serum protein was reversible, protein adsorption from complex biological media such as blood serum was entirely irreversible. These quantitative in vitro studies are of great relevance to the bio-nano community and especially to researchers developing engineered nanomaterials for biological and biomedical applications. Future efforts will be directed toward elucidating kinetic aspects of protein corona formation and the detailed structure of the adsorbed proteins at the molecular level. To better appreciate the biological responses triggered by NP exposure, more efforts will be devoted to the exploration of the biomolecular corona as it forms on NPs in contact with living cells, tissues, and even entire model organisms. These studies are challenging when performed in a well-controlled and quantitative fashion and rely on the availability of sophisticated analytical tools, particularly, quantitative optical imaging techniques including FCS and related fluctuation methods."

Understanding the true nature of the biomolecular corona (BC) in its native state is, therefore, essential for its safe and efficient application in clinical settings. The fundamental challenge is to visualize the biomolecules within the corona and their relationship/association to the surface of the NPs. Using a synergistic application of cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and three-dimensional reconstruction, we revealed the unique morphological details of the biomolecules and their distribution/association with the surface of polystyrene NPs at a nanoscale resolution. The analysis of the BC at a single NP level and its variability among NPs in the same sample, and the discovery of the presence of nonspecific biomolecules in plasma residues, enable more precise characterization of NPs, improving predictions of their safety and efficacies. Understanding the biomolecular corona is of key importance to nanomedicine.

Protein corona identity and abundance characterization is entirely dependent on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), though the variability of this technique for the purpose of protein corona characterization remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the variability of LC-MS/MS workflows in analysis of identical aliquots of protein coronas by sending them to different proteomics core-facilities and analyzing the retrieved datasets. While the shared data between the cores correlate well, there is considerable heterogeneity in the data retrieved from different cores. Specifically, out of 4022 identified unique proteins, only 73 (1.8%) are shared across the core facilities providing semiquantitative analysis. These findings suggest that protein corona datasets cannot be easily compared across independent studies and more broadly compromise the interpretation of protein corona research, with implications in biomarker discovery as well as the safety and efficacy of our nanoscale biotechnologies. Analysis of the protein corona formed around nanoparticles is important for multiple applications in nanomedicine, the methods used at core facilities used for analysis can impact the results. Here, the authors report on a study into the variability of the results obtained from 17 different core facilities and the implications of this."

Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of systemically administered anti-VEGF antibodies are often hindered in NSCLCs because of their limited distribution in the lungs and their adverse effects on normal tissues. These challenges can be overcome by delivering therapeutic antibodies in their mRNA form to lung endothelial cells, a primary target of VEGF-mediated pulmonary angiogenesis, to suppress the NSCLCs. In this study, we synthesized derivatives of poly(\u03b2-amino esters) (PBAEs) and prepared nanoparticles to encapsulate the synthetic mRNA encoding bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody used in the clinic. Optimization of nanoparticle formulations resulted in a selective lung transfection after intravenous administration. Notably, the optimized PBAE nanoparticles were distributed in lung endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of bevacizumab. We analyzed the protein corona on the lung- and spleen-targeting nanoparticles using proteomics and found distinctive features potentially contributing to their organ-selectivity. Lastly, bevacizumab mRNA delivered by the lung-targeting PBAE nanoparticles more significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis than recombinant bevacizumab protein in orthotopic NSCLC mouse models, supporting the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab mRNA therapy and its selective delivery through lung-targeting nanoparticles. Our proof-of-principle results highlight the clinical benefits of nanoparticle-mediated mRNA therapy in anticancer antibody treatment in preclinical models."

                "snippets": "After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics (Foroozandeh et al., 2015)(Caracciolo et al., 2017). At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017). Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time (Gao et al., 2014). The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug (Gunawan et al., 2014)(Lazarovits et al., 2015). A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances (Aggarwal et al., 2009)(Suk et al., 2016)(Mogo\u0219anu et al., 2016).",

Typically, less than 10% of all systemically administered nanoparticles accumulate in the tumour. Here we explore the interactions of blood components with nanoparticles and describe how these interactions influence solid tumour targeting. In the blood, serum proteins adsorb onto nanoparticles to form a protein corona in a manner dependent on nanoparticle physicochemical properties. These serum proteins can block nanoparticle tumour targeting ligands from binding to tumour cell receptors. Additionally, serum proteins can also encourage nanoparticle uptake by macrophages, which decreases nanoparticle availability in the blood and limits tumour accumulation. The formation of this protein corona will also increase the nanoparticle hydrodynamic size or induce aggregation, which makes nanoparticles too large to enter into the tumour through pores of the leaky vessels, and prevents their deep penetration into tumours for cell targeting. Recent studies have focused on developing new chemical strategies to reduce or eliminate serum protein adsorption, and rescue the targeting potential of nanoparticles to tumour cells. An in-depth and complete understanding of nanoparticle-blood interactions is key to designing nanoparticles with optimal physicochemical properties with high tumour accumulation. The purpose of this review article is to describe how the protein corona alters the targeting of nanoparticles to solid tumours and explains current solutions to solve this problem.",

The biological effects arising from the presence of protein corona can be both beneficial and unfavourable to the biomedical applications of nanoparticles. The protein corona-cell interactions open up the feasibility of targeted delivery and cell-specific uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles and in other circumstances, engineering of nanoparticles as adjuvants for vaccine development as well as mitigation of the unintentional cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles.

The main aim of this review is to present different factors that are influencing protein-nanoparticle interaction such as physicochemical properties of nanoparticle (i.e., size and size distribution, shape, composition, surface chemistry, and coatings) and the effect of biological microenvironments. Apart from that, the effect of ignored factors at the bio-nano interface such as temperature, plasma concentration, plasma gradient effect, administration route, and cell observer were also addressed."

                        "quote": "After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics (Foroozandeh et al., 2015)(Caracciolo et al., 2017). At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017). Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time (Gao et al., 2014). The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug (Gunawan et al., 2014)(Lazarovits et al., 2015). A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances (Aggarwal et al., 2009)(Suk et al., 2016)(Mogo\u0219anu et al., 2016)."

This corona formation is influenced by the nanoparticle's physicochemical properties and plays a crucial role in determining the nanoparticle's fate, distribution, and biological effects.

                "text": "\nWhen lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are introduced into biological environments such as blood, their surfaces are immediately covered with a layer of biomolecules, predominantly proteins, forming what is known as the biomolecular or protein corona <Paper corpusId=\"145022637\" paperTitle=\"(Halamoda-Kenzaoui et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This phenomenon is now widely recognized and has been documented across various nanomaterials, including lipid-, metal-, polymer-, and carbon-based nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"221359571\" paperTitle=\"(Gardner et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe formation of the protein corona fundamentally alters the synthetic characteristics of nanoparticles, endowing them with a distinct biological identity that differs from their original engineered properties <Paper corpusId=\"191210206\" paperTitle=\"(Digiacomo et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"23552682\" paperTitle=\"(Walkey et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This biological identity, rather than the synthetic one, is what cells and tissues actually encounter and respond to in vivo <Paper corpusId=\"31975084\" paperTitle=\"(Walkey et al._1, 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona is not static but dynamic in nature, with proteins continuously undergoing desorption and adsorption processes on the nanoparticle surface. This dynamic exchange, known as the Vroman effect, changes the corona composition over time while maintaining a relatively constant overall protein quantity <Paper corpusId=\"244811268\" paperTitle=\"(Ribovski et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe composition of the protein corona is highly dependent on both the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (such as size, surface chemistry, and coating) and the specific biological environment they encounter <Paper corpusId=\"232122639\" paperTitle=\"(Imperlini et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207728390\" paperTitle=\"(Dai et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. For LNPs specifically, surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a critical role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona can significantly impact the biological fate and function of LNPs. It can influence their biodistribution by governing organ-specific accumulation through proteins like ApoE (liver) and complement system-related proteins (spleen) <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the corona may impede targeted delivery by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, even minor modifications in LNP composition can dramatically alter the protein corona pattern. For example, research has shown that substituting cholesterol with the cationic lipid DC-cholesterol shifts the protein corona from being apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich, which subsequently affects cell transfection efficiency and tumor-specific delivery <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203153060\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nUnderstanding the formation and composition of the protein corona is essential for predicting the biological interactions, efficacy, and potential toxicity of LNPs in therapeutic applications <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Upon introduction to a complex biological system, nanomaterials dynamically interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein \"bio-corona.\" The decoration with these surface biomolecules endows nanoparticles with new properties. The present review will address updates of the protein bio-corona characteristics as influenced by nanoparticle\u2019s physicochemical properties and by the particularities of the encountered biological milieu. Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons."

                            "Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

                            "Engineered particles adsorb biomolecules (e.g., proteins) when introduced in a biological medium to form a layer called a \"corona\". Coronas, in particular the protein corona, play an important role in determining the surface properties of particles and their targeting abilities. This study examines the influence of protein coronas on the targeting ability of layer-by-layer (LbL)-assembled polymer capsules and core-shell particles functionalized with monoclonal antibodies. Upon exposure of humanized A33 monoclonal antibody (huA33 mAb)-functionalized poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) capsules or huA33 mAb-PMA particles to human serum, a total of 83 or 65 proteins were identified in the protein coronas, respectively. Human serum of varying concentrations altered the composition of the protein corona. The antibody-driven specific cell membrane binding was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy in both the absence and presence of a protein corona. The findings show that although different protein coronas formed in human serum (at different concentrations), the targeting ability of both the huA33 mAb-functionalized PMA capsules and particles toward human colon cancer cells was retained, demonstrating no significant difference compared with capsules and particles in the absence of protein coronas: \u223c70% and \u223c90% A33-expressing cells were targeted by the huA33 mAb-PMA capsules and particles, respectively, in a mixed cell population. This result demonstrates that the formation of protein coronas did not significantly influence the targeting ability of antibody-functionalized LbL-polymer carriers, indicating that the surface functionality of engineered particles in the presence of protein coronas can be preserved."

(Chen et al., 2019) investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

                            "The application of lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems remains a popular strategy for the systemic delivery of gene therapies to specific disease targets, including solid tumors. It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

                            "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160](Dai et al., 2015)(Walkey et al., 2012)(Walkey et al., 2012). Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same (Walkey et al., 2012)(Vroman, 1962)",

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

In particular, absorbance, fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy measurements were performed on surface-functionalized water-soluble gold NPs having a diameter range from 5 to 100 nm in the presence of common human blood proteins: albumin, fibrinogen, gamma-globulin, histone, and insulin. We find that the gold NPs strongly associate with these essential blood proteins where the binding constant, K, as well as the degree of cooperativity of particle--protein binding (Hill constant, n), depends on particle size and the native protein structure. We also find tentative evidence that the model proteins undergo conformational change upon association with the NPs and that the thickness of the adsorbed protein layer (bare NP diameter <50 nm) progressively increases with NP size, effects that have potential general importance for understanding NP aggregation in biological media and the interaction of NP with biological materials broadly."

                            "The biological identity of nanoparticles (NPs) is established by their interactions with a wide range of biomolecules around their surfaces after exposure to biological media. Understanding the true nature of the biomolecular corona (BC) in its native state is, therefore, essential for its safe and efficient application in clinical settings. The fundamental challenge is to visualize the biomolecules within the corona and their relationship/association to the surface of the NPs. Using a synergistic application of cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and three-dimensional reconstruction, we revealed the unique morphological details of the biomolecules and their distribution/association with the surface of polystyrene NPs at a nanoscale resolution. The analysis of the BC at a single NP level and its variability among NPs in the same sample, and the discovery of the presence of nonspecific biomolecules in plasma residues, enable more precise characterization of NPs, improving predictions of their safety and efficacies. Understanding the biomolecular corona is of key importance to nanomedicine. Here, the authors report on cryo-electron and tomographic imaging of the corona formed on model nanoparticles and the 3D reconstruction of the corona to study the distribution and association of the biomolecules with the nanoparticle."

                            "Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

The present review will address updates of the protein bio-corona characteristics as influenced by nanoparticle\u2019s physicochemical properties and by the particularities of the encountered biological milieu. Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons."

This variation in protein composition directly impacts cellular interactions and ultimately the therapeutic efficacy of LNPs.\n\nThe specific components in lipid formulations play distinct roles in protein adsorption.

Liposomes composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) or hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-3000] (DPPE-PEG 3000), cholesterol (CH) or mixtures of these lipids, were prepared at different concentrations by the thin-film hydration method. After liposomes were dispersed in HPLC-grade water and foetal bovine serum (FBS), their physicochemical characteristics, such as size, size distribution, and \u03b6-potential, were determined using dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. Aggregation of DPPC, HSPC, DPPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio), and HSPC:CH (9:1 molar ratio) in FBS was observed. On the contrary, liposomes incorporating DPPG lipids and CH both in a molar ratio of 11% were found to be stable over time, while their size did not alter dramatically in biological medium. Liposomes containing CH and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. In addition, our results indicate that the protein binding depends on the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), CH, concentration and surface charge. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter, fraction of stealthiness (Fs), for investigating the extent of protein binding to liposomes. This parameter depends on the changes in size of liposomes after serum incubation, while liposomes have stealth properties when Fs is close to 1.

In another example, compositional variations in lipid-based NPs were shown to significantly change their targeting efficacies to specific organs. [45,46] The complete replacement of a conventional helper lipid with an alternative anionic or cationic lipid was shown to cause a pronounced and consistent shift of lipid NPs biodistribution in vivo from to either the mouse spleen or lung. [47] The proposed mechanism for such a striking shift in NP fate in vivo is that NPs formulated with neutral or anionic helper lipids can be uptaken by epithelial and immune cells to the spleen or lung, respectively. Robust information on the protein corona profiles of these NPs are essential to define the exact mechanism of action for these and other similar NPs. [48]"

Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. (80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81)."

                            "Significance The current application of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based technology has largely been confined to liver diseases because of the lack of a specific and efficient extrahepatic in vivo systemic mRNA delivery system. Here, we have developed a library of N-series lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that could specifically regulate the protein composition of protein corona on the surface of LNPs, which allows specific delivery of mRNA to the lung. We further demonstrated that our lung-targeting LNP could effectively deliver mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA into TSC2-null cells and restore its function, resulting in enhanced control of tumor burden in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Safe and efficacious systemic delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific organs and cells in vivo remains the major challenge in the development of mRNA-based therapeutics. Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM."

                            "In recent years, RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, most notably with lipid nanoparticle-based delivery systems, have advanced into human clinical trials. The results from these early clinical trials suggest that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and the novel ionizable lipids that comprise them, will be important materials in this emerging field of medicine. A persistent theme in the use of materials for biomedical applications has been the incorporation of biodegradability as a means to improve biocompatibility and/or to facilitate elimination. Therefore, the aim of this work was to further advance the LNP platform through the development of novel, next-generation lipids that combine the excellent potency of the most advanced lipids currently available with biodegradable functionality. As a representative example of this novel class of biodegradable lipids, the lipid evaluated in this work displays rapid elimination from plasma and tissues, substantially improved tolerability in preclinical studies, while maintaining in vivo potency on par with that of the most advanced lipids currently available."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively (Dilliard et al., 2021)(Jayaraman et al., 2012)(Xiong et al., 2020)."

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33], which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells."

                            "Therapeutic antibodies that block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) show clinical benefits in treating nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Nonetheless, the therapeutic effects of systemically administered anti-VEGF antibodies are often hindered in NSCLCs because of their limited distribution in the lungs and their adverse effects on normal tissues. These challenges can be overcome by delivering therapeutic antibodies in their mRNA form to lung endothelial cells, a primary target of VEGF-mediated pulmonary angiogenesis, to suppress the NSCLCs. In this study, we synthesized derivatives of poly(\u03b2-amino esters) (PBAEs) and prepared nanoparticles to encapsulate the synthetic mRNA encoding bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody used in the clinic. Optimization of nanoparticle formulations resulted in a selective lung transfection after intravenous administration. Notably, the optimized PBAE nanoparticles were distributed in lung endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of bevacizumab. We analyzed the protein corona on the lung- and spleen-targeting nanoparticles using proteomics and found distinctive features potentially contributing to their organ-selectivity. Lastly, bevacizumab mRNA delivered by the lung-targeting PBAE nanoparticles more significantly inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis than recombinant bevacizumab protein in orthotopic NSCLC mouse models, supporting the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab mRNA therapy and its selective delivery through lung-targeting nanoparticles. Our proof-of-principle results highlight the clinical benefits of nanoparticle-mediated mRNA therapy in anticancer antibody treatment in preclinical models."

Positively charged LNPs attract different protein profiles than neutral or negatively charged ones, with cationic surfaces dramatically shifting corona composition from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich profiles, significantly affecting cellular interactions and therapeutic efficacy. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nSurface charge stands out as one of the most critical physicochemical properties influencing the formation and composition of the protein corona on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) <Paper corpusId=\"239341192\" paperTitle=\"(Akhter et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"260659630\" paperTitle=\"(Mihailova et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. When LNPs enter biological environments, their surface charge significantly determines which specific plasma proteins will adsorb to their surfaces, creating a biological identity that may differ substantially from their synthetic one <Paper corpusId=\"256029453\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that positively charged LNPs exhibit markedly different protein corona profiles compared to their neutral or negatively charged counterparts. While negatively charged nanoparticles show less profound effects on corona formation, the introduction of positively charged lipids can dramatically shift the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich <Paper corpusId=\"239341192\" paperTitle=\"(Akhter et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This charge-dependent alteration in protein composition directly impacts cellular interactions and drug delivery efficiency.\n\nThe relationship between surface charge and protein adsorption is partly explained by electrostatic interactions. It is often suggested that positively charged proteins are attracted to negatively charged surfaces due to complementary electrostatic forces <Paper corpusId=\"247034862\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"5601054\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmoudi et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, protein adsorption on nanoparticles isn't governed by chemistry alone; steric effects due to particle curvature also significantly influence corona composition <Paper corpusId=\"247034862\" paperTitle=\"(Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"197422006\" paperTitle=\"(Visalakshan et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe influence of surface charge on protein corona formation has important practical implications for LNP design and function. For instance, small alterations in surface charge can significantly affect the targeting capabilities of LNPs. Recent research has shown that lung-targeted LNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LNPs (7.81 mV), which correlated with distinct protein corona compositions and ultimately different tissue tropisms <Paper corpusId=\"271795738\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. The lung-targeted nanoparticles demonstrated unique protein profiles with 98 proteins not found on liver-targeted counterparts, while liver-targeted LNPs predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with its role in hepatic-targeting delivery.\n\nSimilarly, studies have shown that introducing positive charge via cationic lipids such as DC-cholesterol (as a substitution for conventional cholesterol) can shift the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich, significantly affecting cell transfection, biodistribution, and tumor-specific delivery efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203153060\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe interaction between charged LNP surfaces and proteins can also influence the structural integrity of the nanoparticles themselves. SAXS experiments have demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by human plasma protein corona depends significantly on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes <Paper corpusId=\"254318207\" paperTitle=\"(Sartori et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This relationship between surface charge, protein adsorption, and nanoparticle stability underscores the importance of charge considerations in LNP design.\n\nSurface modification strategies such as PEGylation can significantly alter the charge-dependent protein interactions with LNPs. Formulations without stealth polymers on their surface tend to have significantly higher plasma protein adsorption compared to PEGylated formulations <Paper corpusId=\"260659630\" paperTitle=\"(Mihailova et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reduced protein adsorption on PEGylated surfaces has important implications for the biological fate of LNPs, including their circulation time and targeting efficiency.\n\nUnderstanding the influence of surface charge on protein corona formation provides valuable insights for designing LNPs with predictable biological identities and tailored therapeutic properties. By manipulating surface charge, researchers can potentially control protein corona composition to enhance targeted delivery, improve circulation times, and reduce undesired biological interactions <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands (Tekie et al., 2020). Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo",

                            "In order to understand how the nanoparticles physico-chemical properties govern the composition of the corona, the adsorbed proteins were sorted by increasing molecular weight (Figures S6 and S7) and increasing isoelectric points (Figures S8 and S9). We observed a distinct enrichment of proteins of small molecular weight (such as Apolipoprotein A-I, HGR and Albumin) on all nanoparticle coronas. In our previous study focused on protein adsorption on planar plasma polymer-coated substrates, one of the top five bound proteins was Apolipoprotein B-100 (MW = 517.0 KDa) (Visalakshan et al., 2019). In contrast, in the present study, the largest protein observed in the top five most abundant proteins adsorbed on PPSiNPs was Albumin, which is only 69.4 KDa in molecular weight. Hence, the present results indicate that protein adsorption on nanoparticles isn't a process governed by chemistry alone, but that steric effects due to the particles curvature also influence the corona composition (Visalakshan et al., 2019). \n\nIt is often suggested that positively charged proteins are attracted to negatively charged surfaces (Mahmoudi et al., 2011). A study on model latex particles functionalized with different chemical groups has shown that negatively charged particles bearing acidic functional groups exhibit a general preference for proteins of isoelectric point greater than 5.5"

This study investigated the role of surface chemistry and wettability on human serum-derived protein corona formation on biomaterial surfaces, and the subsequent effects on cellular innate immune response. Plasma polymerization, a substrate independent technique, was employed to create nano-thin coatings with four specific chemical functionalities, and a spectrum of surface charges and wettability. The amount and type of protein adsorbed was strongly influenced by surface chemistry and wettability, but did not show any dependence on surface charge. An enhanced adsorption of the dysopsonin albumin was observed on hydrophilic carboxyl surfaces while high opsonin IgG2 adsorption was seen on hydrophobic hydrocarbon surfaces. This in turn led to distinct immune response from macrophages; hydrophilic surfaces drove greater expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, whilst surface hydrophobicity caused increased production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. These findings map out a unique relationship between surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, protein corona formation and subsequent cellular innate immune responses; the potential outcomes of these studies may be employed to tailor biomaterial surface modifications, to modulate serum protein adsorption and to achieve desirable innate immune response to implanted biomaterials and devices."

These included an examination of nanoparticles surface charge, size, and protein corona formed in vivo",
                            "However, there was a significant difference exists between the nanoparticle surface charge: lungtargeted LSNPs exhibited a higher positive zeta potential (19.8 mV) compared to liver-targeted LSNPs (7.81 mV). This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25)."

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2019) investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

                            "The application of lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems remains a popular strategy for the systemic delivery of gene therapies to specific disease targets, including solid tumors. It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

We observed a distinct enrichment of proteins of small molecular weight (such as Apolipoprotein A-I, HGR and Albumin) on all nanoparticle coronas. In our previous study focused on protein adsorption on planar plasma polymer-coated substrates, one of the top five bound proteins was Apolipoprotein B-100 (MW = 517.0 KDa) (Visalakshan et al., 2019). In contrast, in the present study, the largest protein observed in the top five most abundant proteins adsorbed on PPSiNPs was Albumin, which is only 69.4 KDa in molecular weight. Hence, the present results indicate that protein adsorption on nanoparticles isn't a process governed by chemistry alone, but that steric effects due to the particles curvature also influence the corona composition (Visalakshan et al., 2019). \n\nIt is often suggested that positively charged proteins are attracted to negatively charged surfaces (Mahmoudi et al., 2011).

                            "For iLNPs, it has been shown that in Onpattro, there is a close relationship between the protein corona and the target organ of delivery, mediated through the adsorption of Alipoprotein E onto the iLNP surface. Authors proposed that binding to ApoE will act as a highly effective targeting ligand by binding to lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, triggering the uptake by hepatocytes (45,79). This relationship between the protein corona and the biodistribution of NPs could allow the fate of the particles to be actively altered. Indeed, the multifunctional physicochemical properties of lipids can be designed to target different body tissues. Min Qiu et al. (80) have achieved a lung-selective delivery in mice with the use of a series of ionizable lipids containing an amide bond in the tail which changes the interactions between plasma proteins in contrast with other types of lipids, like the ones with an ester bond in the PEG lipidic tail (as those present in the approved formulations), which easily accumulate in the liver (81)."

This disparity in charge led us to hypothesize that it significantly influences plasma protein adsorption on nanoparticle surface in circulation, thereby dictating tissue specificity. To verify this hypothesis, we performed proteomic profiling of the surface-absorbed protein of LSNPs incubated with murine serum. After isolating surfaceadsorbed proteins, mass spectrometry analysis revealed distinct protein corona composition for these nanoparticles. Lung-targeted nanoparticles harbored 375 proteins, while liver-targeted ones contained 433 proteins, with 277 proteins common to both (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). A Venn diagram illustrated the protein distribution (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B), indicating 98 unique proteins to lung-targeted nanoparticles. Among the top twenty most abundant proteins, only nine were shared between the two types of nanoparticles. Notably, liver-targeted nanoparticles predominantly exhibited apolipoprotein A (ApoA), aligning with prior reports of the role of ApoA in hepatic-targeting delivery (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C) (24,25)."

                            "After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics (Foroozandeh et al., 2015)(Caracciolo et al., 2017). At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017). Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time (Gao et al., 2014). The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug (Gunawan et al., 2014)(Lazarovits et al., 2015). A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances (Aggarwal et al., 2009)(Suk et al., 2016)(Mogo\u0219anu et al., 2016)."

                            "Nanomaterials hold promise as multifunctional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the effective application of nanomaterials is hampered by limited understanding and control over their interactions with complex biological systems. When a nanomaterial enters a physiological environment, it rapidly adsorbs proteins forming what is known as the protein 'corona'. The protein corona alters the size and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a biological identity that is distinct from its synthetic identity. The biological identity determines the physiological response including signalling, kinetics, transport, accumulation, and toxicity. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (size, shape, and composition), the nature of the physiological environment (blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm, etc.), and the duration of exposure. In this critical review, we discuss the formation of the protein corona, its structure and composition, and its influence on the physiological response. We also present an 'adsorbome' of 125 plasma proteins that are known to associate with nanomaterials. We further describe how the protein corona is related to the synthetic identity of a nanomaterial, and highlight efforts to control protein-nanomaterial interactions. We conclude by discussing gaps in the understanding of protein-nanomaterial interactions along with strategies to fill them (167 references)."

In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action."

                            "Surface nanotopograpy has been recognized as an important regulator of cellular responses including those of immune cells, the latter being of particular importance for implantable materials since these can determine biomaterial fate. In this paper, evidence is provided that the scale of surface nanotopography modulates the conformation of attached serum proteins, which in turn controls immune cell adhesion and activation. Model surfaces of tailored nanotopography of heights of 16, 38, and 68 nm are created by covalent immobilization of gold nanoparticles to an oxazoline\u2010rich plasma polymer film. This strategy not only produces surfaces of tailored nanofeature density but allows control of the outermost surface chemistry. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and Mac\u20101 positive THP\u20101 monocytes studies demonstrate distinct protein unfolding patterns, which upregulate or downregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cells attachment. The findings presented in this paper shed light on the missing relationship between surface nanotopography, protein unfolding, and the immune response. On the other hand, this work demonstrates the possibility to use specifically tailored surface nanotoporaphy scales to modulate and achieve desired immune responses."

                            "Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its \"synthetic identity\", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct \"biological identity\". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials."

                            "Upon contact with plasma or other protein-containing biological fluids, the surface of nanoparticles is immediately decorated with proteins forming a biologically active protein corona. The biological fates and functions of nanoparticles are determined by physiological responses toward these nanoparticle-protein corona complexes as the effective biological unit of nanoparticles. In this article, we review representative studies on the effects of particle physicochemical characteristics along with the protein profiles in the biological medium on the formation of protein corona and importantly, how the dynamic nature and protein fingerprints of the formed corona govern the biological responses toward nanoparticles. The biological effects arising from the presence of protein corona can be both beneficial and unfavourable to the biomedical applications of nanoparticles. The protein corona-cell interactions open up the feasibility of targeted delivery and cell-specific uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles and in other circumstances, engineering of nanoparticles as adjuvants for vaccine development as well as mitigation of the unintentional cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the protein corona-cell interactions could induce rapid clearance of nanoparticles from in vivo circulation as well as activating unwanted inflammatory responses. Taken together, the knowledge on the formation and biological effects of protein corona enables tailored tuning of the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, unique to their intended biological activity."

It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90].\", \"Although the inclusion of targeting ligands has been shown to enhance the delivery and therapeutic efficiency of mRNA-LNPs, it should be noted that attaching targeting moieties may add complexity, cost, and regulatory difficulties to the process of manufacturing LNP systems [106]. In addition, the targeting specificity of some targeting ligands may disappear when lipid nanoparticles are exposed to biological fluids where interaction with proteins in the media and the consequent formation of protein corona takes place [107].\", \"The differences in site-specific targeting and organ distribution after systemic administration of mRNA-LNP formulations can be attributed to the biomolecular corona and surface charge of LNPs. For example, adsorption of apolipoprotein E as a targeting ligand led to specific hepatic uptake of (si)RNA from ionizable (or near neutral) LNPs, but not from cationic LNPs [111].\"]}",

This transformation has profound implications for the therapeutic efficacy, biodistribution, and safety of LNP-based drug delivery systems <Paper corpusId=\"254318207\" paperTitle=\"(Sartori et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe biological impact of protein corona begins with altered cellular interactions. The corona may interfere with nanoparticle-cell interactions, potentially triggering immune responses and affecting drug release efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"254318207\" paperTitle=\"(Sartori et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Proteins in the corona can function as opsonins (e.g., immunoglobulins, fibronectin, and complement proteins) that facilitate recognition and uptake by phagocytic cells, promoting elimination of the nanoparticles from circulation <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, certain corona proteins such as serum albumin and some apolipoproteins act as dysopsonins that enhance circulation time <Paper corpusId=\"55245252\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe corona composition dramatically influences organ-specific targeting of LNPs. Most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration due to the adsorption of ApoE, which binds to lipoprotein receptors that are over-expressed on hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism is exploited in clinically approved therapies but can be a significant barrier when targeting non-liver tissues. Research has shown that LNPs with different pKa values demonstrate distinct organ-targeting capabilities: LNPs with pKa ranges of 6.2-6.5 target the liver, 2-6 target the spleen, and 7-9 target the lung <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"40205755\" paperTitle=\"(Jayaraman et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHeterogeneity in protein corona formation presents both challenges and opportunities. Studies have revealed significant variability in protein corona formation even within seemingly uniform nanoparticle populations <Paper corpusId=\"263336887\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Feiner-Gracia et al. found that small differences in native nanoparticle surface chemistry were amplified upon protein adsorption, yielding particles with distinct biological identities <Paper corpusId=\"263336887\" paperTitle=\"(Saunders et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22709496\" paperTitle=\"(Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.

To address this issue, various surface modification strategies, such as polymer coatings, have been developed to reduce protein adsorption and extend circulation time <Paper corpusId=\"55245252\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe dynamic nature of the protein corona adds another layer of complexity to its biological impact. Initially, the corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins that are abundant in the biological medium. Over time, the composition evolves to include more high-affinity proteins <Paper corpusId=\"55245252\" paperTitle=\"(Ianni et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics (Foroozandeh et al., 2015)(Caracciolo et al., 2017). At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017). Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time (Gao et al., 2014). The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug (Gunawan et al., 2014)(Lazarovits et al., 2015). A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances (Aggarwal et al., 2009)(Suk et al., 2016)(Mogo\u0219anu et al., 2016)."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity.

Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (Rabanel et al., 2019)(Stater et al., 2021). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (Shang et al., 2017). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (Najer et al., 2022). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation."

                            "The adsorption of serum proteins, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, is a key determinant of the biological identity of nanoparticles in vivo. Therefore, gaining knowledge on the formation, composition, and temporal evolution of the corona is of utmost importance for the development of nanoparticle-based therapies. Here, it is shown that the use of super-resolution optical microscopy enables the imaging of the protein corona on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity. Particle-by-particle quantification reveals a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption under native conditions. Moreover, the diversity of the corona evolves over time depending on the surface chemistry and degradability of the particles. This paper investigates the consequences of protein adsorption for specific cell targeting by antibody-functionalized nanoparticles providing a detailed understanding of corona-activity relations. The methodology is widely applicable to a variety of nanostructures and complements the existing ensemble approaches for protein corona study."

For instance, the polymer surface coverage and distribution of ligands on nanoparticles are described with averaged values obtained from quantification techniques based on particle populations. However, these averaged values may conceal heterogeneities at different levels, either because of the presence of particle sub-populations or because of surface inhomogeneities, such as patchy surfaces on individual particles. The characterization and quantification of chemical surface heterogeneities are tedious tasks, which are rather limited by the currently available instruments and research protocols. However, heterogeneities may contribute to some non-linear effects observed during the nanoformulation optimization process, cause problems related to nanocarrier production scale-up and correlate with unexpected biological outcomes. On the other hand, heterogeneities, while usually unintended and detrimental to nanocarrier performance, may, in some cases, be sought as adjustable properties that provide NPs with unique functionality. In this review, results and processes related to this issue are compiled, and perspectives and possible analytical developments are discussed."

Typically, less than 10% of all systemically administered nanoparticles accumulate in the tumour. Here we explore the interactions of blood components with nanoparticles and describe how these interactions influence solid tumour targeting. In the blood, serum proteins adsorb onto nanoparticles to form a protein corona in a manner dependent on nanoparticle physicochemical properties. These serum proteins can block nanoparticle tumour targeting ligands from binding to tumour cell receptors. Additionally, serum proteins can also encourage nanoparticle uptake by macrophages, which decreases nanoparticle availability in the blood and limits tumour accumulation. The formation of this protein corona will also increase the nanoparticle hydrodynamic size or induce aggregation, which makes nanoparticles too large to enter into the tumour through pores of the leaky vessels, and prevents their deep penetration into tumours for cell targeting. Recent studies have focused on developing new chemical strategies to reduce or eliminate serum protein adsorption, and rescue the targeting potential of nanoparticles to tumour cells. An in-depth and complete understanding of nanoparticle-blood interactions is key to designing nanoparticles with optimal physicochemical properties with high tumour accumulation. The purpose of this review article is to describe how the protein corona alters the targeting of nanoparticles to solid tumours and explains current solutions to solve this problem."

The biological fates and functions of nanoparticles are determined by physiological responses toward these nanoparticle-protein corona complexes as the effective biological unit of nanoparticles. In this article, we review representative studies on the effects of particle physicochemical characteristics along with the protein profiles in the biological medium on the formation of protein corona and importantly, how the dynamic nature and protein fingerprints of the formed corona govern the biological responses toward nanoparticles. The biological effects arising from the presence of protein corona can be both beneficial and unfavourable to the biomedical applications of nanoparticles. The protein corona-cell interactions open up the feasibility of targeted delivery and cell-specific uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles and in other circumstances, engineering of nanoparticles as adjuvants for vaccine development as well as mitigation of the unintentional cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the protein corona-cell interactions could induce rapid clearance of nanoparticles from in vivo circulation as well as activating unwanted inflammatory responses. Taken together, the knowledge on the formation and biological effects of protein corona enables tailored tuning of the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, unique to their intended biological activity."

                            "Nanotechnology holds great promise for applications in many fields including biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the processes occurring at the interface between nanomaterials and living systems are exceedingly complex and not yet well understood, which has significantly hampered the realization of many nanobiotechnology applications. Whenever nanoparticles (NPs) are incorporated by a living organism, a protein adsorption layer, also known as the \"protein corona\", forms on the NP surface. Accordingly, living organisms interact with protein-coated rather than bare NPs, and their biological responses depend on the nature of the protein corona. In recent years, a wide variety of biophysical techniques have been employed to elucidate mechanistic aspects of NP-protein interactions. In most studies, NPs are immersed in protein or biofluid (e.g., blood serum) solutions and then separated from the liquid for analysis. Because this approach may modify the composition and structure of the protein corona, our group has pioneered the use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) as an in situ technique, capable of examining NP-protein interactions while the NPs are suspended in biological fluids. FCS allows us to measure, with subnanometer precision and as a function of protein concentration, the increase in hydrodynamic radius of the NPs due to protein adsorption. This Account aims at reviewing recent progress in the exploration of NP-protein interactions by using FCS. In vitro FCS studies of the adsorption of important serum proteins onto water-solubilized luminescent NPs always showed a stepwise increase of the NP radius upon protein binding in the form of a binding isotherm, regardless of the type of NP and its specific surface functionalization. This observation indicates formation of a protein monolayer on the NP. Structure-based calculations of protein surface potentials revealed that positively charged patches on the proteins interact electrostatically with negatively charged NP surfaces, and the observed protein layer thickness always matched the known molecular dimensions of the proteins binding in certain orientations. Temperature and NP surface functionalization have also been identified as important parameters controlling protein corona formation. Notably, while the corona formed from a single type of serum protein was reversible, protein adsorption from complex biological media such as blood serum was entirely irreversible. These quantitative in vitro studies are of great relevance to the bio-nano community and especially to researchers developing engineered nanomaterials for biological and biomedical applications. Future efforts will be directed toward elucidating kinetic aspects of protein corona formation and the detailed structure of the adsorbed proteins at the molecular level. To better appreciate the biological responses triggered by NP exposure, more efforts will be devoted to the exploration of the biomolecular corona as it forms on NPs in contact with living cells, tissues, and even entire model organisms. These studies are challenging when performed in a well-controlled and quantitative fashion and rely on the availability of sophisticated analytical tools, particularly, quantitative optical imaging techniques including FCS and related fluctuation methods."

For instance, the polymer surface coverage and distribution of ligands on nanoparticles are described with averaged values obtained from quantification techniques based on particle populations. However, these averaged values may conceal heterogeneities at different levels, either because of the presence of particle sub-populations or because of surface inhomogeneities, such as patchy surfaces on individual particles. The characterization and quantification of chemical surface heterogeneities are tedious tasks, which are rather limited by the currently available instruments and research protocols. However, heterogeneities may contribute to some non-linear effects observed during the nanoformulation optimization process, cause problems related to nanocarrier production scale-up and correlate with unexpected biological outcomes. On the other hand, heterogeneities, while usually unintended and detrimental to nanocarrier performance, may, in some cases, be sought as adjustable properties that provide NPs with unique functionality. In this review, results and processes related to this issue are compiled, and perspectives and possible analytical developments are discussed."

                            "Nanotechnology holds great promise for applications in many fields including biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the processes occurring at the interface between nanomaterials and living systems are exceedingly complex and not yet well understood, which has significantly hampered the realization of many nanobiotechnology applications. Whenever nanoparticles (NPs) are incorporated by a living organism, a protein adsorption layer, also known as the \"protein corona\", forms on the NP surface. Accordingly, living organisms interact with protein-coated rather than bare NPs, and their biological responses depend on the nature of the protein corona. In recent years, a wide variety of biophysical techniques have been employed to elucidate mechanistic aspects of NP-protein interactions. In most studies, NPs are immersed in protein or biofluid (e.g., blood serum) solutions and then separated from the liquid for analysis. Because this approach may modify the composition and structure of the protein corona, our group has pioneered the use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) as an in situ technique, capable of examining NP-protein interactions while the NPs are suspended in biological fluids. FCS allows us to measure, with subnanometer precision and as a function of protein concentration, the increase in hydrodynamic radius of the NPs due to protein adsorption. This Account aims at reviewing recent progress in the exploration of NP-protein interactions by using FCS. In vitro FCS studies of the adsorption of important serum proteins onto water-solubilized luminescent NPs always showed a stepwise increase of the NP radius upon protein binding in the form of a binding isotherm, regardless of the type of NP and its specific surface functionalization. This observation indicates formation of a protein monolayer on the NP. Structure-based calculations of protein surface potentials revealed that positively charged patches on the proteins interact electrostatically with negatively charged NP surfaces, and the observed protein layer thickness always matched the known molecular dimensions of the proteins binding in certain orientations. Temperature and NP surface functionalization have also been identified as important parameters controlling protein corona formation. Notably, while the corona formed from a single type of serum protein was reversible, protein adsorption from complex biological media such as blood serum was entirely irreversible. These quantitative in vitro studies are of great relevance to the bio-nano community and especially to researchers developing engineered nanomaterials for biological and biomedical applications. Future efforts will be directed toward elucidating kinetic aspects of protein corona formation and the detailed structure of the adsorbed proteins at the molecular level. To better appreciate the biological responses triggered by NP exposure, more efforts will be devoted to the exploration of the biomolecular corona as it forms on NPs in contact with living cells, tissues, and even entire model organisms. These studies are challenging when performed in a well-controlled and quantitative fashion and rely on the availability of sophisticated analytical tools, particularly, quantitative optical imaging techniques including FCS and related fluctuation methods."

                            "In the past few decades, it has been well shown that the protein corona formation on nanoparticles' surfaces influences their in vivo fate and may significantly interfere with the targeting yields, biodistribution, and cell internalization of nano-delivery systems (Bros et al., 2018)(Zhang et al., 2019). Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands (Tekie et al., 2020). Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo",
                            "From the results presented in Table 2, it can be concluded that the formulations prepared with no stealth polymer on their surface tended to have a significantly higher % of plasma protein adsorption (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0290 for NL and NLC, respectively; p < 0.05; ANOVA) compared to the formulations containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG) or POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL). The obtained results were expected, since PEGylation has been a traditionally used method for reducing the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins (Shalabalija et al., 2021)(Pelaz et al., 2015)."

PEG was covalently linked to the polymer surface to the maximal grafting density achievable under our experimental conditions. Changes in the effective hydrodynamic radius of the NPs upon adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) and fibrinogen (FIB) were measured in situ using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. For NPs without a PEG shell, a thickness increase of around 3 nm, corresponding to HSA monolayer adsorption, was measured at high HSA concentration. Only 50% of this value was found for NPs with PEGylated surfaces. While the size increase clearly reveals formation of a protein corona also for PEGylated NPs, fluorescence lifetime measurements and quenching experiments suggest that the adsorbed HSA molecules are buried within the PEG shell. For FIB adsorption onto PEGylated NPs, even less change in NP diameter was observed. In vitro uptake of the NPs by 3T3 fibroblasts was reduced to around 10% upon PEGylation with PEG chains of 10 kDa. Thus, even though the PEG coatings did not completely prevent protein adsorption, the PEGylated NPs still displayed a pronounced reduction of cellular uptake with respect to bare NPs, which is to be expected if the adsorbed proteins are not exposed on the NP surface."

                            "Protein corona presents a major obstacle to bench-to-bedside translation of targeted drug delivery systems, severely affecting targeting yields and directing unfavorable biodistribution. Corona-mediated targeting provides a new impetus for specific drug delivery by precisely manipulating interaction modes of functional plasma proteins on nano-surface. Here bio-inspired liposomes (SP-sLip) were developed by modifying liposomal surface with a short nontoxic peptide derived from A\u03b21-42 that specifically interacts with the lipid-binding domain of exchangeable apolipoproteins. SP-sLip absorb plasma apolipoproteins A1, E and J, consequently exposing receptor-binding domain of apolipoproteins to achieve brain-targeted delivery. Doxorubicin loaded SP-sLip (SP-sLip/DOX) show significant enhancement of brain distribution and anti-brain cancer effect in comparison to doxorubicin loaded plain liposomes. SP-sLip preserve functions of the absorbed human plasma ApoE, and the corona-mediated targeting strategy works in SP modified PLGA nanoparticles. The present study may pave a new avenue to facilitate clinical translation of targeted drug delivery systems. Plasma proteins may severely affect the in vivo performance of liposomes. Here, the authors develop bio-inspired liposomes that specifically absorb brain-targeted apolipoproteins and preserve their bioactivities, thereby achieving efficient brain targeting with minor influence on immunocompatibility of liposomes."

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2019) investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

                            "The application of lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems remains a popular strategy for the systemic delivery of gene therapies to specific disease targets, including solid tumors. It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

                            "After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics (Foroozandeh et al., 2015)(Caracciolo et al., 2017). At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins (Caracciolo et al., 2017). Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time (Gao et al., 2014). The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug (Gunawan et al., 2014)(Lazarovits et al., 2015). A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances (Aggarwal et al., 2009)(Suk et al., 2016)(Mogo\u0219anu et al., 2016)."

Therefore, as was recently recognised, a better understanding and modulation of the complex surface interactions of nanomedicines in biological environments is key for aiding clinical translation (Rabanel et al., 2019)(Stater et al., 2021). Utilising single particle the protein binding affinity and kinetics (Shang et al., 2017). An alternative FCS technique is to randomly label plasma and then to mix with unlabelled nanoparticles to detecting protein fouling, which is a highly sensitive method but requires using diluted plasma or studying individually labelled plasma proteins (Najer et al., 2022). Nevertheless, observed differences between PEG-decorated polymersomes and liposomes provided important links between the copolymer membrane material properties, particle PEG-density and resulting corona formation."

                            "The adsorption of serum proteins, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, is a key determinant of the biological identity of nanoparticles in vivo. Therefore, gaining knowledge on the formation, composition, and temporal evolution of the corona is of utmost importance for the development of nanoparticle-based therapies. Here, it is shown that the use of super-resolution optical microscopy enables the imaging of the protein corona on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity. Particle-by-particle quantification reveals a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption under native conditions. Moreover, the diversity of the corona evolves over time depending on the surface chemistry and degradability of the particles. This paper investigates the consequences of protein adsorption for specific cell targeting by antibody-functionalized nanoparticles providing a detailed understanding of corona-activity relations. The methodology is widely applicable to a variety of nanostructures and complements the existing ensemble approaches for protein corona study."

Designed PECs have low amounts of proteins in corona mostly enriched by Apolipoproteins, protein C, hemoglobin subunits, and inter-alpha- trypsin inhibitor that beside improving uptake of nanoparticles, they have low liver uptake and notable heart blood pool accumulation that confirmed the long circulation time of the nanoparticles which is favorable for delivery of nanoparticles to the site of action and achieving required therapeutic effect."
