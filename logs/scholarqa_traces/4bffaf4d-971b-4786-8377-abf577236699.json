However, over-production of heterologous proteins in E. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO).ResultsWe have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191\u2013345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively.ConclusionThe refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.",

However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides [3]. Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding [4]. Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers [5,6]. Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization can dominate the rate and pathway of protein folding and in turn determine the refolding efficiency [7,8].\n\nAt least two classes of cellular factors are currently known to assist in vivo or in vitro protein folding.

            "abstract": "BackgroundAcetylation of lysine residues is a reversible post-translational modification conserved from bacteria to humans. Several recent studies have revealed hundreds of lysine-acetylated proteins in various bacteria; however, the physiological role of these modifications remains largely unknown. Since lysine acetylation changes the size and charge of proteins and thereby may affect their conformation, we assumed that lysine acetylation can stimulate aggregation of proteins, especially for overproduced recombinant proteins that form inclusion bodies.ResultsTo verify this assumption, we used Escherichia coli strains that overproduce aggregation-prone VP1GFP protein. We found that in \u0394ackA-pta cells, which display diminished protein acetylation, inclusion bodies were formed with a delay and processed faster than in the wild-type cells. Moreover, in \u0394ackA-pta cells, inclusion bodies exhibited significantly increased specific GFP fluorescence. In CobB deacetylase-deficient cells, in which protein acetylation was enhanced, the formation of inclusion bodies was increased and their processing was significantly inhibited. Similar results were obtained with regard to endogenous protein aggregates formed during the late stationary phase in \u0394ackA-pta and \u0394cobB cells.ConclusionsOur studies revealed that protein acetylation affected the aggregation of endogenous E. coli proteins and the yield, solubility, and biological activity of a model recombinant protein. In general, decreased lysine acetylation inhibited the formation of protein aggregates, whereas increased lysine acetylation stabilized protein aggregates. These findings should be considered during the designing of efficient strategies for the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli cells.",

There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields [1]. Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs [2,3]. To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins [1][2][3]. A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs [4][5][6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product [7]. \n\nAnother obstacle in recombinant protein production in E. coli cells is accumulation of acetate during extensive aerobic fermentation in cultures supplemented with glucose. At higher glucose concentrations, the carbon flux into the cells exceeds tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, and acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate, which is easily excreted from the cell. The excretion of acetate into the environment results also from the need to regenerate the NAD + consumed by glycolysis and to recycle the CoA that is required to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [8]. A high concentration of acetate, externally added or excreted from the cell, limits the growth of E. coli.",

The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ].

The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding [30].

Bora, Mohamed Ahmed\n## Abstract\nPlasmids are important vectors for the transfer of genetic material among microbes. The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.\n## Plasmids carrying molecular chaperones for optimization of protein folding\nProduction of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins.

The basal E. coli protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network capacity is often insufficient to efficiently fold overexpressed proteins. Herein we demonstrate that a transcriptionally reprogrammed E. coli proteostasis network is generally superior for producing soluble, folded, and functional recombinant proteins. Reprogramming is accomplished by overexpressing a negative feedback deficient heat-shock response transcription factor before and during overexpression of the protein-of-interest. The advantage of transcriptional reprogramming versus simply overexpressing select proteostasis network components (e.g., chaperones and co-chaperones, which has been explored previously) is that a large number of proteostasis network components are upregulated at their evolved stoichiometry, thus maintaining the system capabilities of the proteostasis network that are currently incompletely understood. Transcriptional proteostasis network reprogramming mediated by stress-responsive signaling in the absence of stress should also be useful for protein production in other cells.",

Escherichia coli is an easily cultured organism often used for recombinant protein production; however, the quantity obtained of a soluble, folded, and functional protein-of-interest is often undesirably low, because many proteins-of-interest aggregate to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm when overexpressed. 1 This happens because the innate E. coli proteostasis network capacity is insufficient to support the efficient folding of large quantities of a protein-of-interest as well as the endogenous proteome during bacterial cell growth. Therefore, one potentially general strategy to improve recombinant protein production is to enhance the E. coli's proteostasis network capacity to facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins during their overexpression, without compromising the folding of the endogenous proteome. 2,3 \u22127 Overexpression of select proteostasis network components, such as the molecular chaperones (DnaK), and/or co-chaperones (DnaJ and GrpE), and/or chaperonins (GroEL and GroES), either alone or in combination, effectively increases the biosynthetic yield of certain proteins-of-interest. 8\u221211 However, this approach is limited\ue0d5individual chaperones often handle specific protein substrates, 12,13 making it difficult to predict a priori a suitable chaperone system for a specific protein. \u221213 The E. coli cytosolic proteostasis network is transcriptionally regulated by the heat-shock response (HSR) stress-responsive signaling pathway. 14 \u221218 The HSR transcriptional program is controlled by the transcriptional factor \u03c332, 19 whose induction through stress has been shown to elevate the mRNA and protein levels of the majority of proteostasis network components. 20",

Genereux, C. Nolan, Meha Singh, J. Kelly\n## Abstract\nThe biosynthesis of soluble, properly folded recombinant proteins in large quantities from Escherichia coli is desirable for academic research and industrial protein production. The basal E. coli protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network capacity is often insufficient to efficiently fold overexpressed proteins. Herein we demonstrate that a transcriptionally reprogrammed E. coli proteostasis network is generally superior for producing soluble, folded, and functional recombinant proteins. Reprogramming is accomplished by overexpressing a negative feedback deficient heat-shock response transcription factor before and during overexpression of the protein-of-interest. The advantage of transcriptional reprogramming versus simply overexpressing select proteostasis network components (e.g., chaperones and co-chaperones, which has been explored previously) is that a large number of proteostasis network components are upregulated at their evolved stoichiometry, thus maintaining the system capabilities of the proteostasis network that are currently incompletely understood. Transcriptional proteostasis network reprogramming mediated by stress-responsive signaling in the absence of stress should also be useful for protein production in other cells.\n## body\nP roduction of large quantities of soluble, properly folded, and functional recombinant proteins-of-interest remains a major challenge in both academic and industrial settings. Escherichia coli is an easily cultured organism often used for recombinant protein production; however, the quantity obtained of a soluble, folded, and functional protein-of-interest is often undesirably low, because many proteins-of-interest aggregate to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm when overexpressed. 1 This happens because the innate E. coli proteostasis network capacity is insufficient to support the efficient folding of large quantities of a protein-of-interest as well as the endogenous proteome during bacterial cell growth. Therefore, one potentially general strategy to improve recombinant protein production is to enhance the E. coli's proteostasis network capacity to facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins during their overexpression, without compromising the folding of the endogenous proteome. 2,3 \u22127 Overexpression of select proteostasis network components, such as the molecular chaperones (DnaK), and/or co-chaperones (DnaJ and GrpE), and/or chaperonins (GroEL and GroES), either alone or in combination, effectively increases the biosynthetic yield of certain proteins-of-interest. 8\u221211 However, this approach is limited\ue0d5individual chaperones often handle specific protein substrates, 12,13 making it difficult to predict a priori a suitable chaperone system for a specific protein. \u221213 The E. coli cytosolic proteostasis network is transcriptionally regulated by the heat-shock response (HSR) stress-responsive signaling pathway. 14 \u221218 The HSR transcriptional program is controlled by the transcriptional factor \u03c332, 19 whose induction through stress has been shown to elevate the mRNA and protein levels of the majority of proteostasis network components. 20",

The presence of misfolded or folding-reluctant protein species causes considerable stress in host cells. The characterization of such adverse conditions and the elicited cell responses have permitted to better understand the physiology and molecular biology of conformational stress.

For production processes being efficient, foreign genes are expressed from plasmids and under the control of inducible promoters, what results into non physiological and unusually high transcription rates. Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109,110]. The specificity in protein aggregation makes inclusion bodies highly pure in composition and therefore enriched in the recombinant protein itself. However, also truncated versions of the recombinant product, other plasmid-encoded proteins, but also defined host cell proteins can get entrapped within bacterial inclusion bodies [111][112][113][114][115][116]. Moreover, the presence of folding assistant proteins in inclusion bodies [117-119] confirm that specific interactions lead to entrappment of cellular proteins in these aggregates. The high purity of inclusion bodies makes them a convenient source of easily extractable protein that must be refolded in vitro by denaturing procedures, a fact that has been largely exploited for biotechnology purposes",

                    "text": "Folding failures of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is generally attributed to a limitation in the cell concentration of folding assistant elements, which cannot process the newly synthesized aggregation prone polypeptides. This assumption is physiologically supported by the overexpression of chaperone genes, in particular of chaperone genes from the heat-shock protein family, in response to recombinant protein overproduction [126,127,133]. Thus, coproduction of the main heat shock chaperones (specially GroEL and DnaK) together with the target protein has been largely explored as a way to minimize aggregation and to enhance the solubility of the recombinant protein product (reviewed in [140][141][142][143]). In many cases, solubility has been significantly enhanced by coexpression of individual chaperone genes, while in others an even negative effect on product stability and host viability has been observed. Selection of the suitable chaperone(s) is still a trial-and-error process. However, more recent results indicate that complete chaperones gene sets rather than individual chaperone genes with synergistic and/or cooperative activities (such as DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES sets) will lead to a more predictable improvement of target protein solubility. [144][145][146][147].\n\nInterestingly, when producing enzymes or fluorescent proteins in DnaKcells, the biological activities and therefore the conformational quality of aggregated polypeptides is much more close to that of soluble versions, compared to wild type cells [148][149][150]. Furthermore, the overexpression of the dnaK gene along with a model GFP recombinant protein dramatically reduces the specific fluorescence of a GFP fusion in both soluble and insoluble versions [151]. This indicates that DnaK directly or indirectly impairs the folding state of the aggregated proteins.\n\nIn this regard, the production of GFP variants in absence of DnaK results in highly fluorescent inclusion bodies [152]. In these cells, both the protein yield and quality were dramatically enhanced although the solubility is lower than in the wild type, as expected",

Mattanovich, Antonio Villaverde\n## Abstract\nDifferent species of microorganisms including yeasts, filamentous fungi and bacteria have been used in the past 25 years for the controlled production of foreign proteins of scientific, pharmacological or industrial interest. A major obstacle for protein production processes and a limit to overall success has been the abundance of misfolded polypeptides, which fail to reach their native conformation. The presence of misfolded or folding-reluctant protein species causes considerable stress in host cells. The characterization of such adverse conditions and the elicited cell responses have permitted to better understand the physiology and molecular biology of conformational stress. Therefore, microbial cell factories for recombinant protein production are depicted here as a source of knowledge that has considerably helped to picture the extremely rich landscape of in vivo protein folding, and the main cellular players of this complex process are described for the most important cell factories used for biotechnological purposes.\n## Protein folding and conformational stress in prokaryotic cells\nSince early recombinant DNA times, bacteria (especially E. coli) have been the most widely used microorganisms for recombinant protein production due to genetic simplicity, fast growth rate, high cell density production and availability of a spectrum of genetic systems, among others. For production processes being efficient, foreign genes are expressed from plasmids and under the control of inducible promoters, what results into non physiological and unusually high transcription rates. Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109,110]. The specificity in protein aggregation makes inclusion bodies highly pure in composition and therefore enriched in the recombinant protein itself. However, also truncated versions of the recombinant product, other plasmid-encoded proteins, but also defined host cell proteins can get entrapped within bacterial inclusion bodies [111][112][113][114][115][116]. Moreover, the presence of folding assistant proteins in inclusion bodies [117-119] confirm that specific interactions lead to entrappment of cellular proteins in these aggregates. The high purity of inclusion bodies makes them a convenient source of easily extractable protein that must be refolded in vitro by denaturing procedures, a fact that has been largely exploited for biotechnology purposes\n...\nand MopB among others) but also other ones not directly involved in protein quality (such as YagU, YojH, YbeD and others) and whose precise role remains to be identified.

Protein aggregates already exist in the soluble cell fraction, and can involve native or quasi-native protein species. The main cytoplasmic chaperones involved in the protein folding process (red arrows) include the trigger factor, DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL and GroES. Both soluble aggregates and individual protein species can enter the virtual insoluble cell fraction (indicated by a dashed line) and deposit as inclusion bodies, in a fully reversible process (green arrows). Protein release from inclusion bodies is mainly controlled by DnaK, ClpB and IbpA,B. Proteases (lon, ClpP and others) attack both soluble and insoluble species with folding defects. In particular, proteases degrade inclusion body proteins in situ, or through a more complex process intimately related to the protein release process, and therefore, strongly dependent\n\n## Chaperones and protein degradation\nFolding failures of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is generally attributed to a limitation in the cell concentration of folding assistant elements, which cannot process the newly synthesized aggregation prone polypeptides. This assumption is physiologically supported by the overexpression of chaperone genes, in particular of chaperone genes from the heat-shock protein family, in response to recombinant protein overproduction [126,127,133]. Thus, coproduction of the main heat shock chaperones (specially GroEL and DnaK) together with the target protein has been largely explored as a way to minimize aggregation and to enhance the solubility of the recombinant protein product (reviewed in [140][141][142][143]). In many cases, solubility has been significantly enhanced by coexpression of individual chaperone genes, while in others an even negative effect on product stability and host viability has been observed. Selection of the suitable chaperone(s) is still a trial-and-error process. However, more recent results indicate that complete chaperones gene sets rather than individual chaperone genes with synergistic and/or cooperative activities (such as DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES sets) will lead to a more predictable improvement of target protein solubility. [144][145][146][147].\n\nInterestingly, when producing enzymes or fluorescent proteins in DnaKcells, the biological activities and therefore the conformational quality of aggregated polypeptides is much more close to that of soluble versions, compared to wild type cells [148][149][150]. Furthermore, the overexpression of the dnaK gene along with a model GFP recombinant protein dramatically reduces the specific fluorescence of a GFP fusion in both soluble and insoluble versions [151]. This indicates that DnaK directly or indirectly impairs the folding state of the aggregated proteins.\n\nIn this regard, the production of GFP variants in absence of DnaK results in highly fluorescent inclusion bodies [152]. In these cells, both the protein yield and quality were dramatically enhanced although the solubility is lower than in the wild type, as expected",

We propose here an updated survey of the most effective and appropriate methods of preparation of antibody fragments that exploit E. coli as an expression background and review the pros and cons of the different platforms available today.

On the other hand, the newly synthesized recombinant polypeptide is expressed in the microenvironment of the host that may differ from that of the original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, cofactors, and folding mechanisms. High local concentrations of the nascent heterologous protein together with an insufficient amount of folding-promoting chaperons may lead to partially folded or misfolded protein intermediates that give rise to the formation, in both the cytoplasm and periplasm, of insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies, IBs [77]. Usually, these intermediates expose on their surface hydrophobic patches that interact with similar regions and together with the formation of uncorrected disulfide bonds can lead to protein aggregation and precipitation Protein recovery strategies from inclusion bodies via solubilization and refolding processes are laborious, time-consuming and expensive, although various refolding procedures have been developed for therapeutic proteins and applied for antibody fragments [78][79][80]. An introduction to the IB refolding procedure [81] is outside the scope of this review. Rather, we will look at other more profitable and convenient strategies such as periplasmic and extracellular expression strategies and also co-expression with molecular chaperons for improving solubility and proper folding of antibody-like fragments, even on a laboratory scale.",

Sandomenico, Jwala Sivaccumar, M. Ruvo\n## Abstract\nAntibodies and antibody-derived molecules are continuously developed as both therapeutic agents and key reagents for advanced diagnostic investigations. Their application in these fields has indeed greatly expanded the demand of these molecules and the need for their production in high yield and purity. While full-length antibodies require mammalian expression systems due to the occurrence of functionally and structurally important glycosylations, most antibody fragments and antibody-like molecules are non-glycosylated and can be more conveniently prepared in E. coli-based expression platforms. We propose here an updated survey of the most effective and appropriate methods of preparation of antibody fragments that exploit E. coli as an expression background and review the pros and cons of the different platforms available today. Around 250 references accompany and complete the review together with some lists of the most important new antibody-like molecules that are on the market or are being developed as new biotherapeutics or diagnostic agents.\n## Inclusion Bodies\nE. coli loses the spatiotemporal control of its own protein synthesis machinery when an exogenous gene is introduced. On the other hand, the newly synthesized recombinant polypeptide is expressed in the microenvironment of the host that may differ from that of the original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, cofactors, and folding mechanisms. High local concentrations of the nascent heterologous protein together with an insufficient amount of folding-promoting chaperons may lead to partially folded or misfolded protein intermediates that give rise to the formation, in both the cytoplasm and periplasm, of insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies, IBs [77]. Usually, these intermediates expose on their surface hydrophobic patches that interact with similar regions and together with the formation of uncorrected disulfide bonds can lead to protein aggregation and precipitation Protein recovery strategies from inclusion bodies via solubilization and refolding processes are laborious, time-consuming and expensive, although various refolding procedures have been developed for therapeutic proteins and applied for antibody fragments [78][79][80]. An introduction to the IB refolding procedure [81] is outside the scope of this review. Rather, we will look at other more profitable and convenient strategies such as periplasmic and extracellular expression strategies and also co-expression with molecular chaperons for improving solubility and proper folding of antibody-like fragments, even on a laboratory scale.",

It has been established that in vivo protein folding is an energy dependent process mediated by two classes folding modulators; molecular chaperones-DnaK-Dn-aJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES systems, which suppress offpathway aggregation reaction and lead to the proper folding through ATP-coordinated cycle of binding and release of intermediates [78]. Additionally, it accelerates rate-limiting steps along the protein folding pathway such as cis-trans isomerization of peptide-prolyl bonds and formation/reshuffling of disulfide-bridges [79,80]. These two chaperone system holds great promise in facilitating the production, purification and proper folding of heterologous protein [81,82]. \n\nMolecular chaperone has three sub-classes based on their mechanism of actions [83]. \"Folding\" chaperones (e.g., DnaK and GroEL) as mentioned above, \"Holding\" chaperones (e.g. IbpB) maintain partially folded proteins on their surface to await availability of folding chaperones upon stress slack and the \"Disaggregating\" chaperone ClpB promotes the solubilization of the protein that became aggregated as a result of stress. The general mechanism of protein folding assisted by molecular chaperones is depicted in Figure 2 [84]. In Figure 2, A represents m-RNA which translates into unfolded-protein (U). In absence of any chaperone protein, U can fold back to its native form (N) along with the aggregationprocess which leads to inclusion-bodies (Z); but in presence of chaperone protein U solely folds back to its native form (N) via an intermediate (I) with chaperone protein without any aggregation path which leads to inclusion bodies. The path from I to N governs by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi.",

Atreya\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, high yield expression of proteins in E. \ncoli has witnessed rapid progress with developments of new methodologies \nand technologies. An important advancement has been the development of novel recombinant cloning approaches and protocols to express heterologous proteins \nfor Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies and for isotopic enrichment. \nIsotope labeling in NMR is necessary for rapid acquisition of high dimensional \nspectra for structural studies. In addition, higher yield of proteins using \nvarious solubility and affinity tags has made protein over-expression \ncost-effective. Taken together, these methods have opened new avenues for \nstructural studies of proteins and their interactions. This article deals \nwith the different techniques that are employed for over-expression of proteins \nin E. coli and different methods used for isotope labeling of proteins \nvis-a-vis NMR spectroscopy.\n## Co-Expression with Molecular Chaperones\nThe high level expression of recombinant gene products in E. coli often results in misfolding of the protein of interest and its subsequent degradation by cellular proteases or the deposition of the protein into biologi-cally inactive aggregates known as inclusion bodies [77]. It has been established that in vivo protein folding is an energy dependent process mediated by two classes folding modulators; molecular chaperones-DnaK-Dn-aJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES systems, which suppress offpathway aggregation reaction and lead to the proper folding through ATP-coordinated cycle of binding and release of intermediates [78]. Additionally, it accelerates rate-limiting steps along the protein folding pathway such as cis-trans isomerization of peptide-prolyl bonds and formation/reshuffling of disulfide-bridges [79,80]. These two chaperone system holds great promise in facilitating the production, purification and proper folding of heterologous protein [81,82]. \n\nMolecular chaperone has three sub-classes based on their mechanism of actions [83]. \"Folding\" chaperones (e.g., DnaK and GroEL) as mentioned above, \"Holding\" chaperones (e.g. IbpB) maintain partially folded proteins on their surface to await availability of folding chaperones upon stress slack and the \"Disaggregating\" chaperone ClpB promotes the solubilization of the protein that became aggregated as a result of stress. The general mechanism of protein folding assisted by molecular chaperones is depicted in Figure 2 [84]. In Figure 2, A represents m-RNA which translates into unfolded-protein (U). In absence of any chaperone protein, U can fold back to its native form (N) along with the aggregationprocess which leads to inclusion-bodies (Z); but in presence of chaperone protein U solely folds back to its native form (N) via an intermediate (I) with chaperone protein without any aggregation path which leads to inclusion bodies. The path from I to N governs by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi.",

A strategy was explored to overcome inclusion-body formation observed when expressing an aggregation-prone fungal xylanase in Escherichia coli. pHsh is an expression plasmid that uses a synthetic heat-shock (Hsh) promoter, in which gene expression is regulated by an alternative sigma factor (\u03c332). A derivative of pHsh was constructed by fusing a signal peptide to xynA2 gene to facilitate export of the recombinant protein to the periplasm. The xylanase was produced in a soluble form. Three factors were essential to achieving such soluble expression of the xylanase: 1) the target gene was under the control of the Hsh promoter, 2) the gene product was exported into the periplasm, and 3) gene expression was induced by a temperature upshift. For the first time we report the expression of periplasmic proteins under the control of an Hsh promoter regulated by \u03c332. One unique feature of this approach was that over 200 copies of the Hsh promoter in an E. coli cell significantly increased the concentration of \u03c332. The growth inhibition of the recombinant cells corresponded to an increase in the levels of soluble periplasmic protein. Therefore, an alternative protocol was designed to induce gene expression from pHsh-ex to obtain high levels of active soluble enzymes.",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1]. However, it is a common problem for recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and/or periplasm upon gene over-expression in E. coli [2,3]. This complex phenomenon has many contributing factors: insolubility of the product at the concentrations being produced, inability to fold correctly in the bacterial environment, or lack of appropriate bacterial chaperone proteins [4,5]. Several strategies are commonly employed to reduce inclusion bodies: a) controlling the rate of protein synthesis, b) enabling secretion into the periplasm, and c) co-expression of chaperone genes. The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [6]. The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing [1,5,7,8,9,10], although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm [11,12]. The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins [13,14,15,16]. Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins [17,18,19]. Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

Shao\n## Abstract\nThe development of new procedures and protocols that allow researchers to obtain recombinant proteins is of fundamental importance in the biotechnology field. A strategy was explored to overcome inclusion-body formation observed when expressing an aggregation-prone fungal xylanase in Escherichia coli. pHsh is an expression plasmid that uses a synthetic heat-shock (Hsh) promoter, in which gene expression is regulated by an alternative sigma factor (\u03c332). A derivative of pHsh was constructed by fusing a signal peptide to xynA2 gene to facilitate export of the recombinant protein to the periplasm. The xylanase was produced in a soluble form. Three factors were essential to achieving such soluble expression of the xylanase: 1) the target gene was under the control of the Hsh promoter, 2) the gene product was exported into the periplasm, and 3) gene expression was induced by a temperature upshift. For the first time we report the expression of periplasmic proteins under the control of an Hsh promoter regulated by \u03c332. One unique feature of this approach was that over 200 copies of the Hsh promoter in an E. coli cell significantly increased the concentration of \u03c332. The growth inhibition of the recombinant cells corresponded to an increase in the levels of soluble periplasmic protein. Therefore, an alternative protocol was designed to induce gene expression from pHsh-ex to obtain high levels of active soluble enzymes.\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1]. However, it is a common problem for recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and/or periplasm upon gene over-expression in E. coli [2,3]. This complex phenomenon has many contributing factors: insolubility of the product at the concentrations being produced, inability to fold correctly in the bacterial environment, or lack of appropriate bacterial chaperone proteins [4,5]. Several strategies are commonly employed to reduce inclusion bodies: a) controlling the rate of protein synthesis, b) enabling secretion into the periplasm, and c) co-expression of chaperone genes. The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [6]. The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing [1,5,7,8,9,10], although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm [11,12]. The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins [13,14,15,16]. Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins [17,18,19]. Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

Natural molecular chaperone systems have been used to solubilize various recombinant proteins with limited success. Here, we attempted to facilitate chaperone-mediated folding by directing the molecular chaperones to their protein substrates before the co-translational folding process completed. To achieve this, we either anchored the bacterial chaperone DnaJ to the 3\u02b9 untranslated region of a target mRNA by fusing with an RNA-binding domain in the chaperone-recruiting mRNA scaffold (CRAS) system, or coupled the expression of DnaJ and a target recombinant protein using the overlapping stop-start codons 5\u02b9-TAATG-3\u02b9 between the two genes in a chaperone-substrate co-localized expression (CLEX) system. By engineering the untranslated and intergenic sequences of the mRNA transcript, bacterial molecular chaperones are spatially constrained to the location of protein translation, expressing selected aggregation-prone proteins in their functionally active, soluble form. Our mRNA engineering methods surpassed the in-vivo solubilization efficiency of the simple DnaJ chaperone co-overexpression method, thus providing more effective tools for producing soluble therapeutic proteins and enzymes.",

                    "text": "Functional expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic hosts is of considerable industrial interest, with applications ranging from therapeutic proteins and recombinant enzyme production to metabolic engineering for synthesizing value-added biomolecules [1,2]. However, recombinant protein overexpression in prokaryotic hosts commonly results in protein aggregate formations, termed inclusion bodies [3], which far exceed the host folding capacity. Accordingly, costly and time-consuming in-vitro refolding processes have been widely applied to recover functionally active proteins in their soluble forms. Furthermore, inclusion body formation is generally harmful to the host through increased cellular metabolic burden and intermolecular interactions with other cellular components [4,5], reducing cell viability and overall production yield. \n\nIn vivo and in vitro strategies to solubilize recombinant proteins to an active conformation during the initial production process [6] include solubility-enhancing tags to intrinsically prevent misfolded protein formation in-vivo [7][8][9], physicochemical condition modification to balance translational and folding processes [10,11], and molecular chaperone overexpression to improve host disaggregation and folding capacity [12][13][14]. Molecular chaperones, which can assist cells in coping with stress-induced protein denaturation [15,16], constitute powerful tools to produce functionally active and water-soluble recombinant proteins. Among the options, the use of molecular chaperones is more cost-effective and less time-consuming as no post-translational processing and compromises in cell growth conditions are required. However, straightforward native chaperone co-overexpression with target proteins yields only limited solubilization during recombinant protein production. Although abundant molecular chaperones may be available through the chaperone co-expression approaches, these may not effectively diffuse through the crowded cytosol to interact in a timely fashion with a nascent polypeptide before the mis-foldings happen [17].",

M. Bui, A. Geraldi, Thi Thuy Nguyen, Jun Hyoung Lee, J. Y. Lee, Byung-Kwan Cho, S. C. Kim\n## Abstract\nThe production of soluble, functional recombinant proteins by engineered bacterial hosts is challenging. Natural molecular chaperone systems have been used to solubilize various recombinant proteins with limited success. Here, we attempted to facilitate chaperone-mediated folding by directing the molecular chaperones to their protein substrates before the co-translational folding process completed. To achieve this, we either anchored the bacterial chaperone DnaJ to the 3\u02b9 untranslated region of a target mRNA by fusing with an RNA-binding domain in the chaperone-recruiting mRNA scaffold (CRAS) system, or coupled the expression of DnaJ and a target recombinant protein using the overlapping stop-start codons 5\u02b9-TAATG-3\u02b9 between the two genes in a chaperone-substrate co-localized expression (CLEX) system. By engineering the untranslated and intergenic sequences of the mRNA transcript, bacterial molecular chaperones are spatially constrained to the location of protein translation, expressing selected aggregation-prone proteins in their functionally active, soluble form. Our mRNA engineering methods surpassed the in-vivo solubilization efficiency of the simple DnaJ chaperone co-overexpression method, thus providing more effective tools for producing soluble therapeutic proteins and enzymes.\n## Introduction\nFunctional expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic hosts is of considerable industrial interest, with applications ranging from therapeutic proteins and recombinant enzyme production to metabolic engineering for synthesizing value-added biomolecules [1,2]. However, recombinant protein overexpression in prokaryotic hosts commonly results in protein aggregate formations, termed inclusion bodies [3], which far exceed the host folding capacity. Accordingly, costly and time-consuming in-vitro refolding processes have been widely applied to recover functionally active proteins in their soluble forms. Furthermore, inclusion body formation is generally harmful to the host through increased cellular metabolic burden and intermolecular interactions with other cellular components [4,5], reducing cell viability and overall production yield. \n\nIn vivo and in vitro strategies to solubilize recombinant proteins to an active conformation during the initial production process [6] include solubility-enhancing tags to intrinsically prevent misfolded protein formation in-vivo [7][8][9], physicochemical condition modification to balance translational and folding processes [10,11], and molecular chaperone overexpression to improve host disaggregation and folding capacity [12][13][14]. Molecular chaperones, which can assist cells in coping with stress-induced protein denaturation [15,16], constitute powerful tools to produce functionally active and water-soluble recombinant proteins. Among the options, the use of molecular chaperones is more cost-effective and less time-consuming as no post-translational processing and compromises in cell growth conditions are required. However, straightforward native chaperone co-overexpression with target proteins yields only limited solubilization during recombinant protein production. Although abundant molecular chaperones may be available through the chaperone co-expression approaches, these may not effectively diffuse through the crowded cytosol to interact in a timely fashion with a nascent polypeptide before the mis-foldings happen [17].",

Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications.

As a result the host organism is often forced to produce proteins above the cells physiological capacity. Upon over-expression, a high amount of proteins are constantly formed that cannot be simultaneously processed by the protein synthesis machinery, thus the quality control system is activated [25]. Additionally, E. coli has simple protein folding machinery, which lacks post-translational modifications. Due to the reducing potential of the E. coli cytoplasmic redox state, the production of proteins possessing more disulfide bonds still remains a challenge. The combination of all these factors, together with the exceeded solubility of over-expressed recombinant protein leads to the aggregation of recombinant proteins, which often gives rise to IBs formation. \n\nIBs were for a long time understood as inert deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins in some way separated from the cellular repair mechanism. However, it is now known that protein aggregation into IBs is reversible [26] and dependent on the physiological state of the host organism. IBs are very dynamic structures that are continuously formed in the host cell and simultaneously the proteins are also released from them and refolded or degraded by the cell repair mechanisms [27]. \n\nSince protein aggregates represented an obstacle in recombinant protein production, various mechanisms that would enable production of soluble proteins in bacteria were studied. Yields of soluble protein expression can be increased by chaperone co-expression [28], fusion of target protein with suitable fusion tags [29], choosing appropriate host strain and promoter system or modifying the cultivation conditions (e.g., growth temperature, media composition) [17]. However, studies showed, that protein solubility does not imply protein activity, as large amount of the proteins found soluble in the cytoplasm can be biologically inactive [7,8]. \n\nThe formation of protein aggregates is a self-assembly process in bacterial cells. As there is no compartmentalization, proteins are simultaneously synthesized on multiple locations in the bacterial cytoplasm and various transitional folding states of the target protein are formed (Figure 1).",

Komel\n## Abstract\nSince recombinant proteins are widely used in industry and in research, the need for their low-cost production is increasing. Escherichia coli is one of the best known and most often used host organisms for economical protein production. However, upon over-expression, protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs) are often formed. Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications. Therefore interest in understanding the mechanisms of their formation as well as their properties is increasing.\n## Protein Aggregation and IBs Formation\nThe aim of recombinant protein production is to yield high amounts of the desired proteins. As a result the host organism is often forced to produce proteins above the cells physiological capacity. Upon over-expression, a high amount of proteins are constantly formed that cannot be simultaneously processed by the protein synthesis machinery, thus the quality control system is activated [25]. Additionally, E. coli has simple protein folding machinery, which lacks post-translational modifications. Due to the reducing potential of the E. coli cytoplasmic redox state, the production of proteins possessing more disulfide bonds still remains a challenge. The combination of all these factors, together with the exceeded solubility of over-expressed recombinant protein leads to the aggregation of recombinant proteins, which often gives rise to IBs formation. \n\nIBs were for a long time understood as inert deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins in some way separated from the cellular repair mechanism. However, it is now known that protein aggregation into IBs is reversible [26] and dependent on the physiological state of the host organism. IBs are very dynamic structures that are continuously formed in the host cell and simultaneously the proteins are also released from them and refolded or degraded by the cell repair mechanisms [27]. \n\nSince protein aggregates represented an obstacle in recombinant protein production, various mechanisms that would enable production of soluble proteins in bacteria were studied. Yields of soluble protein expression can be increased by chaperone co-expression [28], fusion of target protein with suitable fusion tags [29], choosing appropriate host strain and promoter system or modifying the cultivation conditions (e.g., growth temperature, media composition) [17]. However, studies showed, that protein solubility does not imply protein activity, as large amount of the proteins found soluble in the cytoplasm can be biologically inactive [7,8]. \n\nThe formation of protein aggregates is a self-assembly process in bacterial cells. As there is no compartmentalization, proteins are simultaneously synthesized on multiple locations in the bacterial cytoplasm and various transitional folding states of the target protein are formed (Figure 1).",

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology.",

                    "text": "Chaperones assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state and provide a quality control system that refolds misfolded and aggregated proteins. In the E. coli cytosol, the folding of newly synthesized proteins is assisted by the ribosome-associated Trigger Factor, the DnaK system (DnaK with its DnaJ and GrpE cochaperones; KJE), and the GroEL system (GroEL with its GroES cochaperone; ELS) [1][2][3][4]. KJE and ELS also prevent aggregation and promote refolding of preexisting proteins which lost their native conformation e.g. due to thermal denaturation or intrinsic instability [5,6]. KJE furthermore cooperates with ClpB to solubilize aggregated proteins and refold them to the native state in a concerted action with ELS [7][8][9]. Moreover, the small heat shock proteins (sHSP) of E. coli, IbpA and IbpB (IbpAB), intercalate into protein aggregates and thereby facilitate the KJE/ClpB dependent disaggregation and refolding [10][11][12]. \n\nThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation [13][14][15][16][17]. Folding problems of overproduced client proteins can be caused by limitations in the chaperone capacity of the host cells. Several attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded, and hence soluble, recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of individual chaperones in producing cells, however only with a limited success. For example, the co-overproduction of ELS increases the solubility of human ORP150, human lysozyme, p50 csk protein tyrosine kinase, phosphomannose isomerase and fusion protein PreS2-S'-\u03b2-galactosidase and maize protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase [18][19][20][21][22][23].",

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology.\n## Background\nChaperones assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state and provide a quality control system that refolds misfolded and aggregated proteins. In the E. coli cytosol, the folding of newly synthesized proteins is assisted by the ribosome-associated Trigger Factor, the DnaK system (DnaK with its DnaJ and GrpE cochaperones; KJE), and the GroEL system (GroEL with its GroES cochaperone; ELS) [1][2][3][4]. KJE and ELS also prevent aggregation and promote refolding of preexisting proteins which lost their native conformation e.g. due to thermal denaturation or intrinsic instability [5,6]. KJE furthermore cooperates with ClpB to solubilize aggregated proteins and refold them to the native state in a concerted action with ELS [7][8][9]. Moreover, the small heat shock proteins (sHSP) of E. coli, IbpA and IbpB (IbpAB), intercalate into protein aggregates and thereby facilitate the KJE/ClpB dependent disaggregation and refolding [10][11][12]. \n\nThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation [13][14][15][16][17]. Folding problems of overproduced client proteins can be caused by limitations in the chaperone capacity of the host cells. Several attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded, and hence soluble, recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of individual chaperones in producing cells, however only with a limited success. For example, the co-overproduction of ELS increases the solubility of human ORP150, human lysozyme, p50 csk protein tyrosine kinase, phosphomannose isomerase and fusion protein PreS2-S'-\u03b2-galactosidase and maize protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase [18][19][20][21][22][23].",

Hydrophobic interactions between partially folded amphiphillic and hydrophobic alpha-helices were found to be one of the main determinants of hGH inclusion body formation. Aggregation behavior of the protein molecules decides the nature and properties of inclusion bodies.\n",

However, overexpression of recombinant protein in E. coli often found as inclusion bodies. While formation of inclusion bodies is beneficial in protein isolation from other cellular components, most of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies are misfolded which have lost their biological activity. Protein refolding allows misfolded protein to rearrange into their native conformation which exhibit its biological activity, thus protein refolding become a pivotal step to recover active protein. However, protein refolding was affected by various factors; hence, screening of refolding condition was required to meet the optimal result. As a consequence, rapid and efficient characterization method is required to monitor the refolding performance. In this review, we will briefly give an overview about protein refolding method, chemical additives in protein refolding, and also provide insight in structural characterization to evaluate refolding performance.",

The method for protein refolding is vary, such as dilution, dialysis, chromatography-based method, usage of immobilization folding catalyst, and artificial chaperones, and also enzyme-assisted refolding is among the available methods which offer different and unique advantages and disadvantages. Chemical additives also play role to improve the refolding process. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield, while oxo-shuffling agents such as GSH/GSSG, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT sometimes used to promote disulfide shuffling to obtain proper disulfide bridge pairs.

Maksum\n## Abstract\nAmong bacterial expression system, Escherichia coli was the popular and widely used expression host due to its high rate expression trait. However, overexpression of recombinant protein in E. coli often found as inclusion bodies. While formation of inclusion bodies is beneficial in protein isolation from other cellular components, most of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies are misfolded which have lost their biological activity. Protein refolding allows misfolded protein to rearrange into their native conformation which exhibit its biological activity, thus protein refolding become a pivotal step to recover active protein. However, protein refolding was affected by various factors; hence, screening of refolding condition was required to meet the optimal result. As a consequence, rapid and efficient characterization method is required to monitor the refolding performance. In this review, we will briefly give an overview about protein refolding method, chemical additives in protein refolding, and also provide insight in structural characterization to evaluate refolding performance.\n## CONCLUSION\nExpression of recombinant protein in E. coli is favored due to its high-yield product. However, its nature to form inclusion bodies during the process becomes a challenge, since inclusion bodies are mostly biologically inactive. Solubilizing the insoluble inclusion bodies and further refolding processes are required to obtain an active protein. The method for protein refolding is vary, such as dilution, dialysis, chromatography-based method, usage of immobilization folding catalyst, and artificial chaperones, and also enzyme-assisted refolding is among the available methods which offer different and unique advantages and disadvantages. Chemical additives also play role to improve the refolding process. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield. Amino acid and polyols oftenly added to prevent protein aggregation, thus improving the soluble protein yield, while oxo-shuffling agents such as GSH/GSSG, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT sometimes used to promote disulfide shuffling to obtain proper disulfide bridge pairs. Monitoring the refolding process was conducted by characterizing the protein structure. However, performing a rapid and accurate characterization sometimes become a challenge, in fact, both criteria are occasionally exchanging each other. Therefore, in this review, we briefly discussed protein refolding along with its structural characterization method.",

In this expression system, induction of heterologous protein is achieved by increasing the culture temperature, generally above 37\u00b0C. Concomitant to the overexpression of heterologous protein, the increase in temperature also causes a variety of complex stress responses. Many studies have reported the use of such temperature inducible expression system, however only few discuss the simultaneous stress effects caused by recombinant protein production and the up-shift in temperature. Understanding the integral effect of such responses should be useful to develop improved strategies for high yield protein production and recovery. Here, we describe the current status of the heat inducible expression system based on the pL and/or pR \u03bb phage promoters, focusing on recent developments on expression vehicles, the stress responses at the molecular and physiological level that occur after heat induction, and bioprocessing factors that affect protein overexpression, including culture operation variables and induction strategies.",

Until now, few examples of soluble recombinant protein expression in periplasm using the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system have been reported [125,142]. \n\nThe increased temperature and high production rates alter protein folding, which in turn favors protein aggregation into inclusion bodies (IB) when using the \u03bbpL/ pR-cI857 system [65,137,149,150]. The factors that determine IB formation include the nature of the protein expressed (v. gr., protein sequence), growth and induction conditions, cytoplasmic reducing environment, kinetic competition between aggregation and folding, high local protein concentration, inappropriate interactions with in vivo folding chaperones, intermolecular disulfide crosslinking (although proteins lacking cysteines can still form inclusion bodies), medium composition, and bacterial strain [137,[150][151][152][153]. Accumulation of the recombinant protein in IB has certain advantages, as it can be isolated and concentrated by a simple centrifugation step, reducing the downstream processing costs and facilitating the production of toxic proteins to cells [154][155][156].",

                    "text": "Interestingly, the absence of DnaK and GroEL in E. coli mutants significantly reduces bacterial growth [161]. Absence of DnaK results in larger IB, whereas a deficiency of GroEL reduces aggregation and favors soluble protein formation, with the concomitant production of smaller and numerous IB [155]. This has been explained as a combined consequence of a less efficient folding and impaired rescue (removal) of aggregates [161]. \n\nInterestingly, expression systems that are not based on heat induction have exploited phenomena present in the heat inducible expression system to improve various aspects of recombinant protein production. For instance, chaperones like DnaK/J or DnaK/J-GrpE/ClpB have been co-expressed to facilitate disaggregation and refolding of the recombinant protein of interest [162,163]. Likewise, the co-expression of GroEL/S with heterologous proteins such as zeta-crystallin [164] and carbamoylase [165] has significantly enhanced the yield of soluble proteins. Other examples include the co-expression of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones to increase the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, or the overexpression of DnaJ to increase soluble transglutaminase content [166,167]. Overexpression of all such chaperons naturally occurs during thermoinduction of heterologous protein. Accordingly, the knowledge gained on the molecular and physiological events that occur during recombinant protein production by the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system can be of great value to control and improve not only this expression system but others as well.",

A. Valdez-Cruz, Luis Caspeta, N. P\u00e9rez, O. Ram\u00edrez, M. Trujillo-Rold\u00e1n\n## Abstract\nThe temperature inducible expression system, based on the pL and/or pR phage lambda promoters regulated by the thermolabile cI857 repressor has been widely use to produce recombinant proteins in prokariotic cells. In this expression system, induction of heterologous protein is achieved by increasing the culture temperature, generally above 37\u00b0C. Concomitant to the overexpression of heterologous protein, the increase in temperature also causes a variety of complex stress responses. Many studies have reported the use of such temperature inducible expression system, however only few discuss the simultaneous stress effects caused by recombinant protein production and the up-shift in temperature. Understanding the integral effect of such responses should be useful to develop improved strategies for high yield protein production and recovery. Here, we describe the current status of the heat inducible expression system based on the pL and/or pR \u03bb phage promoters, focusing on recent developments on expression vehicles, the stress responses at the molecular and physiological level that occur after heat induction, and bioprocessing factors that affect protein overexpression, including culture operation variables and induction strategies.\n## Protein accumulation and recovery\nRecombinant proteins produced in the thermoinduced \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 expression system can form aggregates in the cytoplasm, accumulate in soluble form either in the cytoplasm or the periplasmic space, or be secreted to the supernatant [7,65,125,149]. The site of protein accumulation depends on proper localization signals [125]. Production of recombinant proteins in the periplasmic space offers several advantages, such as decreased proteolytic activity compared to the cytoplasm, simpler purification protocols as fewer host proteins are present in the periplasm, and minimum amounts or even absence of undesirable isoforms and posttranscriptional modifications. Furthermore, the in vivo cleavage of the signal peptide provides authentic N-terminus of the target protein without an extra methionine). Another advantage is that correct formation of disulfide bonds can be facilitated because the periplasmic space provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm [14,125]. Until now, few examples of soluble recombinant protein expression in periplasm using the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system have been reported [125,142]. \n\nThe increased temperature and high production rates alter protein folding, which in turn favors protein aggregation into inclusion bodies (IB) when using the \u03bbpL/ pR-cI857 system [65,137,149,150]. The factors that determine IB formation include the nature of the protein expressed (v. gr., protein sequence), growth and induction conditions, cytoplasmic reducing environment, kinetic competition between aggregation and folding, high local protein concentration, inappropriate interactions with in vivo folding chaperones, intermolecular disulfide crosslinking (although proteins lacking cysteines can still form inclusion bodies), medium composition, and bacterial strain [137,[150][151][152][153]. Accumulation of the recombinant protein in IB has certain advantages, as it can be isolated and concentrated by a simple centrifugation step, reducing the downstream processing costs and facilitating the production of toxic proteins to cells [154][155][156].\n...\nInterestingly, the absence of DnaK and GroEL in E. coli mutants significantly reduces bacterial growth [161]. Absence of DnaK results in larger IB, whereas a deficiency of GroEL reduces aggregation and favors soluble protein formation, with the concomitant production of smaller and numerous IB [155]. This has been explained as a combined consequence of a less efficient folding and impaired rescue (removal) of aggregates [161]. \n\nInterestingly, expression systems that are not based on heat induction have exploited phenomena present in the heat inducible expression system to improve various aspects of recombinant protein production. For instance, chaperones like DnaK/J or DnaK/J-GrpE/ClpB have been co-expressed to facilitate disaggregation and refolding of the recombinant protein of interest [162,163]. Likewise, the co-expression of GroEL/S with heterologous proteins such as zeta-crystallin [164] and carbamoylase [165] has significantly enhanced the yield of soluble proteins. Other examples include the co-expression of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones to increase the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, or the overexpression of DnaJ to increase soluble transglutaminase content [166,167]. Overexpression of all such chaperons naturally occurs during thermoinduction of heterologous protein. Accordingly, the knowledge gained on the molecular and physiological events that occur during recombinant protein production by the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system can be of great value to control and improve not only this expression system but others as well.",

This is unfavorable, as incomplete or incorrect folding can inhibit both the formation of conformational epitopes and the exposure of linear epitopes [79]. Two strategies can be employed to circumvent this issue: \n\n(1) taking steps to prevent the formation of aggregates or (2) solubilization and refolding of target proteins from inclusion bodies in vitro. \n\nOften, the challenge of achieving native protein conformations increases with the number of cysteine residues due to the various possible isoforms and complexity of disulfide bond patterns [80]. The correct folding of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in E. coli systems is limited by the reducing cytoplasmic environment maintained by several cellular components, including the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which are effective in reducing disulfide bonds back to free thiols [81]. One approach to mitigate this issue focuses on using strains engineered to promote an oxidative environment in the cytoplasm by knocking out thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin reductase (encoded by the genes trxB and gor, respectively) [82]. These \u2206gor \u2206trxB strains can be purchased commercially under the names Origami, Rosetta-gami (Novagen) or SHuffle (New England Biolabs). The SHuffle system additionally produces DsbC in the cytoplasm, which acts as a catalyst for disulfide bond isomerization [83]. Interestingly, Nguyen et al. [83] reported the production of eukaryotic proteins containing disulfide bonds in bacterial cells without disrupting the reducing pathways. The authors state that the co-expression of a sulfhydryl oxidase and a disulfide isomerase, catalysts of S-S bond formation, allows for the correct folding of proteins in the cytoplasm.",

This review provides an overview of the methods and strategies employed for the production of recombinant Toxoplasma gondii antigenic proteins for the serological detection of T. gondii infection and vaccine development.\n## Protein Solubility\nThe overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli can result in their aggregation into insoluble inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm [78]. This is unfavorable, as incomplete or incorrect folding can inhibit both the formation of conformational epitopes and the exposure of linear epitopes [79]. Two strategies can be employed to circumvent this issue: \n\n(1) taking steps to prevent the formation of aggregates or (2) solubilization and refolding of target proteins from inclusion bodies in vitro. \n\nOften, the challenge of achieving native protein conformations increases with the number of cysteine residues due to the various possible isoforms and complexity of disulfide bond patterns [80]. The correct folding of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in E. coli systems is limited by the reducing cytoplasmic environment maintained by several cellular components, including the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which are effective in reducing disulfide bonds back to free thiols [81]. One approach to mitigate this issue focuses on using strains engineered to promote an oxidative environment in the cytoplasm by knocking out thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin reductase (encoded by the genes trxB and gor, respectively) [82]. These \u2206gor \u2206trxB strains can be purchased commercially under the names Origami, Rosetta-gami (Novagen) or SHuffle (New England Biolabs). The SHuffle system additionally produces DsbC in the cytoplasm, which acts as a catalyst for disulfide bond isomerization [83]. Interestingly, Nguyen et al. [83] reported the production of eukaryotic proteins containing disulfide bonds in bacterial cells without disrupting the reducing pathways. The authors state that the co-expression of a sulfhydryl oxidase and a disulfide isomerase, catalysts of S-S bond formation, allows for the correct folding of proteins in the cytoplasm.",

Recombinant proteins are obtained mainly through microbial fermentation, with Escherichia coli being the host most used. In spite of that, some problems are associated with the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, such as the formation of inclusion bodies, the metabolic burden, or the inefficient translocation/transport system of expressed proteins. Optimizing transcription of heterologous genes is essential to avoid these drawbacks and develop competitive biotechnological processes. Here, expression of YFP reporter protein is evaluated under the control of four promoters of different strength (PT7lac, Ptrc, Ptac, and PBAD) and two different replication origins (high copy number pMB1\u2032 and low copy number p15A). In addition, the study has been carried out with the E. coli BL21 wt and the ackA mutant strain growing in a rich medium with glucose or glycerol as carbon sources. Results showed that metabolic burden associated with transcription and translation of foreign genes involves a decrease in recombinant protein expression. It is necessary to find a balance between plasmid copy number and promoter strength to maximize soluble recombinant protein expression. The results obtained represent an important advance on the most suitable expression system to improve both the quantity and quality of recombinant proteins in bioproduction engineering.",

Recombinant protein precipitation involves, in addition to a decrease in the yield of the production process, an alteration in the gene transcription of the strain (Baig et al., 2014). Hence, to optimize a large-scale recombinant protein production process, it is essential to know what proportion of the protein forms precipitates and what fraction remains in soluble form, and therefore functional for most subsequent applications. In order to know the percentage of soluble and insoluble YFP protein, batch cultures were carried out with E. coli growing under the conditions corresponding to the maximum expression observed for each vector (Figure 5). When cultures reached the stationary phase, soluble/insoluble fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometric analysis. Electrophoresis gels are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Figure 5 results showed that insoluble YFP protein was present in all cultures. However, cultures where YFP was expressed under P BAD promoter control showed lower insoluble fraction. Moreover, cultures containing pSF-p15A-trc-YFP and pSF-p15A-tac-YFP vectors, of which YFP expression was the highest, showed a similar percentage of soluble and insoluble protein. This difference observed in the amount of protein precipitated according to the expression plasmid used is very relevant, since it is useless to achieve a high expression if most of the protein is precipitated together with the cell pellet. Therefore, this aspect should be studied previously when selecting an expression system, especially if we are faced with a protein with limited solubility.",

Here, expression of YFP reporter protein is evaluated under the control of four promoters of different strength (PT7lac, Ptrc, Ptac, and PBAD) and two different replication origins (high copy number pMB1\u2032 and low copy number p15A). In addition, the study has been carried out with the E. coli BL21 wt and the ackA mutant strain growing in a rich medium with glucose or glycerol as carbon sources. Results showed that metabolic burden associated with transcription and translation of foreign genes involves a decrease in recombinant protein expression. It is necessary to find a balance between plasmid copy number and promoter strength to maximize soluble recombinant protein expression. The results obtained represent an important advance on the most suitable expression system to improve both the quantity and quality of recombinant proteins in bioproduction engineering.\n## Study of Recombinant Yellow Fluorescent Protein Protein Solubility\nOne of the greatest drawbacks to obtain high recombinant protein yields with E. coli is the formation of inclusion bodies and protein precipitation, due to high expression, incorrect folding, aggregation, or low chaperone activity (Gopal and Kumar, 2013). Recombinant protein precipitation involves, in addition to a decrease in the yield of the production process, an alteration in the gene transcription of the strain (Baig et al., 2014). Hence, to optimize a large-scale recombinant protein production process, it is essential to know what proportion of the protein forms precipitates and what fraction remains in soluble form, and therefore functional for most subsequent applications. In order to know the percentage of soluble and insoluble YFP protein, batch cultures were carried out with E. coli growing under the conditions corresponding to the maximum expression observed for each vector (Figure 5). When cultures reached the stationary phase, soluble/insoluble fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometric analysis. Electrophoresis gels are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Figure 5 results showed that insoluble YFP protein was present in all cultures. However, cultures where YFP was expressed under P BAD promoter control showed lower insoluble fraction. Moreover, cultures containing pSF-p15A-trc-YFP and pSF-p15A-tac-YFP vectors, of which YFP expression was the highest, showed a similar percentage of soluble and insoluble protein. This difference observed in the amount of protein precipitated according to the expression plasmid used is very relevant, since it is useless to achieve a high expression if most of the protein is precipitated together with the cell pellet. Therefore, this aspect should be studied previously when selecting an expression system, especially if we are faced with a protein with limited solubility.",

The optimal expression level must be neither too low, which would limit yields, nor too high, which would promote the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Expression can be optimized by testing different combinations of elements such as ribosome binding sites and N-terminal affinity tags, but the rate of protein synthesis is strongly dependent on mRNA secondary structures so the combined effects of these elements must be taken into account. This substantially increases the complexity of high-throughput expression screening. To address this limitation, we generated libraries of constructs systematically combining different ribosome binding sites, N-terminal affinity tags, and periplasmic translocation sequences representing two secretion pathways. Each construct also contained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to allow the identification of high producers and a thrombin cleavage site enabling the removal of fusion tags. To achieve proof of principle, we generated libraries of 200 different combinations of elements for the expression of an antimicrobial peptide (AMPs), an antifungal peptide, and the enzyme urate oxidase (uricase) in Escherichia coli and Vibrio natriegens. High producers for all three difficult-to-express products were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Our results indicated that the E. coli ssYahJ secretion signal is recognized in V. natriegens and efficiently mediates translocation to the periplasm. Our combinatorial library approach therefore allows the cross-species direct selection of high-producer clones for difficult-to-express proteins by systematically evaluating the combined impact of multiple construct elements.",

Although, many recombinant proteins are strongly expressed with short production times and can be recovered as soluble products, others are difficult to express either because they are toxic to the host, resulting in low yields, or because they form insoluble inclusion bodies due to incomplete or incorrect folding (Carri\u00f3 and Villaverde, 2002;Sa\u00efda, 2007). These challenges are often encountered when expressing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), many of which require the formation of disulfide bonds for efficient folding and biological activity. In some cases inclusion bodies are produced deliberately, but the purification and refolding of insoluble proteins requires elaborate downstream processing and often limits the yield and functionality of the product (Hoffmann et al., 2018). \n\nThe folding of recombinant proteins in bacteria can also be improved by targeting the periplasm, a space between the outer and inner membrane that contains more chaperones than the cytoplasm, thus promoting folding and resulting in higher yields and less complex downstream processing steps. The oxidizing environment of the periplasm also favors the formation of disulfide bonds (Choi and Lee, 2004;Balasundaram et al., 2009). Translocation of proteins to the periplasm has been a subject to research since the very beginnings of recombinant protein expression technology (Gray et al., 1985;Oliveira et al., 1999). There are two major protein secretion pathways in bacteria. The general secretory (Sec) pathway exports unfolded proteins during or after translation (Tsirigotaki et al., 2017) whereas the twinarginine translocation (Tat) pathway exports folded proteins. Secretion to the periplasm is achieved by adding an N-terminal signal peptide, which is cleaved off during translocation (Berks et al., 2000).",

Oberpaul, T. Weidner, Doreen Gerlach, P. Czermak\n## Abstract\nThe optimization of recombinant protein production in bacteria is an important stage of process development, especially for difficult-to-express proteins that are particularly sensitive or recalcitrant. The optimal expression level must be neither too low, which would limit yields, nor too high, which would promote the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Expression can be optimized by testing different combinations of elements such as ribosome binding sites and N-terminal affinity tags, but the rate of protein synthesis is strongly dependent on mRNA secondary structures so the combined effects of these elements must be taken into account. This substantially increases the complexity of high-throughput expression screening. To address this limitation, we generated libraries of constructs systematically combining different ribosome binding sites, N-terminal affinity tags, and periplasmic translocation sequences representing two secretion pathways. Each construct also contained a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to allow the identification of high producers and a thrombin cleavage site enabling the removal of fusion tags. To achieve proof of principle, we generated libraries of 200 different combinations of elements for the expression of an antimicrobial peptide (AMPs), an antifungal peptide, and the enzyme urate oxidase (uricase) in Escherichia coli and Vibrio natriegens. High producers for all three difficult-to-express products were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Our results indicated that the E. coli ssYahJ secretion signal is recognized in V. natriegens and efficiently mediates translocation to the periplasm. Our combinatorial library approach therefore allows the cross-species direct selection of high-producer clones for difficult-to-express proteins by systematically evaluating the combined impact of multiple construct elements.\n## INTRODUCTION\nEscherichia coli is one of the most common production hosts for recombinant proteins and many expression construct components are available to improve yields and facilitate protein recovery, including a variety of promoters and fusion proteins (Moore et al., 2016;Schreiber et al., 2017). Although, many recombinant proteins are strongly expressed with short production times and can be recovered as soluble products, others are difficult to express either because they are toxic to the host, resulting in low yields, or because they form insoluble inclusion bodies due to incomplete or incorrect folding (Carri\u00f3 and Villaverde, 2002;Sa\u00efda, 2007). These challenges are often encountered when expressing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), many of which require the formation of disulfide bonds for efficient folding and biological activity. In some cases inclusion bodies are produced deliberately, but the purification and refolding of insoluble proteins requires elaborate downstream processing and often limits the yield and functionality of the product (Hoffmann et al., 2018). \n\nThe folding of recombinant proteins in bacteria can also be improved by targeting the periplasm, a space between the outer and inner membrane that contains more chaperones than the cytoplasm, thus promoting folding and resulting in higher yields and less complex downstream processing steps. The oxidizing environment of the periplasm also favors the formation of disulfide bonds (Choi and Lee, 2004;Balasundaram et al., 2009). Translocation of proteins to the periplasm has been a subject to research since the very beginnings of recombinant protein expression technology (Gray et al., 1985;Oliveira et al., 1999). There are two major protein secretion pathways in bacteria. The general secretory (Sec) pathway exports unfolded proteins during or after translation (Tsirigotaki et al., 2017) whereas the twinarginine translocation (Tat) pathway exports folded proteins. Secretion to the periplasm is achieved by adding an N-terminal signal peptide, which is cleaved off during translocation (Berks et al., 2000).",

The divergence in the reported data could be due, at least partially, to different experimental conditions in independent research approaches.ResultsWe have then selected two structurally different model proteins (namely GFP and E. coli \u03b2-galactosidase) and two derived aggregation-prone fusions to explore, in a systematic way, the eventual effects of GroELS co-production on yield, solubility and conformational quality. Host cells were cultured at two alternative temperatures below the threshold at which thermal stress is expected to be triggered, to minimize the involvement of independent stress factors.ConclusionsFrom the analysis of protein yield, solubility and biological activity of the four model proteins produced alone or along the chaperones, we conclude that GroELS impacts on yield and quality of aggregation-prone proteins with intrinsic determinants but not on thermally induced protein aggregation. No effective modifications of protein solubility have been observed, but significant stabilization of small (encapsulable) substrates and moderate chaperone-induced degradation of larger (excluded) polypeptides. These findings indicate that the activities of this chaperone pair in the context of actively producing recombinant bacteria discriminate between intrinsic and thermally-induced protein aggregation, and that the side effects of GroELS overproduction might be determined by substrate size.",

Protein misfolding, degradation, aggregation, inclusion body formation and low functional protein quality are among the main obstacles encountered when using conventional bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli [2][3][4] as cell factories, these events being specially distressing when proteins are intended for therapeutic uses [5,6].\n\nApart from shifting to a growing number of alternative hosts, what might eventually improve protein yield and quality, several strategies have been implemented to favour recombinant protein yield and quality in bacteria, specially addressed to enhance proteolytic stability and minimize aggregation [3,7]. As the activities of the cell's quality control were identified ( [8], and references therein), the co-production of chaperones along with the target protein was taken as a routine approach. Firstly individual chaperones, and later chaperone-cochaperone pairs or larger chaperone sets, supplied from additional plasmid vectors, have been assayed as folding modulators under different experimental setting ups and for a large catalogue of proteins [9]. Despite reports of 1 Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article relevant successes, a consensus about final doses and composition of the best chaperone catalogue has not been reached, as the positive effects of this strategy seem to be highly dependent, among other potential factors, on the specific recombinant protein. In addition, externally supplied chaperones might show side effects on the whole physiology of recombinant cells and eventually compromise the quality, solubility or yield of the target recombinant protein [10,11]. Such undesired effects might limit the success of this method, and their occurrence can account, at least partially, for the lack of consistency of chaperone co-production as a generic strategy.\n\nDnaK, a key negative regulator of the quality control system and the main cytosolic E. coli chaperone (acting together with its co-chaperone DnaJ) is a common component of the most successful chaper",

Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Carmona, E. Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s, O. Cano-Garrido, A. Villaverde\n## Abstract\nBackgroundThe effects and effectiveness of the chaperone pair GroELS on the yield and quality of recombinant polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli are matter of controversy, as the reported activities of this complex are not always consistent and eventually indicate undesired side effects. The divergence in the reported data could be due, at least partially, to different experimental conditions in independent research approaches.ResultsWe have then selected two structurally different model proteins (namely GFP and E. coli \u03b2-galactosidase) and two derived aggregation-prone fusions to explore, in a systematic way, the eventual effects of GroELS co-production on yield, solubility and conformational quality. Host cells were cultured at two alternative temperatures below the threshold at which thermal stress is expected to be triggered, to minimize the involvement of independent stress factors.ConclusionsFrom the analysis of protein yield, solubility and biological activity of the four model proteins produced alone or along the chaperones, we conclude that GroELS impacts on yield and quality of aggregation-prone proteins with intrinsic determinants but not on thermally induced protein aggregation. No effective modifications of protein solubility have been observed, but significant stabilization of small (encapsulable) substrates and moderate chaperone-induced degradation of larger (excluded) polypeptides. These findings indicate that the activities of this chaperone pair in the context of actively producing recombinant bacteria discriminate between intrinsic and thermally-induced protein aggregation, and that the side effects of GroELS overproduction might be determined by substrate size.\n## Introduction\nRecombinant protein production is a leading methodological platform of biotechnology and biomedicine [1]. Protein misfolding, degradation, aggregation, inclusion body formation and low functional protein quality are among the main obstacles encountered when using conventional bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli [2][3][4] as cell factories, these events being specially distressing when proteins are intended for therapeutic uses [5,6].\n\nApart from shifting to a growing number of alternative hosts, what might eventually improve protein yield and quality, several strategies have been implemented to favour recombinant protein yield and quality in bacteria, specially addressed to enhance proteolytic stability and minimize aggregation [3,7]. As the activities of the cell's quality control were identified ( [8], and references therein), the co-production of chaperones along with the target protein was taken as a routine approach. Firstly individual chaperones, and later chaperone-cochaperone pairs or larger chaperone sets, supplied from additional plasmid vectors, have been assayed as folding modulators under different experimental setting ups and for a large catalogue of proteins [9]. Despite reports of 1 Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article relevant successes, a consensus about final doses and composition of the best chaperone catalogue has not been reached, as the positive effects of this strategy seem to be highly dependent, among other potential factors, on the specific recombinant protein. In addition, externally supplied chaperones might show side effects on the whole physiology of recombinant cells and eventually compromise the quality, solubility or yield of the target recombinant protein [10,11]. Such undesired effects might limit the success of this method, and their occurrence can account, at least partially, for the lack of consistency of chaperone co-production as a generic strategy.\n\nDnaK, a key negative regulator of the quality control system and the main cytosolic E. coli chaperone (acting together with its co-chaperone DnaJ) is a common component of the most successful chaper",

            "abstract": "BackgroundRecombinant protein production is a useful biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli (E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of vectors and proteins result in no expression.ResultsIn this study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant protein production core facility, where six different vectors were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.ConclusionIn this paper, we show that a machine learning approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a target protein in a recombinant protein production system is promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other labs in the public domain when this paper is published.",

These over-expressed proteins in an insoluble form are termed as inclusion bodies. Since the refolding procedure of inclusion bodies to recover a soluble form of recombinant proteins is time-consuming, expression of insoluble protein aggregates is frequently a major obstacle in recombinant protein production.\n\nHence, to meet the demands of preventing inclusion body formation in recombinant expression systems, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to optimize the growth conditions, such as buffer composition, protein concentration, and cultivation temperature. While others have focused on improving the folding probabilities regarding enhancement of mRNA stability, over-expression of rare-codon tRNA, selection of efficient vectors and host strains, and co-expression with solubility-enhanced proteins [3]. Nevertheless, more studies have emphasized the importance of increasing the solubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli by fusing them to highly soluble carrier proteins [9][10][11][12]. Because the only way to select a specific match between a target protein and an appropriate fusion partner that will lead to a soluble form is still a trial-anderror process; a more systematic approach is required.\n\nRegardless of fusing different vectors, most previous works have attempted to predict the propensity of a given protein to be soluble or not in E. coli. The first such study was conducted by Wilkinson and Harrison [13] with a regression model analysis. They concluded five amino acid-dependent factors are discriminative features that correlate to inclusion bodies formation. There were charge average approximation (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg), turn-forming residue fraction (Asn, Gly, Pro and Ser), cysteine and proline fractions, hydrophilicity and molecular weight. In a subsequent study, Davis et al. have improved the statistical solubility model of solubility in E. coli by demonstrating that the first two parameters were more critical than other three [14]. Additionally, based on the undertaking of structural genomics projects, Bertone et al. have applied machine learning techniques such as decision trees and Support",

Liang, Yan-Ping Shih, Ueng-Cheng Yang, Wen-chang Lin, Chun-Nan Hsu\n## Abstract\nBackgroundRecombinant protein production is a useful biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli (E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of vectors and proteins result in no expression.ResultsIn this study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant protein production core facility, where six different vectors were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.ConclusionIn this paper, we show that a machine learning approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a target protein in a recombinant protein production system is promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other labs in the public domain when this paper is published.\n## body\nof foreign heterologous proteins were expressed at relatively low levels [7] or difficult to solubilize [8], in E. coli. These over-expressed proteins in an insoluble form are termed as inclusion bodies. Since the refolding procedure of inclusion bodies to recover a soluble form of recombinant proteins is time-consuming, expression of insoluble protein aggregates is frequently a major obstacle in recombinant protein production.\n\nHence, to meet the demands of preventing inclusion body formation in recombinant expression systems, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to optimize the growth conditions, such as buffer composition, protein concentration, and cultivation temperature. While others have focused on improving the folding probabilities regarding enhancement of mRNA stability, over-expression of rare-codon tRNA, selection of efficient vectors and host strains, and co-expression with solubility-enhanced proteins [3]. Nevertheless, more studies have emphasized the importance of increasing the solubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli by fusing them to highly soluble carrier proteins [9][10][11][12]. Because the only way to select a specific match between a target protein and an appropriate fusion partner that will lead to a soluble form is still a trial-anderror process; a more systematic approach is required.\n\nRegardless of fusing different vectors, most previous works have attempted to predict the propensity of a given protein to be soluble or not in E. coli. The first such study was conducted by Wilkinson and Harrison [13] with a regression model analysis. They concluded five amino acid-dependent factors are discriminative features that correlate to inclusion bodies formation. There were charge average approximation (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg), turn-forming residue fraction (Asn, Gly, Pro and Ser), cysteine and proline fractions, hydrophilicity and molecular weight. In a subsequent study, Davis et al. have improved the statistical solubility model of solubility in E. coli by demonstrating that the first two parameters were more critical than other three [14]. Additionally, based on the undertaking of structural genomics projects, Bertone et al. have applied machine learning techniques such as decision trees and Support",

Interestingly, when plasmid-harboring cells were cultured in LB medium, gluconeogenesis occurred mainly through MaeB, while in the host strain, gluconeogenesis occurred by a different pathway (by Mdh and PckA). Significant up-regulation of the chaperones ClpB, HslU and GroEL and high-level expression of two protective small heat shock proteins (IbpA and IbpB) were found in cells overexpressing GST-GlcNAc 2-epimerase-5D but not in GST-Neu5Ac aldolase-5R-expressing E. coli. Although most of the recombinant protein was present in insoluble aggregates, the soluble fraction of GST-GlcNAc 2-epimerase-5D was higher than that of GST-Neu5Ac aldolase-5R. Also, in cells overexpressing recombinant GST-GlcNAc 2-epimerase-5D, the expression of \u03c332 was maintained at a higher level following induction.ConclusionsDifferential expression of metabolically functional proteins, especially those in the gluconeogenesis pathway, was found between host and recombinant cells. Also, the expression patterns of chaperones/heat shock proteins differed among the plasmid-harboring bacteria in response to overproduction of recombinant proteins.

However, the formation of inclusion bodies during prokaryotic VP6 expression poses a significant hurdle to rotavirus research and applications. Here, we employed experimental and computational approaches to investigate inclusion body formation and aggregation-prone regions (APRs). Heterologous recombinant VP6 expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells resulted in inclusion body formation, confirmed by transmission electron microscopy revealing amorphous aggregates. Thioflavin T assay demonstrated incubation temperature-dependent aggregation of VP6 inclusion bodies. Computational predictions of APRs in rotavirus A VP6 protein were performed using sequence-based tools (TANGO, AGGRESCAN, Zyggregator, Waltz, FoldAmyloid, ANuPP, Camsol intrinsic) and structure-based tools (SolubiS, CamSol structurally corrected, Aggrescan3D). A total of 24 consensus APRs were identified, with 21 of them being surface-exposed in VP6. All identified APRs display a predominance of hydrophobic amino acids, ranging from 33 to 100%. Computational identification of these APRs corroborates our experimental observation of VP6 inclusion body or aggregate formation. Characterization of VP6's aggregation propensity facilitates understanding of its behaviour during prokaryotic expression and opens avenues for protein engineering of soluble variants, advancing research on rotavirus VP6 in pathology, therapy, and diagnostics.",

Subsequent protein extraction and solubility analysis revealed an abundant presence of the recombinant protein within the insoluble fraction, contrasting with the preferred localization within the soluble fraction for efficient downstream processing, including protein purification, formulation, characterization, and functional studies. This phenomenon underscores a common challenge associated with high-level heterologous protein expression in bacterial systems, where the propensity for protein inclusion body formation presents a substantial impediment to protein research endeavours 44 . While protein recovery from inclusion bodies is indeed possible, the process entails labour-intensive and time-consuming procedures, resulting in inevitable protein loss at each stage. Additionally, the absence of a universal technique emphasizes the necessity for a trialand-error approach to identify optimal strategies, thereby highlighting the intricate nature of protein handling in such instances. Therefore, to optimize soluble protein expression, a series of experimental conditions were systematically investigated for VP6 expression in the prokaryotic host. This included varying the concentration of the inducer (IPTG), post-induction temperature, post-induction incubation time with and without PMSF. These efforts were undertaken with the objective of enhancing protein solubility. \n\nThe inducer concentration profoundly influences the soluble protein fraction in E. coli expression systems. Higher concentrations typically yield elevated protein expression levels, potentially leading to a greater proportion of protein. Excessively high inducer concentrations can also lead to cellular stress or saturation of protein folding machinery, potentially causing misfolding, aggregation, and a decrease in solubility. Conversely, lower inducer concentrations may result in reduced protein expression but could enhance solubility by allowing for more controlled folding.

Kuri, Pranab Goswami\n## Abstract\nThe inner capsid protein of rotavirus, VP6, emerges as a promising candidate for next-generation vaccines against rotaviruses owing to its abundance in virion particles and high conservation. However, the formation of inclusion bodies during prokaryotic VP6 expression poses a significant hurdle to rotavirus research and applications. Here, we employed experimental and computational approaches to investigate inclusion body formation and aggregation-prone regions (APRs). Heterologous recombinant VP6 expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells resulted in inclusion body formation, confirmed by transmission electron microscopy revealing amorphous aggregates. Thioflavin T assay demonstrated incubation temperature-dependent aggregation of VP6 inclusion bodies. Computational predictions of APRs in rotavirus A VP6 protein were performed using sequence-based tools (TANGO, AGGRESCAN, Zyggregator, Waltz, FoldAmyloid, ANuPP, Camsol intrinsic) and structure-based tools (SolubiS, CamSol structurally corrected, Aggrescan3D). A total of 24 consensus APRs were identified, with 21 of them being surface-exposed in VP6. All identified APRs display a predominance of hydrophobic amino acids, ranging from 33 to 100%. Computational identification of these APRs corroborates our experimental observation of VP6 inclusion body or aggregate formation. Characterization of VP6's aggregation propensity facilitates understanding of its behaviour during prokaryotic expression and opens avenues for protein engineering of soluble variants, advancing research on rotavirus VP6 in pathology, therapy, and diagnostics.\n## Discussion\nIn this investigation, we evaluated the heterologous prokaryotic expression of codon-optimized rotavirus A VP6 in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Subsequent protein extraction and solubility analysis revealed an abundant presence of the recombinant protein within the insoluble fraction, contrasting with the preferred localization within the soluble fraction for efficient downstream processing, including protein purification, formulation, characterization, and functional studies. This phenomenon underscores a common challenge associated with high-level heterologous protein expression in bacterial systems, where the propensity for protein inclusion body formation presents a substantial impediment to protein research endeavours 44 . While protein recovery from inclusion bodies is indeed possible, the process entails labour-intensive and time-consuming procedures, resulting in inevitable protein loss at each stage. Additionally, the absence of a universal technique emphasizes the necessity for a trialand-error approach to identify optimal strategies, thereby highlighting the intricate nature of protein handling in such instances. Therefore, to optimize soluble protein expression, a series of experimental conditions were systematically investigated for VP6 expression in the prokaryotic host. This included varying the concentration of the inducer (IPTG), post-induction temperature, post-induction incubation time with and without PMSF. These efforts were undertaken with the objective of enhancing protein solubility. \n\nThe inducer concentration profoundly influences the soluble protein fraction in E. coli expression systems. Higher concentrations typically yield elevated protein expression levels, potentially leading to a greater proportion of protein. Excessively high inducer concentrations can also lead to cellular stress or saturation of protein folding machinery, potentially causing misfolding, aggregation, and a decrease in solubility. Conversely, lower inducer concentrations may result in reduced protein expression but could enhance solubility by allowing for more controlled folding. However, excessively low inducer concentrations may not provide sufficient stimulation for protein expression, leading to inadequate levels of soluble protein. Thus, an optimal inducer concentration is crucial, striking a balance between robust protein expression and efficient folding to maximize soluble protein fraction while minimizing aggregation and cellular stress 52 .",

These structures are associated with chaperones like IbpA. However, there are reported cases of \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies in which proteins are soluble, folded and active.ResultsWe report that the Brucella abortus PdhS histidine kinase fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein forms intermediate aggregates resembling \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies when overproduced in E. coli, before forming \"classical\" inclusion bodies. The intermediate aggregates of PdhS-mCherry are characterized by the solubility of PdhS-mCherry, its ability to specifically recruit known partners fused to YFP, suggesting that PdhS is folded in these conditions, and the quick elimination (in less than 10 min) of these structures when bacterial cells are placed on fresh rich medium. Moreover, soluble PdhS-mCherry foci do not systematically colocalize with IpbA-YFP, a marker of inclusion bodies. Instead, time-lapse experiments show that IbpA-YFP exhibits rapid pole-to-pole shuttling, until it partially colocalizes with PdhS-mCherry aggregates.ConclusionThe data reported here suggest that, in E. coli, recombinant proteins like PdhS-mCherry may transit through a soluble and folded state, resembling previously reported \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies, before forming \"classical\" inclusion bodies. The dynamic localization of IbpA-YFP foci suggests that the IbpA chaperone could scan the E. coli cell to find its substrates.",

One of the major concerns in the overproduction process is the formation of insoluble structures called inclusions bodies (IB) [1,2]. IB formation results from the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides that have escaped quality control by chaperones and proteases to interact through their exposed hydrophobic regions before precipitating [3]. Aggregate formation and features are influenced by various growth conditions such as temperature and pH [4], culture phase [5] and glucose/oxygen availability [6].\n\nIn vivo protein aggregation is a dynamic reversible process [7]. Chaperones involved in aggregate dissociation, e.g. DnaK/DnaJ/ClpB and IbpA/IbpB, colocalize with IB in E. coli [8][9][10][11]. Recently, it has been reported that aggregate cellular localization is not random [9].

Charlier, Micha\u00ebl Deghelt, J. Wouters, J. Matroule, J. Letesson, X. De Bolle\n## Abstract\nBackgroundWhen heterologous recombinant proteins are produced in Escherichia coli, they often precipitate to form insoluble aggregates of unfolded polypeptides called inclusion bodies. These structures are associated with chaperones like IbpA. However, there are reported cases of \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies in which proteins are soluble, folded and active.ResultsWe report that the Brucella abortus PdhS histidine kinase fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein forms intermediate aggregates resembling \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies when overproduced in E. coli, before forming \"classical\" inclusion bodies. The intermediate aggregates of PdhS-mCherry are characterized by the solubility of PdhS-mCherry, its ability to specifically recruit known partners fused to YFP, suggesting that PdhS is folded in these conditions, and the quick elimination (in less than 10 min) of these structures when bacterial cells are placed on fresh rich medium. Moreover, soluble PdhS-mCherry foci do not systematically colocalize with IpbA-YFP, a marker of inclusion bodies. Instead, time-lapse experiments show that IbpA-YFP exhibits rapid pole-to-pole shuttling, until it partially colocalizes with PdhS-mCherry aggregates.ConclusionThe data reported here suggest that, in E. coli, recombinant proteins like PdhS-mCherry may transit through a soluble and folded state, resembling previously reported \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies, before forming \"classical\" inclusion bodies. The dynamic localization of IbpA-YFP foci suggests that the IbpA chaperone could scan the E. coli cell to find its substrates.\n## Background\nEscherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins of interest. One of the major concerns in the overproduction process is the formation of insoluble structures called inclusions bodies (IB) [1,2]. IB formation results from the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides that have escaped quality control by chaperones and proteases to interact through their exposed hydrophobic regions before precipitating [3]. Aggregate formation and features are influenced by various growth conditions such as temperature and pH [4], culture phase [5] and glucose/oxygen availability [6].\n\nIn vivo protein aggregation is a dynamic reversible process [7]. Chaperones involved in aggregate dissociation, e.g. DnaK/DnaJ/ClpB and IbpA/IbpB, colocalize with IB in E. coli [8][9][10][11]. Recently, it has been reported that aggregate cellular localization is not random [9]. Small protein aggregates are delivered to a cell pole to form larger structures that are further dissolved by an energy dependent process [12]. All proteins in IB were initially considered as unfolded, but it has been shown that some polypeptides inside aggregates are present in an active form [2,13,14]. Several groups reported the formation of \"non-classical\" IB mainly characterized by the presence of folded and soluble recombinant proteins [15,16].\n\nHere, we report a novel example of \"non-classical\" IB that contain folded and soluble recombinant proteins and only transiently interact with the IpbA chaperone.\n\nIndeed, overproduction of Brucella abortus PdhS cytoplasmic histidine kinase [17] in E. coli revealed that PdhS-mCherry fusions were first folded and soluble in aggregates formed during the stationary phase of culture before forming insoluble structures having all the characteristics of \"classical\" IB. These \"classical\" IB recruited IpbA-YFP, as previously reported for other IB in E. coli [11], unlike the intermediate \"non classical\" IB.

Fgf15 is highly expressed in the ileum and functions as an endocrine signal to regulate liver function, including bile acid synthesis, hepatocyte proliferation and insulin sensitivity. In order to fully understand the function of Fgf15, methods are needed to produce pure Fgf15 protein in the prokaryotic system. However, when expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the recombinant Fgf15 protein was insoluble and found only in inclusion bodies. In the current study, we report a method to produce recombinant Fgf15 protein in E. coli through the use of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion tag. Even though the SUMO has been shown to strongly improve protein solubility and expression levels, our studies suggest that the SUMO does not improve Fgf15 protein solubility. Instead, proper refolding of Fgf15 protein was achieved when Fgf15 was expressed as a partner protein of the fusion tag SUMO, followed by in vitro dialysis refolding. After refolding, the N-terminal SUMO tag was cleaved from the recombinant Fgf15 fusion protein by ScUlp1 (Ubiquitin-Like Protein-Specific Protease 1 from S. cerevisiae). With or without the SUMO tag, the refolded Fgf15 protein was biologically active, as revealed by its ability to reduce hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in mice. In addition, recombinant Fgf15 protein suppressed Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we have developed a successful method to express functional Fgf15 protein in prokaryotic cells.",

However, the high yield of heterologous protein in E. coli often leads to improper protein folding, which results in insoluble and non-functional proteins that are aggregated in inclusion bodies [8,9]. Even though aggregation of recombinant protein in inclusion bodies provides an easy method for protein isolation and purification, refolding of the recombinant protein in vitro to gain biological activity often presents great challenges [10]. \n\nExtensive efforts have been made to promote the expression of soluble recombinant proteins in E. coli. One strategy is to reduce protein synthesis rate by lowering incubation temperature and inducing pressure [11]. Another widely adapted strategy to improve the solubility of recombinant proteins is to add a fusion tag such as glutathione-s-transferase (GST) [12,13], maltose binding protein (MBP) [14,15], NusA [16], thioredoxin (Trx) [12,17], or small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) [18,19] to the target protein. Fusion tags have been shown to improve protein solubility as well as protein expression level in the E. coli system. However, the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli is complicated and the mechanism for this formation is not yet clear. For example, when using E. coli as a protein expression system, some eukaryotic proteins are highly likely to aggregate, regardless of the type of fusion tag used to improve protein solubility. This aggregation can lead to cumbersome and challenging procedures for in-vitro refolding. When a protein produced in the prokaryotic system is highly insoluble, the only option to make it soluble is to use a low-yield eukaryotic expression system. However, the low-yield protein will make the downstream protein purification more difficult. \n\nSUMO is a ubiquitin-related protein and regulates the activity of a wide variety of cellular target proteins by covalent modification of the target protein's lysine residues [20].",

Guo\n## Abstract\nFibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) is the mouse orthologue of human FGF19. Fgf15 is highly expressed in the ileum and functions as an endocrine signal to regulate liver function, including bile acid synthesis, hepatocyte proliferation and insulin sensitivity. In order to fully understand the function of Fgf15, methods are needed to produce pure Fgf15 protein in the prokaryotic system. However, when expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the recombinant Fgf15 protein was insoluble and found only in inclusion bodies. In the current study, we report a method to produce recombinant Fgf15 protein in E. coli through the use of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion tag. Even though the SUMO has been shown to strongly improve protein solubility and expression levels, our studies suggest that the SUMO does not improve Fgf15 protein solubility. Instead, proper refolding of Fgf15 protein was achieved when Fgf15 was expressed as a partner protein of the fusion tag SUMO, followed by in vitro dialysis refolding. After refolding, the N-terminal SUMO tag was cleaved from the recombinant Fgf15 fusion protein by ScUlp1 (Ubiquitin-Like Protein-Specific Protease 1 from S. cerevisiae). With or without the SUMO tag, the refolded Fgf15 protein was biologically active, as revealed by its ability to reduce hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in mice. In addition, recombinant Fgf15 protein suppressed Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we have developed a successful method to express functional Fgf15 protein in prokaryotic cells.\n## Introduction\nThis system produces large quantities of protein in a shorter period of time and at lower cost. However, the high yield of heterologous protein in E. coli often leads to improper protein folding, which results in insoluble and non-functional proteins that are aggregated in inclusion bodies [8,9]. Even though aggregation of recombinant protein in inclusion bodies provides an easy method for protein isolation and purification, refolding of the recombinant protein in vitro to gain biological activity often presents great challenges [10]. \n\nExtensive efforts have been made to promote the expression of soluble recombinant proteins in E. coli. One strategy is to reduce protein synthesis rate by lowering incubation temperature and inducing pressure [11]. Another widely adapted strategy to improve the solubility of recombinant proteins is to add a fusion tag such as glutathione-s-transferase (GST) [12,13], maltose binding protein (MBP) [14,15], NusA [16], thioredoxin (Trx) [12,17], or small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) [18,19] to the target protein. Fusion tags have been shown to improve protein solubility as well as protein expression level in the E. coli system. However, the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli is complicated and the mechanism for this formation is not yet clear. For example, when using E. coli as a protein expression system, some eukaryotic proteins are highly likely to aggregate, regardless of the type of fusion tag used to improve protein solubility. This aggregation can lead to cumbersome and challenging procedures for in-vitro refolding. When a protein produced in the prokaryotic system is highly insoluble, the only option to make it soluble is to use a low-yield eukaryotic expression system. However, the low-yield protein will make the downstream protein purification more difficult. \n\nSUMO is a ubiquitin-related protein and regulates the activity of a wide variety of cellular target proteins by covalent modification of the target protein's lysine residues [20].",

We previously identified ssTorA, a signal sequence that normally directs protein export via the Tat pathway in E. coli, as a tag that induces the accumulation of fused proteins into IBs under overexpression conditions. Here, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify features and motifs being either critical or dispensable for IB formation. We found that IB formation is neither related to the function of ssTorA as a Tat-signal sequence nor is it a general feature of this family of signal sequences. IB formation was inhibited by co-overexpression of ssTorA binding chaperones TorD and DnaK and by amino acid substitutions that affect the propensity of ssTorA to form an \u03b1-helix. Systematic deletion experiments identified a minimal region of ssTorA required for IB formation in the center of the signal sequence. Unbiased genetic screening of a library of randomly mutagenized ssTorA sequences for reduced aggregation properties allowed us to pinpoint residues that are critical to sustain insoluble expression. Together, the data point to possible mechanisms for the aggregation of ssTorA fusions. Additionally, they led to the design of a tag with superior IB-formation properties compared to the original ssTorA sequence.",

                    "text": "Heterologous proteins that are overexpressed in microbial hosts such as E. coli often accumulate in insoluble clusters called inclusion bodies (IBs). The IBs preferentially localize at the poles of the bacteria, which is thought to be related to the accumulation of dense DNA central in the cells. The IBs vary in size from 0.1 to 1 \u00b5m and although their chemical composition may vary, they consist predominantly of the overexpressed recombinant protein (Ramon et al., 2014;de Marco et al., 2019). Traditionally, IB formation is linked to the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides and seen as an obstacle in production processes aimed at high yields of soluble, active protein species. To avoid aggregation several strategies have been explored including lowering of transcription and translation rates, reduction of the growth temperature and co-expression of chaperones that assist in proper folding (Kaur et al., 2018). Alternatively, IBs can be isolated, denatured and subjected to refolding conditions to regenerate the active protein (Yamaguchi and Miyazaki, 2014;Singh et al., 2015). \n\nRather than being regarded as an undesirable side effect of industrial protein production, the generation of IBs is now increasingly appreciated as a useful strategy to obtain recombinant protein. Proteins in IBs are largely resistant against degradation by host cell proteases and less likely to exert toxic effects in the expression host. In addition, owing to their high density, IBs are easy to isolate from cell lysates by differential centrifugation, providing robust and cost-efficient protocols to obtain large amounts of relatively pure protein (Swartz, 2001;Sahdev et al., 2008;Martinez-Alonso et al., 2009). Moreover, whereas IBs for long were considered to be amorphous aggregates of disordered protein, they actually display a structured \u03b2-sheet organization and can contain significant amounts of protein in a native conformation. This makes them interesting as a supply of nanostructured biomaterial with high mechanical stability, biological activity and slow protein release properties.",

Luirink\n## Abstract\nWhereas, bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) for long were regarded as undesirable aggregates emerging during recombinant protein production, they currently receive attention as promising nanoparticulate biomaterials with diverse applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. We previously identified ssTorA, a signal sequence that normally directs protein export via the Tat pathway in E. coli, as a tag that induces the accumulation of fused proteins into IBs under overexpression conditions. Here, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify features and motifs being either critical or dispensable for IB formation. We found that IB formation is neither related to the function of ssTorA as a Tat-signal sequence nor is it a general feature of this family of signal sequences. IB formation was inhibited by co-overexpression of ssTorA binding chaperones TorD and DnaK and by amino acid substitutions that affect the propensity of ssTorA to form an \u03b1-helix. Systematic deletion experiments identified a minimal region of ssTorA required for IB formation in the center of the signal sequence. Unbiased genetic screening of a library of randomly mutagenized ssTorA sequences for reduced aggregation properties allowed us to pinpoint residues that are critical to sustain insoluble expression. Together, the data point to possible mechanisms for the aggregation of ssTorA fusions. Additionally, they led to the design of a tag with superior IB-formation properties compared to the original ssTorA sequence.\n## INTRODUCTION\nHeterologous proteins that are overexpressed in microbial hosts such as E. coli often accumulate in insoluble clusters called inclusion bodies (IBs). The IBs preferentially localize at the poles of the bacteria, which is thought to be related to the accumulation of dense DNA central in the cells. The IBs vary in size from 0.1 to 1 \u00b5m and although their chemical composition may vary, they consist predominantly of the overexpressed recombinant protein (Ramon et al., 2014;de Marco et al., 2019). Traditionally, IB formation is linked to the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides and seen as an obstacle in production processes aimed at high yields of soluble, active protein species. To avoid aggregation several strategies have been explored including lowering of transcription and translation rates, reduction of the growth temperature and co-expression of chaperones that assist in proper folding (Kaur et al., 2018). Alternatively, IBs can be isolated, denatured and subjected to refolding conditions to regenerate the active protein (Yamaguchi and Miyazaki, 2014;Singh et al., 2015). \n\nRather than being regarded as an undesirable side effect of industrial protein production, the generation of IBs is now increasingly appreciated as a useful strategy to obtain recombinant protein. Proteins in IBs are largely resistant against degradation by host cell proteases and less likely to exert toxic effects in the expression host. In addition, owing to their high density, IBs are easy to isolate from cell lysates by differential centrifugation, providing robust and cost-efficient protocols to obtain large amounts of relatively pure protein (Swartz, 2001;Sahdev et al., 2008;Martinez-Alonso et al., 2009). Moreover, whereas IBs for long were considered to be amorphous aggregates of disordered protein, they actually display a structured \u03b2-sheet organization and can contain significant amounts of protein in a native conformation. This makes them interesting as a supply of nanostructured biomaterial with high mechanical stability, biological activity and slow protein release properties.",

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein . Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to maximize the efficient production of soluble recombinant proteins in bacteria. A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co-expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in E. coli, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 5.24.1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein.

Page\n## Abstract\nRecombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is simple, fast, inexpensive, and robust, with the expressed protein comprising up to 50 percent of the total cellular protein. However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli. This overview describes variables at each stage of a protein expression experiment that can influence solubility and offers a summary of strategies used to optimize soluble expression in E. coli. Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 61:5.24.1\u20105.24.29. \u00a9 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n## INTRODUCTION\nkaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool  Spirin, 2004;Langlais et al., 2007; for other references, see text.\n\nof partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded, insoluble proteins (Oberg et al., 1994). Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein . Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to maximize the efficient production of soluble recombinant proteins in bacteria. A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co-expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in E. coli, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 5.24.1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein.

                    "text": "Recombinant DNA-mediated polypeptide production remains a popular approach for obtaining properly folded disulfide-containing protein and peptides. Many reviews are available that address the effect of various parameters such as different host organisms [78,79], expression vectors [80], expression rate [81,82], and purification [83,84]. With respect to host systems, many cell lines are available for expressing recombinant peptides and proteins such as E. coli [85], Chinese hamster ovary cells [86], human embryonic kidney cells [87], and S. cerevisiae [88]. The wide range of molecular biology options with E. coli systems provides many options to ensure proper disulfide bond generation [89,90]. E. coli expression is fast and inexpensive to scale-up but not all proteins are amenable to expression in this system [91,92]. \n\nA major challenge in obtaining a recombinant protein is correct folding. A protein synthesized in a recombinant cell is often produced in reduced form, which is then oxidized (refolded) using suitable folding conditions [93,94]. The target crude peptide/protein can be obtained in reduced form and then refolded with the aid of various enzymes as disulfide catalyst systems [95,96]. Alternatively, oxidative folding is possible without the use of any enzyme [97,98]. However, such refolding can be a problematic step. Misfolding is a major issue with cysteine-containing polypeptides resulting in low yields. This limitation has necessitated the development of new methodologies to enable the acquisition of correctly folded protein or peptide in its native form in high yields. To assist the refolding, various tactics have been employed including inclusion body formation [99,100], co-expression of supporting enzymes [101,102] and chemical assistance [100].",

Patil, J. Tailhades, R. Hughes, F. Separovic, J. Wade, M. Hossain\n## Abstract\nBioactive peptides play important roles in metabolic regulation and modulation and many are used as therapeutics. These peptides often possess disulfide bonds, which are important for their structure, function and stability. A systematic network of enzymes\u2014a disulfide bond generating enzyme, a disulfide bond donor enzyme and a redox cofactor\u2014that function inside the cell dictates the formation and maintenance of disulfide bonds. The main pathways that catalyze disulfide bond formation in peptides and proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are remarkably similar and share several mechanistic features. This review summarizes the formation of disulfide bonds in peptides and proteins by cellular and recombinant machinery.\n## Folding of Disulfide-Containing Bioactive Peptides and Proteins via Recombinant Technology\nRecombinant DNA-mediated polypeptide production remains a popular approach for obtaining properly folded disulfide-containing protein and peptides. Many reviews are available that address the effect of various parameters such as different host organisms [78,79], expression vectors [80], expression rate [81,82], and purification [83,84]. With respect to host systems, many cell lines are available for expressing recombinant peptides and proteins such as E. coli [85], Chinese hamster ovary cells [86], human embryonic kidney cells [87], and S. cerevisiae [88]. The wide range of molecular biology options with E. coli systems provides many options to ensure proper disulfide bond generation [89,90]. E. coli expression is fast and inexpensive to scale-up but not all proteins are amenable to expression in this system [91,92]. \n\nA major challenge in obtaining a recombinant protein is correct folding. A protein synthesized in a recombinant cell is often produced in reduced form, which is then oxidized (refolded) using suitable folding conditions [93,94]. The target crude peptide/protein can be obtained in reduced form and then refolded with the aid of various enzymes as disulfide catalyst systems [95,96]. Alternatively, oxidative folding is possible without the use of any enzyme [97,98]. However, such refolding can be a problematic step. Misfolding is a major issue with cysteine-containing polypeptides resulting in low yields. This limitation has necessitated the development of new methodologies to enable the acquisition of correctly folded protein or peptide in its native form in high yields. To assist the refolding, various tactics have been employed including inclusion body formation [99,100], co-expression of supporting enzymes [101,102] and chemical assistance [100].",

On the other hand, the newly synthesized recombinant polypeptide is expressed in the microenvironment of the host that may differ from that of the original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, cofactors, and folding mechanisms. High local concentrations of the nascent heterologous protein together with an insufficient amount of folding-promoting chaperons may lead to partially folded or misfolded protein intermediates that give rise to the formation, in both the cytoplasm and periplasm, of insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies, IBs [77]. Usually, these intermediates expose on their surface hydrophobic patches that interact with similar regions and together with the formation of uncorrected disulfide bonds can lead to protein aggregation and precipitation Protein recovery strategies from inclusion bodies via solubilization and refolding processes are laborious, time-consuming and expensive, although various refolding procedures have been developed for therapeutic proteins and applied for antibody fragments [78][79][80]. An introduction to the IB refolding procedure [81] is outside the scope of this review. Rather, we will look at other more profitable and convenient strategies such as periplasmic and extracellular expression strategies and also co-expression with molecular chaperons for improving solubility and proper folding of antibody-like fragments, even on a laboratory scale.",

            "text": "Among the available expression hosts, E. coli remains the most attractive one for production of heterologous proteins for a variety of downstream utilization. Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [12]. However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins [6,9]. Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein [13]. So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins [14]. Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host. Varying several parameters such as fusion partners, post induction temperature, promoters, or E. coli strains have been reported to be able to alleviate the insolubility problem and increase the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [15].",

            "text": "Over-expression of heterologous proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli is often accompanied by their accumulation into insoluble aggregates. The aggregated proteins lose their correct conformations and are deposited to inclusion bodies known to be in the inactive form of the protein (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). \n\nAlthough inclusion body formation can greatly simplify and Sambrook, 1992). During over-expression of proteins in Escherichia coli, the bacterial chaperones might get titrated out and thus fail to meet the demand of an overload of nascent polypeptides (Schweder et al., 2002). \n\nIn this regard, increasing the chaperone supply seems a noticeable solution to the problems arising from formation of inclusion bodies during over-production of recombinant proteins (Schlieker et al., 2002). Goloubinoff et al. (1989) first demonstrated that chaperone co-overexpression is a powerful tool to improving the folding of heterologous proteins by showing that the yield of active Aspergillus nidulanse RUBISCO was increased 10-folds in the cells harboring groELS operon. Subsequently, lots of attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded and soluble recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of chaperones combination in producing cells. \n\nIt is still a trial and error process to find a compatible chaperone system to increase the solubility of the target protein. For instance, GroELS or DnaKJ were effective for some proteins such as RUBISCO, human procollagenase, E. coli glutamate racemase but along with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, yeast N-myristoyl transferase and \u03b2-galactosidase-bovine somatotropin fusion protein both chaperone systems demonstrate the lack of effect (Goloubinoff et al., 1989;Lee and Olins, 1992;Ferreyra et al., 1993). Nishahara et al. (2000) reported the effect of chaperone combinations on the three different aggregation prone proteins.",

            "text": "The development of complementary technologies enabled the successful production of recombinant polypeptides in bacteria and opened to biology researchers new avenues as obtaining suitable amounts of proteins necessary for their experimental work became easy, fast, and inexpensive. Nevertheless, the recombinant approach remained somehow unpredictable, since many constructs resisted to apparent production or accumulated as aggregates.Several factors and physical/chemical conditions that could improve the accumulation of native-like protein were identified. At the same time, it was acknowledged that the outcome of most of them was erratic and that almost any protein required its own specific optimized set of conditions to achieve its correct folding. The attempt to understand the critical points specific for recombinant protein production missed the goal of setting universally useful protocols, but contributed to the increase of the rate of success by proposing always new empiric combinations.Nevertheless, the results published in the recent literature allow for a better comprehension of some key mechanisms controlling protein production in E. coli and could enable the elaboration of rational methodologies for improving the quantitative and qualitative features of the produced polypeptides. This result will be achieved when the identification of the limiting step that impairs the accomplishment of the native folding for any single construct will become straightforward. This minireview will discuss how factors such as the expression rate, the folding machinery, and the secretion efficiency may impact the final protein yields.",

            "text": "Production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins. One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation [25][26][27]. The commonly used molecular chaperones in E. coli are GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor (Table 2). These cytoplasmic chaperones can be employed either individually or in combination of different chaperones to enhance protein solubility and prevent formation of inclusion bodies [10,26,28,29]. The GroEL-GroES chaperone combination is highly efficient to enhance protein refolding and also prevent protein degradation. It has been shown that Trigger factor interacts with GroEL and increases GroEL-substrate binding to improve protein folding [30]. Some chaperones such as heat shock proteins IpbA and IpbB prevent aggregation of heat denatured proteins [31]. It is advisable to test different combinations of molecular chaperones to identify the most efficient combination for improving the solubility of heterologous recombinant proteins. Co-expression of molecular chaperones Skp and FkpA in E. coli had been shown to improve the solubility of antibody fragments [32].",

Co-expression of chaperon systems accompanied by recombinant protein is a general method to increase the production yield. However, it has not been successful enough due to imposed intense stress to the host cells. The aim of this study was to balance the rate of protein production and the imposed cellular stresses using a two-step expression system. For this purpose, in the first step, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed as a recombinant protein model under control of the T7-TetO artificial promoter-operator, accompanied by Dnak/J/GrpE chaperon system. Then, in the next step, TetR repressor was activated automatically under the control of the stress promoter ibpAB and suppressed the GFP production after accumulation of inclusion bodies. Thus in this step incorrect folded proteins and inclusion bodies are refolded causing increased yield and solubility of the recombinant protein and restarting GFP expression again. Total GFP, soluble and insoluble GFP fractions, were measured by Synergy H1 multiple reader. Results showed that expression yield and soluble/insoluble ratio of GFP have been increased 5 and 2.5 times using this system in comparison with the single step process, respectively. The efficiency of this system in increasing solubility and production yield of recombinant proteins was confirmed. The two-step system must be evaluated for expression of various proteins to further confirm its applicability in the field of recombinant protein production.",

Escherichia coli is one of the best known and most often used host organisms for economical protein production. However, upon over-expression, protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs) are often formed. Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications.

            "text": "There has been a growing interest from researchers in expressing recombinant proteins in the periplasm of E. coli [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] , owing to the attractiveness of periplasmic expression. For example, periplasmic expression significantly facilitates downstream purification and produces target proteins with authentic N-terminal sequences upon proper cleavage of signal peptides 9 , which is otherwise not achievable through cytoplasmic expression. In addition, periplasm is the only oxidizing compartment in genetically unmodified E. coli cells and also the host to various chaperones and foldases 10 . These proteins and enzymes play crucial roles in facilitating proper protein folding and disulfide bond formation to ensure their biological functions.\n\nThe solubility of recombinant proteins upon expression in E. coli has been a main focus in protein expression studies. Overexpression of proteins generally gives high yield, but mostly in the form of inclusion bodies 11,12 . Despite the advantage of producing higher protein yield in the form of inclusion bodies, a series of onerous and expensive tasks are involved in resolubilizing the protein aggregates and refolding them 13 . Furthermore, there is no guarantee of retaining the biological activity of a protein after its refolding. Significant decrease in production yield upon refolding and purification is also common 9 . There are a number of examples of studies that report on the formation of inclusion bodies when proteins were heterologously expressed in the periplasm [14][15][16][17] , which suggest the possibility of inclusion body formation during periplasmic expression under certain conditions. On one hand, it is well-known that amino acid sequence is the major determinant of protein solubility 11,18,19 . The choice of signal peptide, on the other hand, has also been recognized as another important factor that strongly influences the protein secretion efficiency 20 and also affects the protein expression yield in the periplasm.

            "text": "In this investigation, we evaluated the heterologous prokaryotic expression of codon-optimized rotavirus A VP6 in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Subsequent protein extraction and solubility analysis revealed an abundant presence of the recombinant protein within the insoluble fraction, contrasting with the preferred localization within the soluble fraction for efficient downstream processing, including protein purification, formulation, characterization, and functional studies. This phenomenon underscores a common challenge associated with high-level heterologous protein expression in bacterial systems, where the propensity for protein inclusion body formation presents a substantial impediment to protein research endeavours 44 . While protein recovery from inclusion bodies is indeed possible, the process entails labour-intensive and time-consuming procedures, resulting in inevitable protein loss at each stage. Additionally, the absence of a universal technique emphasizes the necessity for a trialand-error approach to identify optimal strategies, thereby highlighting the intricate nature of protein handling in such instances. Therefore, to optimize soluble protein expression, a series of experimental conditions were systematically investigated for VP6 expression in the prokaryotic host. This included varying the concentration of the inducer (IPTG), post-induction temperature, post-induction incubation time with and without PMSF. These efforts were undertaken with the objective of enhancing protein solubility. \n\nThe inducer concentration profoundly influences the soluble protein fraction in E. coli expression systems. Higher concentrations typically yield elevated protein expression levels, potentially leading to a greater proportion of protein. Excessively high inducer concentrations can also lead to cellular stress or saturation of protein folding machinery, potentially causing misfolding, aggregation, and a decrease in solubility. Conversely, lower inducer concentrations may result in reduced protein expression but could enhance solubility by allowing for more controlled folding. However, excessively low inducer concentrations may not provide sufficient stimulation for protein expression, leading to inadequate levels of soluble protein. Thus, an optimal inducer concentration is crucial, striking a balance between robust protein expression and efficient folding to maximize soluble protein fraction while minimizing aggregation and cellular stress 52 .",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields [1]. Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs [2,3]. To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins [1][2][3]. A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs [4][5][6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product [7]. \n\nAnother obstacle in recombinant protein production in E. coli cells is accumulation of acetate during extensive aerobic fermentation in cultures supplemented with glucose. At higher glucose concentrations, the carbon flux into the cells exceeds tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, and acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate, which is easily excreted from the cell. The excretion of acetate into the environment results also from the need to regenerate the NAD + consumed by glycolysis and to recycle the CoA that is required to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [8]. A high concentration of acetate, externally added or excreted from the cell, limits the growth of E. coli.",

            "text": "E. coli is preferred for heterologous protein production because of its fast growth, simple fermentation, uncomplicated nutritional and sterility requirements, and extensive characterisation [1]. Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.",

Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012). Moreover, the industrial culture of E. coli leads cells to grow in harsh conditions, resulting in cell physiology deterioration (Chou, 2007;Pacheco et al., 2012).\n\nDespite the above-mentioned issues of E. coli recombinant protein production, the benefits of cost and ease of use and scale make it essential to design new strategies directed for recombinant soluble protein production in this host cell. Several strategies have been made for efficient production of proteins in E. coli, namely, the use of different mutated host strains, co-production of chaperones and foldases, lowering cultivation temperatures, and addition of a fusion partner (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). The combination of some of these strategies has improved the soluble production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, but the prediction of robust soluble protein production processes is still a \"a challenge and a necessity\" (Jana and Deb, 2005).\n\nNowadays, with the aid of genetic and protein engineering, novel tailor-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements.\n\nThis review describes the key solubility factors that correlate with successful protein production in E. coli, and it presents a comprehensive summary of the available fusion partners for protein production and purification in the bacterial host.

            "text": "Background: Overexpressed heterogeneous protein often exists as soluble and insoluble forms. Results: Escherichia coli cells overexpressing heterogeneous \u03b2-galactosidase are mainly composed of two subpopulations with soluble protein and inclusion bodies, respectively. Conclusion: The ratio of soluble and insoluble protein is determined by the ratio of the two cell subpopulations. Significance: Our data shed new light on the formation of the equilibrium between soluble and insoluble forms. The mechanism by which inclusion bodies form is still not well understood, partly because the dynamic processes of the inclusion body formation and its solubilization have hardly been investigated at an individual cell level, and so the important detailed information has not been acquired for the mechanism. In this study, we investigated the in vivo folding and aggregation of Aspergillus phoenicis \u03b2-d-galactosidase fused to a red fluorescence protein in individual Escherichia coli cells. The folding status and expression level of the recombinant \u03b2-d-galactosidase at an individual cell level was analyzed by flow cytometry in combination with transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. We found that individual E. coli cells fell into two distinct states, one containing only inclusion bodies accompanied with low galactosidase activity and the other containing the recombinant soluble galactosidase accompanied with high galactosidase activity. The majority of the E. coli cells in the later state possessed no inclusion bodies. The two states of the cells were shifted to a cell state with high enzyme activity by culturing the cells in isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside-free medium after an initial protein expression induction in isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside-containing medium. This shift of the cell population status took place without the level change of the \u03b2-d-galactosidase protein in individual cells, indicating that the factor(s) besides the crowdedness of the recombinant protein play a major role in the cell state transition. These results shed new light on the mechanism of inclusion body formation and will facilitate the development of new strategies in improving rec",

The newly synthesized recombinant polypeptide is expressed in the microenvironment of E. coli, which may differ from that of the original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, cofactors, and folding Frontiers in Microbiology | Microbiotechnology, Ecotoxicology and Bioremediation mechanisms. Also, in high level expression, hydrophobic stretches in the polypeptide are present at high concentrations and available for interaction with similar regions. All of these factors lead to protein instability and aggregation (Hartley and Kane, 1988;Carrio and Villaverde, 2002). These buildups of protein aggregates are known as IBs. IB formation results from an unbalanced equilibrium between protein aggregation and solubilization. So, it is possible to obtain a soluble recombinant protein by strategies that ameliorate the factors leading to IB formation Villaverde, 2001, 2002). One is to fuse the desired protein to a fusion partner that acts as a solubility enhancer. Some examples were already described in Section \"Affinity Tags.\" In some cases the generation of IB can be an advantage, especially if the protein can be refolded easily in vitro. If that is the case, conditions can be adjusted to favor the formation IB, providing a simple method for achieving a significant one-step purification of the expressed protein (Burgess, 2009;Basu et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is extensively used for industrial production of recombinant proteins due to its well-characterized genetics and ability to grow rapidly to a high density on inexpensive substrates [1]. However, it is a common problem for recombinant protein aggregates to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and/or periplasm upon gene over-expression in E. coli [2,3]. This complex phenomenon has many contributing factors: insolubility of the product at the concentrations being produced, inability to fold correctly in the bacterial environment, or lack of appropriate bacterial chaperone proteins [4,5]. Several strategies are commonly employed to reduce inclusion bodies: a) controlling the rate of protein synthesis, b) enabling secretion into the periplasm, and c) co-expression of chaperone genes. The control of the rate of protein synthesis can be achieved by changing the promoter to regulate the level of expression, fusing the target gene to another gene, and adjusting the growth conditions, such as pH and temperature of the medium [6]. The secretion of recombinant proteins into the periplasm of E. coli has also been shown to benefit the production of certain recombinant proteins resulting in higher solubility of the gene product, correct folding, and facilitated downstream processing [1,5,7,8,9,10], although inclusion bodies may still form in the periplasm [11,12]. The E. coli periplasm is an oxidizing environment that contains a series of chaperones or enzymes promoting the appropriate folding of proteins [13,14,15,16]. Some E. coli periplasmic proteins such as DegP and FkpA participate in the folding of certain secreted recombinant proteins [17,18,19]. Finally, increasing the concentration of chaperones in a heat-shock system regulated by s 32 in E. coli has been shown to assist in the correct folding of the target protein [20,21,22], and co-expression of DnaK-DnaJ can greatly increase the soluble proportion of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm [22].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most common production hosts for recombinant proteins and many expression construct components are available to improve yields and facilitate protein recovery, including a variety of promoters and fusion proteins (Moore et al., 2016;Schreiber et al., 2017). Although, many recombinant proteins are strongly expressed with short production times and can be recovered as soluble products, others are difficult to express either because they are toxic to the host, resulting in low yields, or because they form insoluble inclusion bodies due to incomplete or incorrect folding (Carri\u00f3 and Villaverde, 2002;Sa\u00efda, 2007). These challenges are often encountered when expressing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), many of which require the formation of disulfide bonds for efficient folding and biological activity. In some cases inclusion bodies are produced deliberately, but the purification and refolding of insoluble proteins requires elaborate downstream processing and often limits the yield and functionality of the product (Hoffmann et al., 2018). \n\nThe folding of recombinant proteins in bacteria can also be improved by targeting the periplasm, a space between the outer and inner membrane that contains more chaperones than the cytoplasm, thus promoting folding and resulting in higher yields and less complex downstream processing steps. The oxidizing environment of the periplasm also favors the formation of disulfide bonds (Choi and Lee, 2004;Balasundaram et al., 2009). Translocation of proteins to the periplasm has been a subject to research since the very beginnings of recombinant protein expression technology (Gray et al., 1985;Oliveira et al., 1999). There are two major protein secretion pathways in bacteria. The general secretory (Sec) pathway exports unfolded proteins during or after translation (Tsirigotaki et al., 2017) whereas the twinarginine translocation (Tat) pathway exports folded proteins.

            "text": "Protein expression in E. coli is relatively simple and inexpensive and the variety of available plasmids, fusion partners and strains makes it often the preferred method for production of AMPs [103,104]. However, major drawbacks have been reported using bacteria for effective AMP production as discussed below. \n\nFirst of all, the recombinant protein often needs to be fused to a carrier protein to neutralize its toxicity towards the host and to increase its solubility to avoid formation of inclusion bodies [105]. This fusion partner needs to be released during or after purification of the protein of interest via enzymatic or chemical cleavage to render functional proteins, which results in a decreased yield [102]. In addition, fusion proteins are not necessarily properly folded and production of these proteins can result in so-called \"soluble inclusion bodies\" [105]. Recently, it was shown that co-expression of the human Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase (QSOX), a chaperone with thiol/disulphide oxidase activity, in the cytoplasm of E. coli can counter protein misfolding and increase the yield of soluble cysteine-rich proteins [106,107]. Although such approach improves protein production in E. coli, other obstacles remain. \n\nDirect secretion mechanisms are not present in E. coli strains used for recombinant protein production, which complicates protein purification. Protein secretion can be obtained, however, by destabilization of the E. coli structural components or by using leaky strains that lack certain structural components or mutant strains in which secretion modules derived from pathogenic E. coli or other species are incorporated [103,[108][109][110][111]. \n\nFinally, and most importantly, the protein of interest often requires complex folding, including the formation of multiple disulphide bonds and/or glycosylation. In both cases, an eukaryotic system is preferred [112]. In addition, Puertas and colleagues reported that the protein yield, when using E. coli as a host for recombinant production, is inversely proportional to the cysteine content of the protein [113].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli recombinant protein production systems are designed to achieve a high accumulation of soluble protein product in the bacterial cell. However, a strong and rapid protein production can lead to stressful situations for the host cell, resulting in protein misfolding in vivo, and consequent aggregation into inclusion bodies (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b;Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010). For instance, macromolecular crowding of proteins at high concentrations in the E. coli cytoplasm often impairs the correct folding of proteins, leading to the formation of folding intermediates that, when inefficiently processed by molecular chaperones, promote inclusion body formation (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b).\n\nStrategies that direct the soluble production of proteins in E. coli are, thus, envisaged, and become more attractive than protein refolding procedures from inclusion bodies.\n\nSeveral methods have been shown to prevent or decrease protein aggregation during protein production in E. coli on a trial-and-error basis, including:\n\n(i) Lower expression temperatures: bacteria cultivation at reduced temperatures is often used to reduce protein aggregation, since it slows down the rate of protein synthesis and folding kinetics, decreasing the hydrophobic interactions that are involved in protein self-aggregation (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). Low cultivation temperatures can also reduce or impair protein degradation due to a poor activity of heat shock proteases that are usually induced during protein overproduction in E. coli (Chesshyre and Hipkiss, 1989). This strategy has, however, some drawbacks as the reduction of temperature can also affect replication, transcription, and translation rates, besides decreasing the bacterial growth and protein production yields. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by the use of coldinducible promoters that maximize protein production under low temperature conditions (Mujacic et al., 1999). (ii) E. coli-engineered host strains: E. coli mutant strains are a significant advance toward the soluble production of difficult recombinant proteins. Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Ma",

            "text": "The expression of recombinant proteins is important for the study of the biological functions of genes, the development of therapeutic drugs [1], and for industrial processes [2].There are several protein expression systems to produce the target proteins, such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems.Expression in mammalian cells and insect cells produces biologically active proteins that contain post-translational modification(s), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation.However, expression using these systems gives low yields of the recombinant proteins, and the cost of these systems is generally expensive for industrial-scale protein production.Cell-free systems also give low yields of the recombinant proteins.Among the cell-free systems, the Escherichia coli (E.coli) overexpression system is the most convenient and frequently used to produce recombinant proteins [1,3].\n\nRecombinant proteins often require the assistance of folding modulators, such as chaperone proteins, during expression in E. coli.In the overexpression system, the rate of protein aggregation is often much greater than that of proper folding and chaperone proteins are rapidly used up [4].These protein aggregates are called inclusion bodies.As the target proteins are usually purified from soluble fractions in bacteria cell lysates, the formation of inclusion bodies is often a drawback in the use of E. coli expression systems [2].Changing the growth conditions, such as growth temperature, concentration of inducer, and induction time, can often help in decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies (insoluble fraction of the proteins).Recently, it has been reported that recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the soluble form in the expression system by adding compatible solutes (chemical additives) in the expression medium [5].Instead of forming inclusion bodies, the target protein could be expressed as a soluble protein in the presence of sorbitol, arginine, and trehalose in the expression medium [5].It is expected that appropriate additives can suppress the formation of inclusion bodies and, thus, increase the solubility of target proteins in E. coli overexpression systems.",

When a large quantity of protein is expressed, macromolecular crowding (200-300 mg/ml in the cytoplasm) presents an unfavorable environment for protein folding. Frequently, the result of a high concentration of incorrectly folded recombinant protein is the formation of inclusion bodies [30]. In fact, the level of aggregated protein can increase to the extent that inclusion bodies are observable by light microscopy as round bodies surrounding the cytosol of E. coli [31]. While the formation of inclusion bodies does aVord protection from proteolytic degradation, and re-folding can recover active proteins from inactive inclusion bodies, the initial expression of correctly folded, soluble recombinant protein is ideal [32].\n\nSeveral strategies have been developed to promote the expression of properly folded recombinant protein, including co-expression of molecular chaperones [2] and foldases [33], expression of secreted proteins [34], and expression of protein fusions [35].

Protein aggregates already exist in the soluble cell fraction, and can involve native or quasi-native protein species. The main cytoplasmic chaperones involved in the protein folding process (red arrows) include the trigger factor, DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL and GroES. Both soluble aggregates and individual protein species can enter the virtual insoluble cell fraction (indicated by a dashed line) and deposit as inclusion bodies, in a fully reversible process (green arrows). Protein release from inclusion bodies is mainly controlled by DnaK, ClpB and IbpA,B. Proteases (lon, ClpP and others) attack both soluble and insoluble species with folding defects.

            "text": "In this research, the heat shock method was used due to its advantages, which include not requiring specialized expression. Consequently, intracellular protein expression is often employed as a method to enhance recombinant protein production. However, intracellular protein expression in E. coli is subject to certain limitations, such as the formation of inclusion bodies. Multiple factors influence the formation of these inclusion bodies, including misfolding of proteins, low levels of chaperones, which impede proper protein conformation under reduced cytoplasmic conditions, and susceptibility to degradation by proteases [14]. To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19]. \n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24].",

Due to shortages in chaperone availability, a significant portion of the recombinant product may be deposited in these insoluble aggregates ( Figure 4A). Since it is still unknown what percentage of active product is present in the IBs [11], we further analyzed the distribution of   Figure 4C).\n\nOur analysis shows that the native expression system without feedback leads to the highest amount of total GFP, but at the same time with a high percentage of insoluble GFP in the cell ( Figure 4B and 4C). Some variants with the feedback-based expression system were found to increase the soluble fraction, albeit at the expense of lower protein yield. The observed dynamics are consistent with what we would expect due to the trade-off between protein solubility and yield. The reduced protein yield is expected as the feedback mechanism is designed to reduce GFP expression upon stress. Interestingly, variability across clones was also observed here, with some clones retaining the protein yield and quality of the native expression system, while others favoring protein solubility over protein yield, for the wild type P IbpAB promoter (with strong RBS) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The intracellular levels of TetR protein were analyzed by Western blot analysis and support data obtained throughout the study showing that different variants and combinations of stress promoter and RBS indeed resulted in different intracellular TetR levels, with similar variability as in the case of GFP expression ( Figure 4D).",

            "text": "In fed-batch cultivations, the development of inclusion bodies may be observed by tracking shifts in intrinsic light dispersion via cytometric flow [143]. This enables the growth conditions to be controlled in real time as soon as inclusion bodies are observed even at low rates, and the formation of such bodies may be prevented theoretically [144]. Protein folding involves the presence of a particular cofactor. The addition of such cofactors or binding partners to the culture media may significantly increase the yield of the soluble protein. This phenomenon was demonstrated with a recombinant hemoglobin mutant, resulting in an increased aggregation of the soluble substance upon excessive addition of heme factor [145]. Similarly, a 50% improvement in the solubility of gloshedobin was observed when developed in the E. coli recombinant system with 0.1 mM Mg 2+ [146]. The medium structure and optimization are essential considerations for the soluble expression of recombinant proteins. While this is achieved primarily by trial and error, it can be useful, nonetheless. \n\nThe overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli is commonly employed for manufacturing proteins in significant amounts owing to advantages, such as the development using cheap sources of energy, rapid deposition of biomass, suitability for fermentation with high cell density, and fairly quick output [14]. However, according to the data published by the Center for Eukaryotic Structure Genomics (CESG) (http:/targetdb.pdb.org/statistics/sites/CESG.html), only approximately 30% of the cloned targets in E. coli, among the total of 8048 targets, were presented in a soluble form, while the rest were presented either in a deteriorated form or as insoluble aggregates, classified as inclusion bodies [147]. While inclusion bodies cannot be used specifically for experiments involving protein activity, their insolubility offers a simple source of fairly pure protein, provided only certain proteins can be transformed to their natural and active conformation.",

            "text": "Proteins are now widely produced in diverse microbial cell factories. The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins of interest. One of the major concerns in the overproduction process is the formation of insoluble structures called inclusions bodies (IB) [1,2]. IB formation results from the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides that have escaped quality control by chaperones and proteases to interact through their exposed hydrophobic regions before precipitating [3]. Aggregate formation and features are influenced by various growth conditions such as temperature and pH [4], culture phase [5] and glucose/oxygen availability [6].\n\nIn vivo protein aggregation is a dynamic reversible process [7]. Chaperones involved in aggregate dissociation, e.g. DnaK/DnaJ/ClpB and IbpA/IbpB, colocalize with IB in E. coli [8][9][10][11]. Recently, it has been reported that aggregate cellular localization is not random [9]. Small protein aggregates are delivered to a cell pole to form larger structures that are further dissolved by an energy dependent process [12]. All proteins in IB were initially considered as unfolded, but it has been shown that some polypeptides inside aggregates are present in an active form [2,13,14]. Several groups reported the formation of \"non-classical\" IB mainly characterized by the presence of folded and soluble recombinant proteins [15,16].\n\nHere, we report a novel example of \"non-classical\" IB that contain folded and soluble recombinant proteins and only transiently interact with the IpbA chaperone.\n\nIndeed, overproduction of Brucella abortus PdhS cytoplasmic histidine kinase [17] in E. coli revealed that PdhS-mCherry fusions were first folded and soluble in aggregates formed during the stationary phase of culture before forming insoluble structures having all the characteristics of \"classical\" IB. These \"classical\" IB recruited IpbA-YFP, as previously reported for other IB in E. coli [11], unlike the intermediate \"non classical\" IB. We observed that IbpA-YFP was able to form foci with very dynamic properties inside E. coli and",

            "text": "The expression of recombinant protein is an expanding field in biochemistry, providing various in-depth studies on protein expression and exhibits practical application in diagnostic, therapeutic, or other industrial use [1,2]. Among other expression hosts, Escherichia coli remain the preferable choice due to its ability to reach high-cell density culture and providing high-protein yield. However, expression in E. coli is lacking in post-translational modification, which become a disadvantage to protein that has pivotal recognition based on posttranslational modification accessories such as glycosylation [3]. Furthermore, protein expression in E. coli tends to produce as inclusion bodies. Formation of inclusion bodies offers advantages in higher quantity of protein target and facilitates convenient isolation, yet it sacrifices the biological activity. Protein in inclusion bodies often found in misfolded form, therefore, refolding was required to rejuvenate its activity [2,[4][5][6][7]. \n\nProtein refolding from inclusion bodies oftenly encompasses addition denaturant and removal of detergent. Denaturants such as guanidinium chloride or urea were added in solubilization of inclusion bodies, which helps misfolded protein revert back to its linear form. Later, removal of detergent helps to induce protein refolding [8]. The most common conventional methods in protein refolding include dilution and refolding, yet these methods are inexpensive and simple to be applied. Other methods involve chromatographic system, enzymeassisted refolding, immobilization folding catalyst and artificial chaperones, and microfluidic chips were known to help in protein refolding [8][9][10]. However, the major drawback in protein refolding was formation of protein aggregates. Several strategies have been studied to reduce protein aggregates using chemical additives. Amino acids such as proline and arginine (Arg) show ability to inhibit aggregate formation, while polyol such as glycerol or glucose oftenly combined with aggregation inhibitor to stabilize proteins [11]. Challenge in protein refolding escalates while working with cysteinerich proteins.",

            "text": "This system produces large quantities of protein in a shorter period of time and at lower cost. However, the high yield of heterologous protein in E. coli often leads to improper protein folding, which results in insoluble and non-functional proteins that are aggregated in inclusion bodies [8,9]. Even though aggregation of recombinant protein in inclusion bodies provides an easy method for protein isolation and purification, refolding of the recombinant protein in vitro to gain biological activity often presents great challenges [10]. \n\nExtensive efforts have been made to promote the expression of soluble recombinant proteins in E. coli. One strategy is to reduce protein synthesis rate by lowering incubation temperature and inducing pressure [11]. Another widely adapted strategy to improve the solubility of recombinant proteins is to add a fusion tag such as glutathione-s-transferase (GST) [12,13], maltose binding protein (MBP) [14,15], NusA [16], thioredoxin (Trx) [12,17], or small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) [18,19] to the target protein. Fusion tags have been shown to improve protein solubility as well as protein expression level in the E. coli system. However, the formation of inclusion bodies in E. coli is complicated and the mechanism for this formation is not yet clear. For example, when using E. coli as a protein expression system, some eukaryotic proteins are highly likely to aggregate, regardless of the type of fusion tag used to improve protein solubility. This aggregation can lead to cumbersome and challenging procedures for in-vitro refolding. When a protein produced in the prokaryotic system is highly insoluble, the only option to make it soluble is to use a low-yield eukaryotic expression system. However, the low-yield protein will make the downstream protein purification more difficult. \n\nSUMO is a ubiquitin-related protein and regulates the activity of a wide variety of cellular target proteins by covalent modification of the target protein's lysine residues [20].",

            "text": "Different systems expressing periplasmic OPH in Escherichia coli expression systems have been developed using twin-arginine translocation or sec pathway-driven pathways, involving many advantages including simplified downstream processing, enhanced biological activity, conducting in vivo activity assays due to greater access of the targeted protein to the substrate, higher product stability and solubility, N-terminal authenticity of the expressed protein, simpler and cost effective purification due to a lower protein content compared to the cytoplasm, and providing the oxidative environment required for correct protein folding (13)(14)(15). However, the low secretion efficiency, incomplete secretion of recombinant protein, insufficient capacity for secretion of overexpressed recombinant protein, the death of host cells, and proteolytic degradation of the product in E. coli periplasmic expression systems are problematic despite some successful examples (16). The intracellular produc-tion of recombinant proteins in E. coli cytoplasm which is widely used has several advantages over the secretion of recombinant proteins to the periplasm; however, improper folding of many target proteins may occur during this process. \n\nImproper folding often results in the formation of inclusion bodies despite attempts to optimize the growth condition (17). No significant property was detected to recognize those proteins that have tendency to make inclusion bodies. Correct folding of proteins in cytoplasm can be achieved using several methods which are protein-specific, such as culturing at low temperatures, lowering the protein expression. Although the high protein production in the cytoplasm makes the purification of the soluble target proteins difficult, inclusion bodies have several advantages compared to soluble proteins including the higher accumulation in cytoplasm and increased protein yields as they are proteolysis-resistant, which could be isolated by a simple centrifugation step (15). Accordingly, choosing a suitable strategy to produce a recombinant protein is completely protein-specific.",

            "text": "BackgroundProtein over-production in Escherichia coli often results in formation of inclusion bodies (IBs). Some recent reports have shown that the aggregation into IBs does not necessarily mean that the target protein is inactivated and that IBs may contain a high proportion of correctly folded protein. This proportion is variable depending on the protein itself, the genetic background of the producing cells and the expression temperature. In this paper we have evaluated the influence of other production process parameters on the quality of an inclusion bodies protein.ResultsThe present paper describes the recombinant production in Escherichia coli of the flavohemoglobin from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125. Flavohemoglobins are multidomain proteins requiring FAD and heme cofactors. The production was carried out in several different experimental setups differing in bioreactor geometry, oxygen supply and the presence of a nitrosating compound. In all production processes, the recombinant protein accumulates in IBs, from which it was solubilized in non-denaturing conditions. Comparing structural properties of the solubilized flavohemoglobins, i.e. deriving from the different process designs, our data demonstrated that the protein preparations differ significantly in the presence of cofactors (heme and FAD) and as far as their secondary and tertiary structure content is concerned.ConclusionsData reported in this paper demonstrate that other production process parameters, besides growth temperature, can influence the structure of a recombinant product that accumulates in IBs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported example in which the structural properties of a protein solubilized from inclusion bodies have been correlated to the production process design.",

            "text": "The aim of recombinant protein production is to yield high amounts of the desired proteins. As a result the host organism is often forced to produce proteins above the cells physiological capacity. Upon over-expression, a high amount of proteins are constantly formed that cannot be simultaneously processed by the protein synthesis machinery, thus the quality control system is activated [25]. Additionally, E. coli has simple protein folding machinery, which lacks post-translational modifications. Due to the reducing potential of the E. coli cytoplasmic redox state, the production of proteins possessing more disulfide bonds still remains a challenge. The combination of all these factors, together with the exceeded solubility of over-expressed recombinant protein leads to the aggregation of recombinant proteins, which often gives rise to IBs formation. \n\nIBs were for a long time understood as inert deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins in some way separated from the cellular repair mechanism. However, it is now known that protein aggregation into IBs is reversible [26] and dependent on the physiological state of the host organism. IBs are very dynamic structures that are continuously formed in the host cell and simultaneously the proteins are also released from them and refolded or degraded by the cell repair mechanisms [27]. \n\nSince protein aggregates represented an obstacle in recombinant protein production, various mechanisms that would enable production of soluble proteins in bacteria were studied. Yields of soluble protein expression can be increased by chaperone co-expression [28], fusion of target protein with suitable fusion tags [29], choosing appropriate host strain and promoter system or modifying the cultivation conditions (e.g., growth temperature, media composition) [17]. However, studies showed, that protein solubility does not imply protein activity, as large amount of the proteins found soluble in the cytoplasm can be biologically inactive [7,8]. \n\nThe formation of protein aggregates is a self-assembly process in bacterial cells. As there is no compartmentalization, proteins are simultaneously synthesized on multiple locations in the bacterial cytoplasm and various transitional folding states of the target protein are formed (Figure 1).",

Coexpression of folder chaperones such as the DnaK or the GroE system might help in some cases to keep the recombinant proteins soluble (Nishihara et al., 1998). Solubilizing partners are other proteins which are fused to the recombinant proteins and keep the hybrid proteins soluble. When three different proteins known to increase the solubility (maltose-binding protein [MBP], glutathione-Stransferase [GST] and thioredoxin [TRX] were fused to six different recombinant proteins, MBP turned out to be superior (Kapust and Waugh, 1999). \n\nSometimes, it might be desirable to produce recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies. How can active proteins become recovered from aggregates? This involves a fourstep procedure. During the first step, the inclusion bodies are harvested by cell lysis and centrifugation of the cell lysate at 5,000 to 12,000 x g. Under these conditions, the protein aggregates will be present in the pellet. The second step involves solubilization of the inclusion bodies by resuspension of the pellet in a buffer with a denaturant agent such as 6 M guanidinium chloride or 6-8 M urea. During the next step, the solubilized polypeptide chains are purified by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of nonionic denaturants such as urea. The fourth and last step results in in vitro protein folding. Folding can be aided by the addition of low-molecular weight folding enhancers such as 1.0-1.3 M guanidiumchloride, 2 M urea or polyethyleneglycol. If the recombinant protein contains one or more disulfide bonds, generation of native bonds can be sustained by addition of reduced and oxidized glutathione. \n\nDesign of an optimal expression system for E. coli Based on our present knowledge, we can propose the design of an optimal expression system for E. coli.",

These structures are associated with chaperones like IbpA. However, there are reported cases of \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies in which proteins are soluble, folded and active.ResultsWe report that the Brucella abortus PdhS histidine kinase fused to the mCherry fluorescent protein forms intermediate aggregates resembling \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies when overproduced in E. coli, before forming \"classical\" inclusion bodies. The intermediate aggregates of PdhS-mCherry are characterized by the solubility of PdhS-mCherry, its ability to specifically recruit known partners fused to YFP, suggesting that PdhS is folded in these conditions, and the quick elimination (in less than 10 min) of these structures when bacterial cells are placed on fresh rich medium. Moreover, soluble PdhS-mCherry foci do not systematically colocalize with IpbA-YFP, a marker of inclusion bodies. Instead, time-lapse experiments show that IbpA-YFP exhibits rapid pole-to-pole shuttling, until it partially colocalizes with PdhS-mCherry aggregates.ConclusionThe data reported here suggest that, in E. coli, recombinant proteins like PdhS-mCherry may transit through a soluble and folded state, resembling previously reported \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies, before forming \"classical\" inclusion bodies. The dynamic localization of IbpA-YFP foci suggests that the IbpA chaperone could scan the E. coli cell to find its substrates.",

            "text": "A model suggesting that a folding intermediate is responsible for inclusion body formation has been proposed by Mitraki and King (12). Such a kinetic competition between the folding pathway and an aggregation reaction has previously been recognized as a major determinant for apparent irreversibility in refolding studies in vitro (13). Since aggregation is a second (or higher) order process, it can be much faster than first-order folding and therefore, at high protein concentrations, aggregation dominates over folding and leads to the formation of insoluble protein (14). The observation that temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutations in the tailspike protein of phage P22 increased the fraction of newly synthesized tailspike chains forming aggregates demonstrated the importance of folding intermediates in the mechanism of inclusion body formation (15). The tsf mutations prevent formation of the native protein at the restrictive temperature, but once folded at a lower permissive temperature, the mutant tailspike proteins have stabilities similar to that of the native protein. Intragenic suppressors of these mutations inhibit aggregation of folding intermediates and increase the folding efficiency of tsf mutants (16). Mutations influencing inclusion body formation were also identified for human interleukin-1\u2424, expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli (17). The mutated residues were mainly located either in a \u2424 strand or in a flexible loop. However, there was no strong correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the mutant interleukin-1\u2424 proteins and their tendency to form inclusion bodies. Another example of studies of inclusion body formation in E. coli is provided by the enzyme \u2424-lactamase (18). In the case of such an exported protein, the formation of inclusion bodies depends on the protein synthesis rate and the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide (19). High level of expression of \u2424-lactamase resulted in the accumulation of precursor chains: aggregation occurred both in the cytoplasm from the precursor and in the periplasm from the mature \u2424-lactamase. Despite the widespread reports of inclusion body formation resulting from very high level production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, there is little information on the molecular basis governing this process.",

This over expression is not always well tolerated by the metabolic system of the host and in some situations a cellular stress response is encountered. One phenomenon to be avoided during over expression is the accumulation of over expressed proteins into insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies. These aggregated proteins are in general misfolded and thus biologically inactive. This can be avoided in part by slowing down expression rate using low temperatures, indeed, the expression and activity of a number of E. coli chaperones is increased at 30 \u2022 C [54,55] hence increasing protein folding efficiency and reducing precipitation into inclusion bodies. Expression can also be slowed by induction with low concentrations of isopropyl \u2424-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used as an integral host for production of recombinant proteins in biopharmaceutical industry; however, production of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been associated with serious challenges. One major part of challenges is related to the fact that the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli often leads to the formation of misfolded protein aggregates, called inclusion bodies (IBs), mainly because of differences in folding pathways and physicochemical conditions between expression and natural hosts [1]. Although recombinant protein production via inclusion body formation system looks attractive due to attributes such as relatively straightforward IB generation to high yields, good supply of soluble protein after applying a solubilization treatment and potential clear-cut purification of target protein to high purities, IB proteins mostly contain non-functional target proteins which need to be solubilized by denaturants (e.g., high concentrations of chaotropic agents including urea and guanidinium chloride) and then refolded to functional (bioactive) counterparts [2,3]. The solubilization of IBs protein by denaturation is a simple process; however, the successful recovery of correctly-folded bioactive proteins from completely-denatured IB proteins is often a difficult step. For instance, large-scale refolding of recombinant streptokinase (rSK) from IBs separated from E. coli cells and solubilized in 4 M urea has led to a final product with biological activity much lower than the natural protein (i.e., the protein obtained from betahemolytic streptococci) [3].\n\nDue to the inefficiency of the aforementioned route of production for most proteins prone to forming IBs, directing such proteins into the periplasmic space (the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membrane) of E. coli has been considered as a potent alternative route of production [4,5]. Nevertheless, recombinant protein expression in the periplasm has been also come across with serious problems, relevant to the stress on the bacterial cells during cultivation process in bioreactor.

            "text": "Poor product quality is a common event in the biological synthesis of target proteins and a major cause for recombinant enzymes and pharmaceuticals to be excluded from the market [1]. Recombinant protein misfolding and the triggering of the consequent cell responses are both general events among microbial cell factories [2]. Although what protein quality means might be highly controversial [3][4][5], it is in general assumed that the soluble protein version, despite the potential occurrence of soluble aggregates [4,[6][7][8][9][10] and the presence of functional protein species in protein aggregates [4,[11][12][13][14][15], is the most desirable form of the final product of a protein production process. Traditionally, gaining solubility has been approached by tuningdown the production rate (e.g. by decreasing temperature), reducing recombinant gene dosage or the strength of the promoter, or supplying additional amounts of host chaperones, as they are seen as limiting during the overproduction of misfolding-prone protein species [16,17]. \n\nUnder the high substrate load context of recombinant cells, chaperones, main players in the quality control system, might be over-titrated and therefore their protein targets excluded from folding pathways leading to the native conformation, accumulating as refractile particles called inclusion bodies (IBs) [13,18]. Therefore, several individual chaperones or chaperone sets have been selected for overproduction along with the target recombinant protein. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), most of these approaches have involved the two main cytosolic chaperones, namely DnaK and GroEL, as well as some of their co-chaperones [6,19]. However, the fine examination of physiological responses to protein production in bacteria and other microorganisms [2,10,[20][21][22], has revealed that chaperone co-production, as a quality-addressed strategy, might eventually show undesirable side effects regarding protein yield and quality (Table 1).",

In the case of both rGALNSopt and rGALNSoptGly, the highest specific activities in the intra and extracellular fractions were obtained with 0.1 mM of IPTG and 37 \u2022 C (Fig. 2A-D), and only low enzyme activities were observed in the inclusion bodies fraction derived from cultures expressing rGALNSopt (Fig. 2E).It should be noted that rGALNSoptGly activity levels were lower than rGALNSopt regardless of the culture conditions, which was likely due to differences in the E. coli strains used for the production of each protein (i.e., MC4100 gmdkan \u0394waaL and BL21(DE3), respectively).",

However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli. This overview describes variables at each stage of a protein expression experiment that can influence solubility and offers a summary of strategies used to optimize soluble expression in E. coli.

Although a number of general and protein-specific techniques are available, their effectiveness varies widely. We report a novel method for enhancing the solubility of overexpressed proteins. Presence of a dipeptide, glycylglycine, in the range of 100 mM to 1 M in the medium was found to significantly enhance the solubility (up to 170-fold) of the expressed proteins. The method has been validated using mycobacterial proteins, resulting in improved solubilization, which were otherwise difficult to express as soluble proteins in E. coli.

Escherichia coli is considered the workhorse for this purpose, given its fast growth rate and feasible manipulation. However, bacterial inclusion body formation remains a challenge for further protein purification. We analyzed and optimized the expression conditions for three different proteins: an anti-MICA scFv, MICA, and p19 subunit of IL-23. We used a response surface methodology based on a three-level Box-Behnken design, which included three factors: post-induction temperature, post-induction time and IPTG concentration. Comparing this information with soluble protein data in a principal component analysis revealed that insoluble and soluble proteins have different optimal conditions for post-induction temperature, post-induction time, IPTG concentration and in amino acid sequence features. Finally, we optimized the refolding conditions of the least expressed protein, anti-MICA scFv, using a fast dilution protocol with different additives, obtaining soluble and active scFv for binding assays. These results allowed us to obtain higher yields of proteins expressed in inclusion bodies. Further studies using the system proposed in this study may lead to the identification of optimal environmental factors for a given protein sequence, favoring the acceleration of bioprocess development and structural studies.",

            "text": "Bacteria are simple and cost effective systems for producing recombinant proteins. However, the over-expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria often generates misfolded proteins, which form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm [10]. As more applications require higher amounts of high-quality recombinant proteins, new systems and refinements to recombinant protein expression have been developed, notably simultaneous over-expression of chaperones for proper folding and solubility of generated proteins during expression [19]. For example, an established strategy to overcome the formation of inclusion bodies is to introduce a chaperone that helps solubilize the recombinant proteins [19]. Different proteins have been observed to interact with prion protein [20], namely, molecular chaperones from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as Pdia3, Grp58, and Hsp60 [20][21][22]. This is suggestive of an important role for molecular chaperones in early protein folding. Most of these chaperones possess protein disulfide isomerase-like properties or folding activities [23]. In the ER, disulfide bond formation is catalyzed by Ero1 and the PDI [24,25]. The over-expression of the molecular chaperones (GroELS, Skp or trigger factor) and isomerase (DsbC) has been shown to significantly increase the production yield of recombinant disulfide bond-containing antibodies [26]. Indeed, we have previously observed that co-expression of the chaperone QSOX prevents human or mouse PrP from aggregation by producing soluble PrP in E. coli [13]. \n\nIn bacteria, correct oxidative protein folding depends on both the disulfide bond protein A and B (DsbA/ DsbB) pathway, which catalyzes disulfide bond formation and disulfide bond isomerization [11]. In eukaryotes, ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1) and the protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) catalyze the equivalent reactions in the ER.",

These over-expressed proteins in an insoluble form are termed as inclusion bodies. Since the refolding procedure of inclusion bodies to recover a soluble form of recombinant proteins is time-consuming, expression of insoluble protein aggregates is frequently a major obstacle in recombinant protein production.\n\nHence, to meet the demands of preventing inclusion body formation in recombinant expression systems, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to optimize the growth conditions, such as buffer composition, protein concentration, and cultivation temperature. While others have focused on improving the folding probabilities regarding enhancement of mRNA stability, over-expression of rare-codon tRNA, selection of efficient vectors and host strains, and co-expression with solubility-enhanced proteins [3]. Nevertheless, more studies have emphasized the importance of increasing the solubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli by fusing them to highly soluble carrier proteins [9][10][11][12]. Because the only way to select a specific match between a target protein and an appropriate fusion partner that will lead to a soluble form is still a trial-anderror process; a more systematic approach is required.\n\nRegardless of fusing different vectors, most previous works have attempted to predict the propensity of a given protein to be soluble or not in E. coli. The first such study was conducted by Wilkinson and Harrison [13] with a regression model analysis. They concluded five amino acid-dependent factors are discriminative features that correlate to inclusion bodies formation. There were charge average approximation (Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg), turn-forming residue fraction (Asn, Gly, Pro and Ser), cysteine and proline fractions, hydrophilicity and molecular weight. In a subsequent study, Davis et al. have improved the statistical solubility model of solubility in E. coli by demonstrating that the first two parameters were more critical than other three [14]. Additionally, based on the undertaking of structural genomics projects, Bertone et al. have applied machine learning techniques such as decision trees and Support",

            "text": "Functional expression of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic hosts is of considerable industrial interest, with applications ranging from therapeutic proteins and recombinant enzyme production to metabolic engineering for synthesizing value-added biomolecules [1,2]. However, recombinant protein overexpression in prokaryotic hosts commonly results in protein aggregate formations, termed inclusion bodies [3], which far exceed the host folding capacity. Accordingly, costly and time-consuming in-vitro refolding processes have been widely applied to recover functionally active proteins in their soluble forms. Furthermore, inclusion body formation is generally harmful to the host through increased cellular metabolic burden and intermolecular interactions with other cellular components [4,5], reducing cell viability and overall production yield. \n\nIn vivo and in vitro strategies to solubilize recombinant proteins to an active conformation during the initial production process [6] include solubility-enhancing tags to intrinsically prevent misfolded protein formation in-vivo [7][8][9], physicochemical condition modification to balance translational and folding processes [10,11], and molecular chaperone overexpression to improve host disaggregation and folding capacity [12][13][14]. Molecular chaperones, which can assist cells in coping with stress-induced protein denaturation [15,16], constitute powerful tools to produce functionally active and water-soluble recombinant proteins. Among the options, the use of molecular chaperones is more cost-effective and less time-consuming as no post-translational processing and compromises in cell growth conditions are required. However, straightforward native chaperone co-overexpression with target proteins yields only limited solubilization during recombinant protein production. Although abundant molecular chaperones may be available through the chaperone co-expression approaches, these may not effectively diffuse through the crowded cytosol to interact in a timely fashion with a nascent polypeptide before the mis-foldings happen [17].",

            "text": "There are two ways to achieve these goals: one is to develop methods for converting insoluble denatured recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein to a soluble active form; the other is to change growth conditions to make cells produce active soluble recombinant protein. \n\nRecovery of active recombinant protein from the inclusion body complexes has long been regarded as a formidable task due to the denaturation of the protein and the heterogeneous nature of inclusion bodies (29). Although general techniques for obtaining active recombinant protein from inclusion bodies have not been developed, some success has been reported (30 -32). In these cases, recombinant protein aggregates were solubilized with a high concentration of urea, or other chaotropic reagents, and followed by dialysis, to allow proper refolding of the protein structure (32). When insoluble aggregates of recombinant GST-QPc were treated with 8 M urea, about 75% of the fusion protein was solubilized. However, when the urea was removed by dialysis, more than 95% of the protein precipitated. When the remaining soluble protein was applied to a glutathione agarose gel, no protein was bound to the gel, indicating that the GST-active structure had not properly re-folded. The failure to regenerate active soluble recombinant GST-QPc from inclusion bodies by the urea-dialysis method suggests that this approach is difficult or impossible for GST-QPc fusion protein. Therefore, development of an environment conducive to production of active, soluble GST-QPc recombinant protein by E. coli was necessary if the pGEX/glutathione agarose system was to work for this investigation. \n\nChanges in cellular environments are known to increase the yield of active recombinant protein either by encouraging the cells to adopt the active conformation or by increasing the stability of recombinant proteins. Variation of media, induction conditions, and length of induction are factors that affect the cellular environments of E. coli. We systematically examined the effect of these factors on the yield of soluble recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein.",

            "text": "It is possibly for this reason that co-expression of certain recombinant proteins with supplemented E. coli chaperones does not always yield positive outcomes. For instance, de Marco and co-workers [20] reported that only 26 of the 50 target proteins that were co-overproduced with supplemented E. coli chaperones showed enhanced solubility and improved yields. Altogether, this suggests that E. coli chaperones may not be acquiescent to facilitate folding of certain recombinant proteins, especially those of eukaryotic origin. For this reason, it has been proposed that rehosting the E. coli protein folding landscape by matching chaperones and target proteins from the same species for co-expression in E. coli could improve yields and quality of recombinant proteins [3]. Since production of malarial proteins in E. coli is problematic, this approach may possibly assist. Indeed, a previous study demonstrated that the co-expression of PfHsp70 with another plasmodial protein, PfGCHI, improved the solubility and functional status of the latter [4]. In the current study we investigated the merit of the chimeric Hsp70, KPf, as a chaperone co-expression partner towards improving the quality of recombinant PfAdoMetDC produced in E. coli. Our study further investigated the effect of co-expressing PfAdoMetDC with combinations of supplemented chaperones from both E. coli and P. falciparum. Our findings indicate that supplementation of chaperones of plasmodial origin improves the quality and stability of recombinant malarial proteins produced in E. coli. We discuss our findings with respect to their application in recombinant protein biotechnology and their impact on our understanding of protein folding in E. coli.",

Escherichia coli is an easily cultured organism often used for recombinant protein production; however, the quantity obtained of a soluble, folded, and functional protein-of-interest is often undesirably low, because many proteins-of-interest aggregate to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm when overexpressed. 1 This happens because the innate E. coli proteostasis network capacity is insufficient to support the efficient folding of large quantities of a protein-of-interest as well as the endogenous proteome during bacterial cell growth. Therefore, one potentially general strategy to improve recombinant protein production is to enhance the E. coli's proteostasis network capacity to facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins during their overexpression, without compromising the folding of the endogenous proteome. 2,3 \u22127 Overexpression of select proteostasis network components, such as the molecular chaperones (DnaK), and/or co-chaperones (DnaJ and GrpE), and/or chaperonins (GroEL and GroES), either alone or in combination, effectively increases the biosynthetic yield of certain proteins-of-interest. 8\u221211 However, this approach is limited\ue0d5individual chaperones often handle specific protein substrates, 12,13 making it difficult to predict a priori a suitable chaperone system for a specific protein. \u221213 The E. coli cytosolic proteostasis network is transcriptionally regulated by the heat-shock response (HSR) stress-responsive signaling pathway. 14 \u221218 The HSR transcriptional program is controlled by the transcriptional factor \u03c332, 19 whose induction through stress has been shown to elevate the mRNA and protein levels of the majority of proteostasis network components. 20",

The aggregation of insoluble polypeptide chains as inclusion bodies has seriously restricted the spectrum of proteins marketed by the biotechnology industry. Being widespreadly believed that inclusion body proteins are biologically inactive and therefore useless in bioprocesses, many aggregation-prone products have been disregarded for commercialisation. Protein solubility can be tailored by either process [2] or protein [3] engineering, although most efforts have been addressed to minimize inclusion body formation by co-production of folding modulators [4], or to refold purified inclusion body proteins by chemical denaturation followed by refolding procedures [5]. Both strategies need to be adapted to particular protein species and they render largely variable results regarding the final soluble protein yield.\n\nInterestingly, independent reports have noted enzymatic activity associated to inclusion bodies formed by recombinant enzymes [6][7][8], but the extent of these side-observations has been never quantified and its biological and biotechnological relevance remained unexplored. In this work, we have quantitatively explored the biological activity of inclusion body recombinant proteins and their potential use for bioprocesses in the aggregated form.",

The data, presented in Figure 3B, revealed that lower numbers of targets were obtained from genes synthesized artificially (p = 0.04). Several studies have demonstrated that codon optimization for heterologous production in E. coli can potentially increase recombinant protein expression, especially in sequences of eukaryotic and archaeal origin [23][24][25][26]. However, other studies revealed that E. coli codon optimization may lead to overexpression of recombinant proteins, thus resulting in a higher tendency to generate insoluble inclusion bodies [27,28]. The formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant expression systems occurs as a result of an imbalance between in vivo protein folding and aggregation [29][30][31]. The data presented here revealed that although the number of obtained proteins was reduced when genes were obtained synthetically, a significant proportion of non-viable targets revealed high levels of expression in the form of inclusion bodies (data not shown). Therefore, we can conclude that E. coli codon optimization increased the levels of recombinant protein expression. However, for some proteins, higher levels of expression were beyond E. coli's capacity to provide proper folding and led to the accumulation of the recombinant proteins in the form of insoluble aggregates. These targets may require further testing of the expression conditions (different strains and simpler media, such as LB).",

            "text": "Folding failures of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is generally attributed to a limitation in the cell concentration of folding assistant elements, which cannot process the newly synthesized aggregation prone polypeptides. This assumption is physiologically supported by the overexpression of chaperone genes, in particular of chaperone genes from the heat-shock protein family, in response to recombinant protein overproduction [126,127,133]. Thus, coproduction of the main heat shock chaperones (specially GroEL and DnaK) together with the target protein has been largely explored as a way to minimize aggregation and to enhance the solubility of the recombinant protein product (reviewed in [140][141][142][143]). In many cases, solubility has been significantly enhanced by coexpression of individual chaperone genes, while in others an even negative effect on product stability and host viability has been observed. Selection of the suitable chaperone(s) is still a trial-and-error process. However, more recent results indicate that complete chaperones gene sets rather than individual chaperone genes with synergistic and/or cooperative activities (such as DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES sets) will lead to a more predictable improvement of target protein solubility. [144][145][146][147].\n\nInterestingly, when producing enzymes or fluorescent proteins in DnaKcells, the biological activities and therefore the conformational quality of aggregated polypeptides is much more close to that of soluble versions, compared to wild type cells [148][149][150]. Furthermore, the overexpression of the dnaK gene along with a model GFP recombinant protein dramatically reduces the specific fluorescence of a GFP fusion in both soluble and insoluble versions [151]. This indicates that DnaK directly or indirectly impairs the folding state of the aggregated proteins.\n\nIn this regard, the production of GFP variants in absence of DnaK results in highly fluorescent inclusion bodies [152]. In these cells, both the protein yield and quality were dramatically enhanced although the solubility is lower than in the wild type, as expected",

There are several disadvantages with this system, however, especially for the expression of eukaryotic proteins. For example, when randomly selected 2,078 full-length genes of Caenorhabditis elegans were expressed in E. coli cytoplasm, only 11% of genes yielded significant amounts of soluble material [1]. Several different approaches have been taken to resolve the solubility problem in the past and include (1) truncation of long multi-domain proteins into short and separate domains [2] ; (2) co-expression of molecular chaperones or foldases [3]; (3) enabled secretion to the periplasm where disulfide bonds can be properly formed with the help of an oxidative environment and Dsb protein families [4]; (4) co-expression of aminoacyl tRNA cognates to amino acids encoded by rare codons [5]; and more recently (5) use of a fusion expression partner [6,7]. The most efficient method for enhancing solubility and folding efficiencies of recombinant proteins appears to be the latter (fusion expression partners) which includes maltose binding protein (MBP) [8], thioredoxin (Trx) [9], human ferritin heavy chains (hFTN-H) [10], and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) [11]. Although these fusion partners have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility and folding of some recombinant proteins [12], they likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. Thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining.\n\nIn the present study, we found that the level of RpoS significantly increased during the stress caused by guanidine hydrochloride through proteome-wide mining involving the stress response of E. coli BL21(DE3). As an N-terminus fusion expression partner, RpoS dramatically increased the solubility of the following heterologous proteins (human minipro-insulin",

The experiments of this study could not confirm degradation by bacterial proteases as one of the major causes, since the use of a protease inhibitor cocktail in the purification protocol did not affect the pattern of the expressed products (data not shown). In addition, expression was carried out using a BL21 Codon Plus bacterial strain (Stratagene) that is deficient in the OmpT and Lon bacterial proteases.\n\nWe have previously found that a large proportion of the recombinant proteins remain in the insoluble fraction whereas only small amounts appear in the soluble fraction (Figure 2 and data not shown) if expression is initiated at an OD A 600 of 0.6. To check whether the bacterial growth status at the induction timepoint has any effect on protein solubility, induction of expression was carried out on aliquots of the same bacterial stock culture at different bacterial densities (OD A 600 value). Both soluble and insoluble fractions of the same culture were compared.\n\nThe results (Figure 2A-C) clearly show that the majority of the three recombinant proteins remain in the insoluble fraction when the expression was induced at an OD A 600 below 2.0. If, on the other hand, the induction is initiated at an OD A 600 greater than 2.0, almost the total amount of the recombinant proteins appears in the soluble fraction.\n\nThe solubility of a protein correlates with its correct structure that is formed during a post-translational folding process. Freshly synthesized polypeptides remain in a stage of intermediate form in the bacterial cytoplasma. After several enzymatic and biochemical processing steps, the peptides are folded into their functional form [24]. However, if proteins are folded incorrectly, they tend to accumulate as aggregates in the bacterial cell and, in order to avoid toxic effects on the host system, the bacteria store these aggregates in confined structures referred to as inclusion bodies.",

Evidence had been presented that the majority of the expressed recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) formed aggregates (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) leading to inclusion body formation in the reducing environment of the E. coli cytosol [17,18]. Recovery of functional protein from inclusion bodies in vitro is a difficult, time-consuming, laborious and expensive task for such a multidomain and disulfide bond rich protein. Because of such limitations, E. coli as a host system was neglected for rHSA production. Therefore, designing advanced strategies to obtain protein in soluble form in vivo could bypass the tedious in vitro refolding strategies. \n\nAfter considering the advantages of E. coli as a host, the present work has targeted E. coli as an alternate host system for rHSA production through resolving the major issue of inclusion body formation associated with it. \n\nIn the present communication, we have demonstrated the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of HSA. Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction and cell lysis conditions etc., play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form have been optimized. We have studied the effect of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. We have also examined different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in the presence and absence of exogenous molecular chaperones-GroEL-ES and trigger factor (TF). \n\nHere, we are reporting the development of a simple, novel and innovative method for enhanced soluble and functional production of rHSA in E. coli.

            "text": "The bacterium Escherichia coli is a major host for recombinant protein production of non-glycosylated products. Depending on the expression strategy, the recombinant protein can be located intracellularly, which often leads to protein aggregates inside of the cytoplasm, forming so the called inclusion bodies (IBs). When compared to other protein expression strategies, inclusion body formation allows high product titers and also the possibility of expressing proteins being toxic for the host. In the past years, the comprehension of inclusion bodies being only inactive protein aggregates changed, and the new term of non-classical inclusion bodies emerged. These inclusion bodies are believed to contain a reasonable amount of active protein within their structure. However, subsequent downstream processing, such as homogenisation of cells, centrifugation or solubilisation of IBs, is prone to variable process performance and is often known to result in low extraction yields. It is hypothesised that variations in IB quality attributes are responsible for those effects and that such attributes can be controlled by upstream process conditions. In this review, we address the impact of process design (process parameters) in the upstream on defined inclusion body quality attributes. The following topics are therefore addressed: (i) an overview of the range of inclusion body applications (including emerging technologies); (ii) analytical methods to determine quality attributes; and (iii) screws in process engineering to achieve the desired quality attributes for different inclusion body\u2013based applications. Process parameters in the upstream can be used to trigger different quality attributes including protein activity, but are not exploited to a satisfying content yet. Design by quality approaches in the upstream are already considered for a multitude of existing processes. Further intensifying this approach may pave the industrial application for new IB-based products and improves IB processing, as discussed within this review.",

Although these fusion proteins overexpressed in E. coli were enzymatically active in both soluble and insoluble (aggregate) fractions. The present paper thus delineates the proteomic profiles of overproducing bacteria and presents results that could be useful for conceive a strategy to improve the production of soluble recombinant proteins. \n\nRecombinant protein overexpression has been known to induce significant physiological changes such as the stress response to heat-shock in E. coli [6]. The presence of the inducer isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) alone can even influence E. coli metabolism substantially, altering the synthesis of certain proteins [7]. When a recombinant protein is expressed at high rates, the system of cytosolic chaperones and proteases in bacteria is presumably induced to express in an altered pattern, in comparison with the host cells without overexpressing recombinant proteins. In addition to facilitating the folding of nascent proteins, several molecular chaperones and heat shock proteins are induced to inhibit the formation of inclusion bodies by reducing aggregation and promoting proteolysis of misfolded proteins. The simultaneous overexpression of chaperone/ heat shock protein encoding genes and recombinant target proteins proved effective in several instances [8]. To increase the solubility of recombinant proteins, the cooverproduction of individual chaperones as well as the combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol has been attempted [9]. Based on experimental results, Garcia-Fruitos et al. suggested that the so-called E. coli quality control system (made up of chaperones and proteases) acts coordinately to promote solubility at the expense of conformational quality [10]. A study of global changes in protein expression that occur in response to the rapid synthesis of a recombinant protein would therefore help to elucidate the mechanisms regulating recombinant protein solubility.",

            "text": "Background During the recombinant protein expression, most heterologous proteins expressed in E. coli cell factories are generated as insoluble and inactive aggregates, which prohibit E. coli from being employed as an expression host despite its numerous advantages and ease of use. The yeast mitochondrial aconitase protein, which has a tendency to aggregate when expressed in E. coli cells in the absence of heterologous chaperones GroEL/ES was utilised as a model to investigate how the modulation of physiological stimuli in the host cell can increase protein solubility. The presence of folding modulators such as exogenous molecular chaperones or osmolytes, as well as process variables such as incubation temperature, inducer concentrations, growth media are all important for cellular folding and are investigated in this study. This study also investigated how the cell's stress response system activates and protects the proteins from aggregation. Results The cells exposed to osmolytes plus a pre-induction heat shock showed a substantial increase in recombinant aconitase activity when combined with modulation of process conditions. The concomitant GroEL/ES expression further assists the folding of these soluble aggregates and increases the functional protein molecules in the cytoplasm of the recombinant E. coli cells. Conclusions The recombinant E. coli cells enduring physiological stress provide a cytosolic environment for the enhancement in the solubility and\u00a0activity of the recombinant proteins. GroEL/ES-expressing cells not only aided in the folding of recombinant proteins, but also had an effect on the physiology of the expression host. The improvement in the specific growth rate and aconitase production during chaperone GroEL/ES co-expression is attributed to the reduction in overall cellular stress caused by the expression host's aggregation-prone recombinant protein expression.

            "text": "Rapid production of recombinant proteins can lead to the formation of insoluble aggregates designated as inclusion bodies (Betts and King, 1999). These are large, spherical particles which are clearly separated from the cytoplasm and result from the failure of the quality control system to repair or remove misfolded or unfolded protein. \n\nThe formation of inclusion bodies does not correlate with (1) the size of the synthesized polypeptide, (2) the use of the fusion construct, (3) the subunit structure and (4) the relative hydrophobicity of the recombinant protein. Overproduction by itself (the increase in the concentration of the nascent polypeptide chains) can be sufficient to induce the formation of inclusion bodies. These aggregates do not consist of pure recombinant polypeptide chains, but contain several impurities such as host proteins (RNA polymerase, outer membrane proteins), ribosomal components and circular and nicked forms of plasmid DNA. In addition, they might contain the small heat shock proteins IbpA and IbpB. Strategies to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies are aimed to slow down the production of recombinant proteins and include (1) low-copy number vectors, (2) weak promoters, (3) low temperature, (4) coexpression of molecular chaperones, (5) use of a solubilizing partner, and (6) fermentation at extreme pH values. \n\nA lower level of protein synthesis from a weaker promoter or from a strong promoter under conditions of partial induction is found to result in a higher amount of soluble protein and greater specific activity (Hockney, 1994). Growth at lower temperatures is a well known technique for facilitating correct folding. The reason why a lower temperature favors the native state is related to a number of factors, including a decrease in the driving force for protein self-association, a slower rate of protein synthesis, changes in the folding kinetics of the polypeptide chain, etc. We have mentioned an expression system which is specifically induced at low temperature, and together with the molecular chaperones derived from the Antarctic seawater bacterium, it may create a new and powerful system to obtain correctly folded proteins.",

            "text": "Indeed, this is a major problem with expressing human proteins in bacteria, as the proteins are misfolded and aggregate, preventing the production of a functional eukaryotic protein [17][18][19][20]. As a result, various methods have been established to overcome insolubility issues: fusion tags and growth temperature, auto-induction and purification conditions have all been optimized to improve the solubility of proteins expressed in Escherichia coli [21][22][23]. Moreover, various types of folding aids are employed in bacterial systems. E. coli molecular chaperones, e.g., GroES and GroEL, have shown to promote protein folding when co-expressed with human aromatase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes [24,25]. Additionally, it has been proven that including some chemical chaperones, e.g., polyols, amino acids and polyethylene glycol, in the growth medium is beneficial for producing soluble and functional proteins [26][27][28]. However, when the aforementioned methods are unsuccessful and the protein is still mainly expressed as inclusion bodies, efficient protocols for refolding proteins is, therefore, necessary to produce biologically active proteins, which will be advantageous for structural and functional studies. Many effective protocols for refolding proteins from inclusion bodies have been established and proven to successfully produce active enzymes. The refolding of proteins can mainly be achieved in two different ways: dialysis and dilution. During the refolding process, chemical chaperons or additives are usually added to assist in protein conformation, and additives such as trehalose, glycerol, sorbitol, arginine and sucrose have been reported to be advantageous for the refolding step [17][18][19][29][30][31][32][33]. \n\nIn the present study, we report the heterologous expression of CES1 in E. coli, in which it was mainly expressed in inclusion bodies. Thereafter, different refolding conditions were applied to retain the catalytically active enzyme.",

            "text": "Proper folding of proteins to maintain enough solubility and homeostasis is essential for nearly every protein-based biological process. Unsatisfied solubility or aggregation can impede proteinbased drug development, such as antibody production. The low solubility of antibodies may limit their shelf-life and potentially induce adverse immune responses [1][2][3]. Apart from antibodies, more and more enzymes of interest (EOI) are being discovered with an increasing speed due to the decreasing cost of sequencing and gene synthesis as well as continuous improvement of highthroughput functional screening platforms [4][5][6]. In these largescale EOI screening studies, enhancing the accuracy of protein solubility prediction can improve the success rate of protein purification and facilitate the downstream biophysical or biochemical characterization. Common hosts such as bacterial cells, insect cells, yeast cells, plant cells, and mammalian cells are often used for recombinant protein expression [7]. Among these options, bacterial cells, typically Escherichia coli, provide the advantages of easy genetic manipulation and cost-effectiveness, therefore serving as one of the major platforms for recombinant protein production [8]. Improving the accuracy of protein solubility prediction in E. coli thus has great potential to reduce experimental cost and increase the success rate of novel EOI discovery. \n\nProtein solubility in E. coli is a complex issue inf luenced by numerous factors at different levels. Firstly, regarding the sequence level, several attributes have been identified as pivotal determinants of solubility, encompassing the composition of specific amino acids (Asn, Thr, Tyr), the frequency of tripeptides [9], and the ratio of charged amino acids on the protein surface [10,11]. Secondly, during the protein expression process, the ineffective translation of the mRNA and the manifestation of protein toxicity to E. coli may impede normal growth. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that protein instability can lead to aggregation, thereby inducing the formation of inclusion bodies [12][13][14].",

Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within the producing bacteria. We evaluated how the initial culture density, temperature and duration of the expression stage affect the production of some eukaryotic enzymes in E. coli.FindingsA high yield of active soluble proteins was obtained by combining early-log phase cultures and low temperatures for protein induction. When IPTG was added at OD600\u2009=\u20090.1 and cultures were maintained at 4\u00b0C for 48-72\u00a0h, the soluble protein yield was 3 fold higher than that obtained in the mid-log phase (OD600\u2009=\u20090.6). Besides, the target protein expression increased and the endogenous bacterial proteins reduced, thus making the protein purification process easier and more efficient.ConclusionsThe protocol can be widely applied to proteins with a heterologous expression which was limited by loss of activity at high temperatures or by low soluble recombinant protein yield.",

            "text": "However, the periplasmic expression of recombinant proteins has two major drawbacks of low yield and frequent aggregation. Alternatively, the production of domain antibodies using fusion constructs in tandem with a stretch of amino acid (peptide tag) or a large polypeptide (Thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and maltose-binding protein (MBP) has been demonstrated in bacterial periplasmic and cytoplasmic systems [8]. Unfortunately, the reducing environment in the cytoplasmic region remains a limiting factor for the folding of the majority of cysteine rich proteins such as antibodies. An approach to overcome the shortcoming is to express the antibodies in the cytoplasm of mutant E. coli strains that provide an oxidizing environment. However, often, the formation of a partially folded/misfolded protein is triggered, which is forced to aggregate as non-functional inclusion bodies (IBs) [9]. Largely, cysteine-rich proteins are formed as IBs in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartments of E. coli [10]. Utilizing various strategies for molecular and protein engineering such as gene fusion technology, co-production of chaperones [11], use of engineered host E.coli strains [12], optimizing the growth conditions such as temperature, inducer concentration, and induction time, can often help in increasing the formation of efficient soluble protein production [13]. \n\nRecently, it has been reported that recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the soluble form in the bacterial expression system by adding compatible solutes (chemical additives) such as sorbitol, arginine, and trehalose in the expression medium [14]. Although proteins with disulfide bonds are also found in the cytoplasmic region of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, most of them are transient and involve cysteines located in redox-active sites of enzymes [15]. Both classical and non-classical IBs contain relatively pure and intact recombinant proteins, and several approaches have been reported to recover biologically active proteins from these aggregated forms.",

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein . Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to maximize the efficient production of soluble recombinant proteins in bacteria. A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co-expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in E. coli, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 5.24.1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein.

However, if proteins are folded incorrectly, they tend to accumulate as aggregates in the bacterial cell and, in order to avoid toxic effects on the host system, the bacteria store these aggregates in confined structures referred to as inclusion bodies.\n\nFormation and accumulation of heterologous proteins as inclusion bodies is a common problem in protein expression. The exact mechanism of this process is still not understood. It has been suggested that factors such as culture pH, temperature and protein amino acid composition might affect the solubility of a recombinant protein [24].

The expression of the three recombinant proteins was induced at various timepoints chosen gradually from low OD A 600 to higher OD A 600 . The comparison of the soluble and insoluble fractions of the recombinant proteins revealed that after initiation of expression at an OD A 600 of greater than 2.0, the recombinant proteins are found almost completely in the soluble fraction. The amount of each protein loaded is not proportional to the size of the cultivation.\n\nspeed and, with that, the subsequent folding process is the most important factor. Protein expression at the post-log phase resulted in high amounts of soluble protein, which indicates that at this stage the low bacterial growth rate implicates a biosynthesis process that is kept at low speed. The slow synthesis process will allow the protein processing machinery to efficiently assemble the freshly synthesized peptides into the correct structure. Correctly folded proteins are most likely to stay in the soluble form provided that the molecule does not contain large numbers of hydrophobic residues.\n\nAlthough we found that the pH value of the growing culture is influenced by the amino acid composition of the expressed polypeptide, keeping a stable pH value in the bacterial culture does not affect the protein solubility (data not shown) and, therefore, has little influence on the quality of the expressed protein. However, temperature is an important factor to consider. Keeping the culture at 16\u00b0C before and after induction slightly improves the protein quality (data not shown), but, on the other hand, slows down bacterial growth considerably and therefore",

            "text": "[14].\n\nExpression of heterologous genes especially of malarial origin in E. coli, often results in the accumulation of highly pure recombinant protein in a totally or partially unfolded conformation as insoluble aggregates commonly referred to as inclusion bodies [15]. The major determinants of expression for many proteins are the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of an intermediate, rather than by the solubility and stability of the final state. Many turn-forming residues slow down protein folding, resulting in a high concentration of folding intermediates incompatible with folding rates resulting in aggregation of the protein. Solubility has also been correlated inversely to the hydrophobic nature of the protein [16]. The total charge of the aggregation-prone state of a protein strongly influences its propensity to aggregate. The propensity of charged residues as \"structural gatekeepers\" against aggregation does not, however, appear to be based only on the ability of these residues to interrupt contiguous stretches of hydrophobic residues, but also their ability to generate electrostatic repulsions between protein molecules. The higher the net charge, the higher the repulsion between proteins and hence lower the probability for aggregation. Appropriate interactions involving key residues i.e. cysteine also ensures that a newly synthesized chain of amino acids transforms into a correctly folded protein.\n\nBut the mechanisms by which these residues affect the solubility status of an expressed protein remain to be understood.\n\nBesides, the primary sequence of a protein, a multitude of external parameters such as culture media composition, growth temperature, production rate as a function of plasmid copy, promoter strength, codon usage and mRNA stability, all have a decisive influence on the expression of recombinant proteins. Even if the solubility algorithms predict a particular sequence to be confined to an insoluble state, alterations in these parameters can have an overriding effect on the final outcome [1]. Changing expression hosts can, however, be the preferred alternative to the time consuming and often uncertain option of optimizing physical parameters to obtain soluble protein. In vitro refolding procedures, although specific for each protein, are another useful option to obtain native protein in a non-high throughput setting [17].\n\nAs illustrated in the case of P. falciparum apical membrane antigen 1, rec",

However, overexpression of recombinant protein in E. coli often found as inclusion bodies. While formation of inclusion bodies is beneficial in protein isolation from other cellular components, most of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies are misfolded which have lost their biological activity. Protein refolding allows misfolded protein to rearrange into their native conformation which exhibit its biological activity, thus protein refolding become a pivotal step to recover active protein. However, protein refolding was affected by various factors; hence, screening of refolding condition was required to meet the optimal result. As a consequence, rapid and efficient characterization method is required to monitor the refolding performance.

Nevertheless, in most of the cases part or all of the recombinant protein expressed in bacteria is recovered as precipitates in the inclusion bodies. \n\nBoth amorphous and organized inclusion bodies have been isolated [10]. Their composition varies from almost homogeneous to cases in which 50% of the material is represented by contaminants [11,12]. The structural het-erogeneity of the inclusion bodies has recently been shown [13,14] and it could be a consequence of the variable aggregation pattern to which a single protein can undergo under different conditions [15]. Proteins trapped in the inclusion bodies can be re-solubilised in vivo by impairing the de novo protein synthesis because the block of new protein production makes available larger amounts of chaperones and foldases for refolding precipitated proteins [3]. The temporal separation between recombinant expression of chaperones and target proteins has also been successfully used to improve the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [8]. These results suggest a model for which soluble proteins are in a dynamic equilibrium with aggregates. In conclusion, modifications of the cell conditions can modulate the aggregation rate and the protein aggregation process can be reversed by conditions favorable for the folding machinery. This dynamic view for which proteins can pass from soluble to insoluble and back to soluble state suggests the presence of different degrees of aggregation complexity. Soluble aggregates of recombinant proteins have been described [16,17] and in a recent paper we have shown that the GFP-GST fusion protein expressed in bacteria forms aggregates with an estimated mass ranging from a few hundred kDa to more than 1000 kDa [18]. The separation of the aggregates using a blue native gel electrophoresis followed by SDS-PAGE indicated an almost continuous distribution with few regions of concentrated accumulation.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for the commercial production of therapeutic and industrial recombinant proteins (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004) for several reasons, including low manufacturing costs, rapid product accumulation, and well-established tools for genetic manipulation (Eiteman & Altman, 2006). Despite these advantages, overproduced heterologous proteins in E. coli often form nonproductive inclusion bodies, and fusion expression using solubility enhancer proteins as fusion partner has emerged as an efficient production strategy to overcome the inclusion body formation (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004;S\u00f8rensen & Mortensen, 2005). Currently, Shistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (Smith & Johnson, 1988), E. coli maltose-binding protein (Bach et al., 2001), E. coli N utilization substance A (De Marco et al., 2004) and E. coli thioredoxin (LaVallie et al., 1993) are the most extensively examined fusion partners (Davis et al., 1999;Nallamsetty & Waugh, 2006), but they are not free from proprietary protection upon commercial application. Moreover, the traditional solubility-enhancing fusion partner proteins are not equally effective in promoting the folding of fusion partners (Dyson et al., 2004;Park et al., 2008). In this study, we report a novel and efficient strategy for the synthesis of soluble and correctly folded hG-CSF using various E. coli stress-responsive proteins that we previously found through a proteome-wide analysis of E. coli proteins under 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (2-HEDS)-induced stress condition (Han et al., 2008). Using the six stress-responsive proteins of E. coli, we successfully produced hG-CSF with correct conformation as well as demonstrated using circular dichroism (CD).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli retains its dominant position as the first choice of host for the high-throughput production of proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest because of rapid biomass accumulation, well-established genetic manipulation methods and simple process scale-up [1,2]. However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides [3]. Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding [4]. Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers [5,6]. Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization can dominate the rate and pathway of protein folding and in turn determine the refolding efficiency [7,8].\n\nAt least two classes of cellular factors are currently known to assist in vivo or in vitro protein folding. The first class includes a number of proteins collectively known as \"molecular chaperones\" such as GroEL-GroES and DnaK/ DnaJ/GrpE in E. coli. Molecular chaperones",

            "text": "After protein concentration determination 50 ng/ml of purified \u03b2-NGF was added to PC12 cell line. Commercial \u03b2-NGF (Sigma-USA) was used as control too. As shown in Fig. 4, after 7 days PC12 cells were differentiated to the nerve cells. This indicated that the purified \u03b2-NGF could be fully functional. High level expression and production of recombinant proteins is the goal of many researches. However, this usually leads to the formation of aggregated and misfolded proteins called inclusion body. One of the best strategies to overcome this problem is to use fusion proteins, e. g. DsbA, as used in this research. DsbA is an enzyme that can assist disulfide bond formation in nascent polypeptide chains (Ke & Berkmen, 2014). \n\nAnother strategy for the prevention of inclusion body formation is the co-expression of molecular chaperones. As molecular chaperones are involved in the protein-folding process, their over-expression was usually carried out in order to increase the stability and solubility of the produced target recombinant protein (De Marco et al., 2007;Tegel et al., 2011;Makhoba et al., 2015;Gounel et al., 2016). E. coli cytoplasm involves three chaperone systems: trigger factor, DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES (Voziyan et al., 1998;Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004). Newly-synthesized proteins in bacteria are associated with the chaperone trigger factor as soon as they leave the exit tunnel of the ribosome (Deuerling et al., 1999;Valent et al., 1997;Schaffitzel et al., 2001). The effects of different chaperone teams on protein solubility and folding have been studied in recent researches. For example, in one experiment done by Sia and colleagus, GroEL team and TF increased the production of soluble human-like collagen (HLC) by assisting its correct folding (Jia et al., 2014).",

            "text": "BackgroundEscherichia coli has been most widely used for the production of valuable recombinant proteins. However, over-production of heterologous proteins in E. coli frequently leads to their misfolding and aggregation yielding inclusion bodies. Previous attempts to refold the inclusion bodies into bioactive forms usually result in poor recovery and account for the major cost in industrial production of desired proteins from recombinant E. coli. Here, we describe the successful use of the immobilized folding machineries for in vitro refolding with the examples of high yield refolding of a ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO).ResultsWe have generated refolding-facilitating media immobilized with three folding machineries, mini-chaperone (a monomeric apical domain consisting of residues 191\u2013345 of GroEL) and two foldases (DsbA and human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) by mimicking oxidative refolding chromatography. For efficient and simple purification and immobilization simultaneously, folding machineries were fused with the positively-charged consecutive 10-arginine tag at their C-terminal. The immobilized folding machineries were fully functional when assayed in a batch mode. When the refolding-facilitating matrices were applied to the refolding of denatured and reduced RNase A and CHMO, both of which contain many cysteine and proline residues, RNase A and CHMO were recovered in 73% and 53% yield of soluble protein with full enzyme activity, respectively.ConclusionThe refolding-facilitating media presented here could be a cost-efficient platform and should be applicable to refold a wide range of E. coli inclusion bodies in high yield with biological function.",

            "text": "A widely used approach to protein production is based on the fact that, when a recombinant protein is overexpressed in bacterial cells, it often forms insoluble inclusion bodies that are easy to isolate from other cellular components. Such aggregates of overexpressed proteins can be collected, further purified, denatured in vitro and often can be successfully refolded into soluble, active proteins. Because of the numerous industrial applications, protein purification and refolding from bacterial inclusion bodies have been extensively studied (for overview, see [56][57][58][59]). \n\nIf indeed the proteins that are purified from inclusion bodies were shown to unfold completely and then routinely refold to the native, active conformation, this would comprise strong evidence that spontaneous protein folding is common, in accord with the thermodynamic hypothesis. However, experiments with overexpressed proteins that form inclusion bodies resulted in a key observation that suggests quite different conclusions. Typically, proteins within the aggregates that form the inclusion bodies are neither disordered nor unfolded, but have specific secondary and tertiary structures, which are substantially ordered and are often enriched in in-register beta-sheets [60][61][62][63]. Detailed analysis of the refolding process shows that some of the ordered structure is preserved throughout the purification stages ( [64][65][66], reviewed in [67]). Moreover, harsh denaturing conditions tend to be detrimental for protein refolding to the native conformation, so that new protocols for unfolding-refolding under mild conditions are constantly proposed in attempts to improve the yield of functional proteins (e.g., [68][69][70]). \n\nThus, experiments on refolding of overexpressed proteins demonstrate the key role of the residual secondary and tertiary structures, which are generated in the first place by the cell during protein expression in vivo and apparently have to be retained by the protein for efficient refolding. Furthermore, even when refolding occurs, it barely resembles the folding processes that occur in living cells.",

            "text": "Enzymatic catalysis provides tremendous opportunities for industry to carry out efficient and economical biocatalytic conversions. Traditional markets include the food and feed industry, but enzymatic processes are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as fine chemical production and pharmaceutical industries [1]. Cost-efficient high-yield production of the biocatalysts, usually by heterologous expression in bacterial or yeast systems, is critical for the economic viability of such processes. The choice of the production host depends on several properties of the target protein itself. If posttranslational modifications are not required, prokaryotic systems like E. coli are most attractive due to high productivity, low cost and easy handling. However, overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria can cause problems like the production of insoluble aggregates of misfolded and inactive proteins called inclusion bodies (IB). Inclusion bodies consist of the overproduced polypeptide aggregated with small amounts of foreign proteins and nucleic acids [2]. Strategies for resolving this problem and for optimizing expression levels in E. coli have already been reported [3][4][5][6][7] and include the application of well-characterized expression systems under the control of tightly regulated promoters as well as the application of different expression conditions. In general, reduced cell growth, caused by lowered temperatures or oxygen limitation, promotes the expression of complex heterologous proteins in an active and soluble form and reduces IB formation [8][9][10][11]. Overdrive of inducer, on the other hand, results in IB formation and cell damage, whereas limited induction is favorable for native enzyme production [12]. Refolding of IB is widely discussed in literature [13,14], but is not possible for every given protein. \n\nIn this study we analyzed different expression systems for the production of recombinant pyranose 2-oxidase (POx; pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase; glucose 2-oxidase; EC 1.1.3.10) from Trametes multicolor in the prokaryotic host E. coli.",

            "text": "Proteins are the molecular machineries that possess biological functionality and often find indispensable roles in the fields of cosmetics, biofuels and pharmaceuticals. Owing to the advanced developments in the recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, gene of any length and origin can now be expressed in any of the expression systems like animals, plants and microorganisms. The combination of rDNA technology and the scale-up processes provide a platform for large-scale production of recombinant proteins to meet the growing demands. Among the different expression hosts, E. coli is the most extensively employed prokaryotic expression host, accounting for 30% of all recombinant biopharmaceutical goods approved by the FDA and EMEA [1]. Its properties like faster multiplication rates, growth on cheap substrates, availability of tools for genetic manipulation, etc. favour efficient expression of recombinant proteins at industrial scales [2]. However, high protein expression is not enough, in order to function, the nascent polypeptides have to attain a precise complex structural confirmation by a process called as protein folding. The nascent polypeptides that fail to attain the native three-dimensional structural confirmation are termed as misfolded proteins. Misfolding can result due to mutations in the gene, translational errors, absence of post-translational machinery and other cellular stresses resulting in the loss of protein's native structure [3]. The misfolded proteins lose their functionality and expose the intricate core hydrophobic stretches of residues that are usually buried within the native structure. These exposed hydrophobic protein moieties associate with one another through weak forces of attraction and form aggregates which act as seeding steps for the large-scale aggregation process leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies [3,4]. Without defined techniques for protein refolding, recovery is frequently done on a trial-and-error basis, making protein production a time-consuming and costly process. The propensity of E. coli to generate protein aggregates is an obstacle to its utilisation as a host despite its several advantages.",

            "text": "The chaperone systems most relevant for de novo protein folding include trigger factor (TF), GroEL system, DnaK system, GrpE, and ClpB, each with a distinct but partially overlapping mode of actions. For instance, de novo folding of polypeptides emerging from the ribosome is aided by TF, DnaK system, and subsequently with GroESL system to reach a native conformation (Figure 1C) [19]. In a synthetic biology perspective, this ubiquitous protein folding machinery is an important molecular asset to tackle the problem in heterologous expression of recombinant proteins-protein misfolding. In E. coli and other prokaryotic systems, accumulation of overexpressed recombinant proteins in the form of misfolded, insoluble aggregates is rather common [8]. The high incidence of misfolding among the overexpressed recombinant proteins may reflect the inherent upper limit of the host chaperone capacity. Efforts have been made to overexpress single and multiple combinations of chaperones native to the host, which often resulted in meaningful improvements in the net solubility of recombinant proteins [67,68]. Likewise, the co-overexpression of heat-shock chaperones and ClpB chaperone that serve to refold the insoluble aggregates also enhanced the solubility of numbers of recombinant proteins (Table 1) [50,68]. In addition, it was shown that the protein solubility can further be augmented by allowing a prolonged incubation time for in vivo protein-chaperone interaction, which increased the solubility of an array of heterologous proteins for up to 42-folds [50]. \n\nOn the other hand, reducing conditions in the prokaryotic cytoplasm may inflict biochemical perturbations on nascent polypeptides, interfering with proper disulfide bond formation and rendering the afflicted proteins insoluble [8,69].",

            "text": "Since early recombinant DNA times, bacteria (especially E. coli) have been the most widely used microorganisms for recombinant protein production due to genetic simplicity, fast growth rate, high cell density production and availability of a spectrum of genetic systems, among others. For production processes being efficient, foreign genes are expressed from plasmids and under the control of inducible promoters, what results into non physiological and unusually high transcription rates. Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109,110]. The specificity in protein aggregation makes inclusion bodies highly pure in composition and therefore enriched in the recombinant protein itself. However, also truncated versions of the recombinant product, other plasmid-encoded proteins, but also defined host cell proteins can get entrapped within bacterial inclusion bodies [111][112][113][114][115][116]. Moreover, the presence of folding assistant proteins in inclusion bodies [117-119] confirm that specific interactions lead to entrappment of cellular proteins in these aggregates. The high purity of inclusion bodies makes them a convenient source of easily extractable protein that must be refolded in vitro by denaturing procedures, a fact that has been largely exploited for biotechnology purposes",

            "text": "There are several reports in literature citing the effect of chaperones on recombinant protein expression, solubilization and folding in E. coli based expression systems. Although there have been many experimental investigations on the effects of chaperone co-expression on aggregating recombinant proteins (Caspers et al. 1994;Mogk et al. 1999;Nishihara et al. 2000), there are very few such studies on soluble recombinant proteins (Kohda et al. 2002). Our experimental investigations, involving coexpression of major chaperone teams, found that the role played by the molecular chaperones was different for a soluble recombinant protein as compared to the literature reports on aggregation-prone recombinant proteins (which often form inclusion bodies). Kohda et al. (2002) observed that coexpression of DnaK chaperone team lead to a significantly reduced level of the active recombinant protein (glutamate racemase) and attributed this to the accumulation of partially folded intermediates due to the absence of large quantities of GroEL chaperone team. However, in the present case, the DnaK chaperone team seems to impair productivity of streptokinase even in the presence of GroEL chaperone team and this indicates that the unavailability of GroEL chaperone team suggested by Kohda et al. could not be the reason for the reduced productivity. Enhancement in the biological activity of recombinant proteins during the co-expression of folding accessories has been extensively reported (Georgiou and Valax 1996). The enhancement in the activity of the recombinant protein is generally brought about by increasing the solubility of the recombinant protein (Caspers et al. 1994;Baneyx and Palumbo 2003). However, the enhancement in the activity of highly soluble recombinant protein often results from better folding of the recombinant protein.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the absence of DnaK and GroEL in E. coli mutants significantly reduces bacterial growth [161]. Absence of DnaK results in larger IB, whereas a deficiency of GroEL reduces aggregation and favors soluble protein formation, with the concomitant production of smaller and numerous IB [155]. This has been explained as a combined consequence of a less efficient folding and impaired rescue (removal) of aggregates [161]. \n\nInterestingly, expression systems that are not based on heat induction have exploited phenomena present in the heat inducible expression system to improve various aspects of recombinant protein production. For instance, chaperones like DnaK/J or DnaK/J-GrpE/ClpB have been co-expressed to facilitate disaggregation and refolding of the recombinant protein of interest [162,163]. Likewise, the co-expression of GroEL/S with heterologous proteins such as zeta-crystallin [164] and carbamoylase [165] has significantly enhanced the yield of soluble proteins. Other examples include the co-expression of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones to increase the solubility of endostatin and human ORP150, or the overexpression of DnaJ to increase soluble transglutaminase content [166,167]. Overexpression of all such chaperons naturally occurs during thermoinduction of heterologous protein. Accordingly, the knowledge gained on the molecular and physiological events that occur during recombinant protein production by the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system can be of great value to control and improve not only this expression system but others as well.",

Our in vivo analysis revealed that the mutant MalE31 polypeptide chain forms inclusion bodies after translocation and signal peptide processing. We further report the in vitro analysis of the stability and aggregation of this mutant protein compared with the wild-type protein. These data confirmed that the observed phenotype of cells expressing malE31 can be explained by a defective folding pathway of the protein.",

            "text": "P roduction of papain in prokaryotic cell lines frequently leads to protein aggregation (1,2). This is a significant challenge in achieving high yields of soluble and functional papain (3). Papain consists of a single polypeptide chain with three disulfide bridges and a sulfhydryl group crucial for its enzymatic activity (4). The formation of native disulfide bonds is not trivial and has evolved in the three cellular compartments in which catalyzed disulfide bond formation commonly occurs, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes (5), the intermembrane space of mitochondria (6), and the periplasm of prokaryotes (7). These pathways involve components that catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds. Presumably, the presence of oxygen or small molecules, such as oxidized glutathione, is necessary in vivo for disulfide bond formation (8)(9)(10). This presumption appeared to explain the fact that proteins with structural disulfide bonds are only found in the more oxidizing noncytosolic intracellular compartments or in the extracellular space (10,11). Thus, the expression of soluble papain in the cytoplasm of the Escherichia coli system is much more challenging due to the lack of an oxidizing compartment. Although inclusion bodies can be produced in high yields (2), their use is problematic as elaborate in vitro solubilization, refolding complexities, and purification procedures are required to recover biologically active protein (12,13). Furthermore, refolding conditions need to be optimized for each protein, and, in many cases, only 15%-25% of inclusion bodies will be converted to bioactive products with loss of activity and yield (14)(15)(16). To avoid the complex and time-consuming in vitro protein refolding steps required, an alternative strategy for the development of an E. coli strain that produces soluble papain is needed. \n\nThe multiple factors affect the expression of foreign disulfide bond-containing proteins in E. coli.",

            "text": "In addition to the peculiarity of providing a natural oxidizing environment that promotes the formation of disulfide bonds, the secretion of recombinant proteins in the periplasmic space offers other potential advantages. For example, the translocation reduces the exposure of the recombinant protein to host cytoplasmic proteases, reducing the degradation. Additionally, recombinant proteins are produced with a true N-terminus, thus without an N-terminal methionine. For proteins expressed in the periplasm the downstream processing is also simplified because it contains only around 4% to 8% of the natural E. coli cellular proteins and the outer membrane can be stripped away applying an osmotic shock or mild heat treatments. In spite of the above-mentioned benefits, the production of recombinant proteins into the E. coli periplasmic compartment is limited by the periplasm size and by the secretion capacity of the cell. \n\nThe periplasmic compartment accounts for less than 20% of the total cell volume. Depending on the strain, on the signal peptide used for secretion and on the protein of interest, there is a threshold of the protein amount that can be exported into the periplasmic compartment. Above a certain optimal rate of translation, secretion rates can rapidly decrease. Indeed, when the expression is too high, the translocation is slowed down by poorly exported proteins or by defective signal peptides, thereby metastable precursors may accumulate in the cytoplasm promoting inclusion bodies formation that affects protein yields and cell viability [141,142]. This excess of precursors of secretory proteins in the cytoplasm induces the up-regulation of heat shock proteins, which is mediated by the sigma factor 32 (\u03c332) [141], promoting inclusion bodies formation, reducing protein yields and cell viability (increased cell toxicity). Furthermore, it is not surprising that an excessive E. coli stress response could generate increased demand for protein folding and induce an uncharacterized metabolic burden on the cells that leads to protein misfolding and aggregation also in the periplasm.",

            "text": "the form of inclusion bodies. At this time, the expression strategy of E. coli was to extract inclusion body first and then refold the denatured proteins rather than secretory protein expression, and the difference in hNGF yield was dependent on the formation of inclusion bodies. They obtained 85 mg and 10-12 mg of recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) per liter of bacterial suspension before purification, respectively. However, 87% of the hNGF protein was lost during the purification process, which may indicate that the folding of hNGF folding is not entirely correct [30]. In 2001, Anke et al. [28] continued the method of extracting proteins from inclusion body, but changed the host strain to DE3, which is more commonly used by later researchers. The important role of pro-sequence in facilitating the folding of NGF in inclusion body is also demonstrated. Anke et al. verified that pro-sequence mediates protein entry into the endoplasmic reticulum and significantly increases the yield and rate of disulfide bond formation. Although protein production through inclusion body can ensure high protein yield, it is difficult to extract and purify protein in the later stage, involving disulfide bond formation and protein refolding [30,31]. The inclusion bodies located in the cytoplasm are particularly susceptible to degradation. An improved strategy was to produce NGF in the periplasmic space, where the protease content of protease is lower and disulfide bond forming enzymes can catalyze correct disulfide bond formation [32,33]. Different signal peptides are used for subcellular localization and increase in expression of recombinant proteins. Kilmon tried different N-terminal sequence of trp L and \u03b2-lactamase signal peptide, and it was found that the former achieves better expression of NGF [31]. Tilko used DsbA signal sequence, which is a disulfide bond forming enzyme, to express recombinant NGF [34], leading to soluble periplasmic expression of DsbA-NGF in E. coli, but yields using this approach are less than expression in cytoplasm [35].",

Production of recombinant proteins containing disulfide bond for therapeutic, diagnostic and various other purposes is a challenging task of research. Production of such proteins in the reducing cytosolic compartment of E. coli usually ends up in inclusion bodies formation. Refolding of inclusion bodies can be difficult, time and labor consuming and uneconomical. Translocation of these proteins into the oxidative periplasmic compartment provides correct environment to undergo proper disulfide bonds formation and thus achieving native conformation. However, not all proteins can be efficiently translocated to the periplasm with the help of bacterial signal peptides. Therefore, fusion to a small well-folded and stable periplasmic protein is more promising for periplasmic production of disulfide bonded proteins. In the past decades, several full-length proteins or domains were used for enhancing translocation and solubility. Here, protein fusion tags that significantly increase the yields of target proteins in the periplasmic space are reviewed.",

            "text": "Other experimental approaches were attempted in order to optimize our strategy. For example, the expression of the fusion protein rMnP1-intein-CBD, under the control of T7 promoter, caused the formation of inclusion bodies, a drawback we tried to overcome by lowering expression levels with no remarkable results [33]. The incorporation of physical disruption methods, such as sonication and vortex, was insufficient to disaggregate inclusion bodies; consequently, the solubilisation of inclusion bodies was achieved with 4 M urea (Figure 5). Another point to consider is the proper refolding of MnP after recovering from inclusion bodies [16,17,28,35]. Currently there is no single method of refolding that fits for all proteins. The refolding of recombinant protein from bacterial inclusion bodies is still a challenge for the correct expression of proteins from any source. In this work, we did not include any additional steps for the in vitro refolding of rMnP1. It is likely that both the constitutive expression of DsbC by the E. coli host and the presence of DDT during the self-cleavage step promote the refolding of MnP1, since the purified enzyme was active. Hence, our strategy can be refined if combined with other improvements. For example, the production of a recombinant MnP in E. coli was favoured by the presence of calcium and hemin during in vitro refolding, generating an active enzyme with similar properties to those of the native MnP [17,28]. Furthermore, a recent work presented a strategy where the co-expression of a combination of chaperones, alongside the expression of DsbC, allowed production of a soluble form of recombinant MnP in E. coli. However, the recombinant MnP produced still had to be subject to in vitro maturation using hemin, ATP, and an ATP regeneration system in order to help chaperones to finish their folding cycle [35]. Another strategy that could be addressed is by simultaneously decreasing the temperature of expression (16 \u2022 C) and supplementing the culture medium with four chemical additives (Triton X-100, Tween-80, glycerol, and ethanol).",

The major disadvantage of using E. coli host is the production of bodies [77]. \n\nInclusion bodies are insoluble protein aggregates that lack biological function [78]; their formation often occurs when eukaryotic proteins are overexpressed in a heterologous host such as E. coli [79]. Inclusion bodies have been considered a significant obstacle to producing soluble and active recombinant proteins [80,81]. In Table 1, most of the cold-active lipase and esterase were overexpressed in soluble forms, and only five (5) were produced as insoluble or soluble but in inactive forms. It is difficult to explain why most articles we examined in this review reported more soluble expression than insoluble inclusion bodies. Furthermore, there has been a great success not only in using biochemical and molecular techniques to prevent their formation or to address various challenges during their isolation, solubilisation, refolding, and purification [80], but their biological activity is also emerging [82,83] contrary to the previous notion that they lack activity [78].

(1988) Biotechnol. Prog. 4,[97][98][99][100][101]. \n\nWe show here that this phenomenon is not related to osmotic effects, changes in @lactamase translation or precursor processing. \n\nIt follows that the addition of sugars exerts a direct effect on the in vivo pathway of aggregation and folding, in analogy with the well characterized effect of sugars in vitro. \n\nUnder certain conditions, newly synthesized proteins do not fold properly in uiuo and are sequestered in amorphous protein aggregates. Protein aggregation is observed in cells grown at elevated temperatures (l), during the synthesis of abnormal polypeptides (2) and in cells expressing cloned gene products (3-6). Both heterologous and homologous polypeptides can form intracellular protein aggregates which are called inclusion bodies. Aggregates resulting from the expression of recombinant proteins have been observed in a wide range of microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Erwinia carotauora, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7). Despite the widespread occurrence and biotechnological significance of inclusion bodies, the mechanism responsible for their formation is not well understood. Solubilization of the aggregated proteins usually requires strong denaturing con-ditions indicating that the polypeptide chains are incorrectly folded. In that respect, inclusion bodies resemble the aggregates that form in vitro during the refolding of proteins from denaturant solutions. Detailed studies have shown that in uitro protein aggregation arises from the association of partially folded intermediates and depends on protein concentration (8, 9). In agreement with these results, Haase-Pettingel and King (10) have shown that the aggregation of P22 tailspike protein in Salmonella typhimurium is caused by the association of polypeptide molecules that fail to enter the folding pathway.",

            "text": "In these instances, extracellular secretion relies on the common Sec system, encompassing both the characteristics of the PelB signal peptide and the target protein itself [49]. Moreover, the presence of the target enzyme in the supernatant may be attributed to its synthesis in the cytoplasm and subsequent export to the periplasmic space [49,51], potentially increasing osmotic pressure within the E. coli cell and leading to outer membrane rupture, releasing proteins into the supernatant [52]. Conversely, the recombinant strain carrying the OmpA signal peptide did not exhibit detectable enzyme activity in either the fermentation broth or the periplasmic fractions. SDS-PAGE analysis of protein expression in the OmpA_Psicose strain revealed a prominent protein band larger than the size of DPEase (Figure 2B,E), which was absent in the Psicose and PelB_Psicose strain protein expressions. The increased molecular weight of this protein band suggested a fusion of DPEase with the OmpA signal peptide. Insufficient cleavage of the OmpA signal peptide from Staphylococcus aureus in the E. coli expression host could explain this, as reported with certain signal peptides [53,54]. The formation of this protein fusion with OmpA could lead to misfolding of DPEase, affecting its biochemical properties and inhibiting its enzyme activity [20,55]. \n\nThe expression of DPEase in E. coli revealed the formation of inclusion bodies, especially at 37 \u2022 C cultivation. Recombinant protein expression in E. coli often leads to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates, which are known as inclusion bodies, consisting of misfolded and non-functional proteins [46,[55][56][57]. The high expression rate driven by the T7 promoter, coupled with the absence of chaperones, results in insufficient protein folding and contributes to the production of misfolded proteins [56,57]. In addition, a high protein expression rate leads to increased protein concentration in the cytoplasm or periplasm, which reduces the solubility of the protein and promotes protein aggregation [58,59].",

In this manner, rhBMP-4 was overexpressed in inclusion bodies. These were solubilized as described in the \"material and methods\" section and subjected to in vitro refolding. Initial refolding attempts based on BMP-2 renaturation protocols [12,13] resulted in aggregation of the protein and did not lead to dimer formation. Alternative additives were included in the renaturation protocol which helped to solubilize the proteins and prevent precipitation. Commonly used additives for promoting protein refolding include amino acids (e. g. L-arginine) and detergents such as CHAPS. Rapid dilution of solubilized inclusion bodies was performed into buffers containing different concentrations of L-arginine and CHAPS. Increasing the amount of L-arginine and CHAPS enhanced the refolding yield of rhBMP-4. The combination of both additives at their optimal concentrations did not result in refolding yields significantly exceeding 15% (see Fig. 1). \n\nRenaturation was performed using protein concentrations between 50 and 100 mg/ml. Higher amounts of protein resulted in protein aggregation, thereby drastically reducing the refolding yield of soluble protein.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is still one of the most commonly convenient production systems because of low cost, effi ciency, suitability for large-scale cultivation and easy manipulation (1). However, over-expression of the recombinant non-bacterial proteins in E. coli (higher than 2 % of cellular protein) led to misfolding or incomplete folding processes. These structures could be accumulated as insoluble aggregates found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli as so-called inclusion bodies (1)(2)(3). Although, the expression of protein as inclusion bodies has a high yield, the procedures for separation, washing and solubilization of inclusion bodies and native form of the recombinant heterologous protein are often time-consuming and diffi cult (4,5). The recent studies showed that a large part of proteins in inclusion bodies is functional and thus can be used for multiple applications without being solubilized and refolded (6). However, several strategies are available to minimize the formation of inclusion bodies such as manipulation of growth temperature, medium composition, dose of inducer, induction time, and plasmid-related properties including promoter, copy number and host strain. For some pro-teins, these strategies were ineffective to get a soluble product (7,8). As known, the green fl uorescent protein (GFP) could be used to generate fl uorescent fusion proteins. Most GFP fusion proteins were constructed by placing GFP at either N-or C-terminus of the host protein. These structures could damage the function of some host proteins. Another approach was tested to insert GFP into the middle of the host protein. However, fi nding a suitable site for insertion of GFP was problematic and time-consuming (9). Thus, the production of some GFP fusion proteins was often performed in eukaryotic expression systems such as insect or yeast (10,11). In this study, we attempted to generate a biologically active fl uorescent fusion protein in an E. coli system.",

            "text": "The gram-negative bacterium E. coli is widely used as host for the production of recombinant proteins, due to wellknown genetics, simple handling and inexpensive fast high-density cultivations [1,2]. Recombinant expressed proteins in E. coli can be directed to the cytoplasm, inner or outer membrane, periplasm or the growth medium.\n\nCytoplasmatic expression is desired because of high yields of soluble product [3], but recombinant protein may accumulate in inclusion bodies (IB). Although biologic activity must be restored by in vitro renaturation procedures [4], IB can be valuable for heterologous gene expression [5]. One strategy to prevent IB formation involves fusion of the gene of interest downstream of the small eukaryotic protein ubiquitin [6]. The ubiquitin moiety enhances fusion protein yield and increases solubility due to intrinsic chaperonin properties [7]. This fusion system also allows production of proteins and peptides with an authentic N-terminus by the use of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB), cleaving the amide bond at the C-terminus of ubiquitin [8]. As E. coli lacks the ubiquitin system, release of target products can be conducted by protease addition [9,10].\n\nProtein export out of the cytoplasm has several advantages compared to intracellular production, due to 1) better folding (especially if disulfide-bond formation is required), 2) simplified downstream processing, 3) higher stability, 4) and correct N-terminal processing [11,12]. Translocation of target proteins across the inner membrane requires a signal peptide. However, presence of a signal sequence alone does not ensure secretion into the periplasmic space [13,14]. Thus, a larger secretion moiety can be linked to the target gene. Recently, a secretion system was described, using the periplasmic protease inhibitor ecotin [15] as fusion partner for the production of native pepsinogen and proinsulin in E. coli [16,17].\n\nIn the present work we established a new expression system, combining periplasmic secretion and the ubi",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is generally the first choice of host for the production of proteins and chemicals, because of its fast growth rate, a well-established expression system, high production yield, and low manufacturing cost. In E. coli cytoplasm, however, recombinant proteins tend to interact with non-specific hydrophobic patches, leading to the formation of inclusion bodies (Baneyx and Mujacic, 2004). To enhance soluble expression of recombinant proteins, various strategies have been suggested: N-terminus and/or C-terminus truncation, co-expression of chaperones, and fusion protein technologies (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005). To date, Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST), E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), E. coli N-utilization substance A (NusA), and E. coli thioredoxin are commonly used as fusion partners to prevent inclusion body formation (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006). Although fusion partners provide a general protective effect against insoluble aggregation, some soluble fusions lack detectable activities (Sachdev and Chirgwin, 1999). These soluble aggregates are formed by agglomeration of misfolded proteins of interest, while precipitation is prevented by the presence of the soluble fusion partners (Nomine et al., 2001). Thus, an alternative fusion system should be developed to increase soluble expression levels and simultaneously block agglomeration formation between misfolded target proteins. \n\nAs model proteins, we chose two fucosyltransferases (FTs). FTs transfer the fucosyl residue of GDP-L-fucose to lactose, leading to the formation of fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Microbial production of HMOs has received great attention, as they show beneficial effects on human health, such as prevention of pathogenic infection, modulation of the immune system, and prebiotic effects (Bode, 2015).",

            "text": "In this work, we employed a design of experimental methodology to optimize the production of recombinant anti-MICA scFv, MICA and IL-23p19 in E. coli. As expected, we found important yield differences at different environmental variables, with distinctive optimal conditions for each protein. In addition, for each protein studied, environmental variables had different effects on the generated models, reflecting some intrinsic protein properties that can affect protein biosynthesis and/or folding. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that insoluble proteins were markedly different at the preferred environmental conditions and amino acid content from a set of soluble proteins described in the literature. Finally, we showed that a simple refolding experiment can be successfully applied to obtain the best conditions for full-scale protein refolding. \n\nObtaining high yields of soluble protein can be challenging, as the majority of proteins tend to aggregate as inclusion bodies 25 . This can delay a successful expression experiment, given the rather complex steps needed to obtain native protein in this scenario. However, inclusion bodies have several advantages, such as high levels of protein expression and purity. Optimizing the expression of recombinant proteins in this compartment, as we show in the present work, is relatively uncommon, although it can be a very promising strategy. The three-level Box-Behnken design is relatively easy to run with standard laboratory equipment. After a three-day experiment, including protein expression, inclusion bodies purification and solubilization, purification and refolding, a researcher can have complete working space and obtain important insights to develop a more robust and productive expression system. The yields obtained for each protein varied significantly, as expected; however, more importantly, they varied between each run. These differences should be interpreted as room for improvement, and to the fact that obtaining protein in inclusion bodies can be fine-tuned by different environmental variables. \n\nAlthough there are other factors that can be optimized, including OD at induction, pre-induction time, the use of different plasmid constructions, the use of different hosts and codon optimization, we favored the speed of our analysis using factors widely reported in the literature 22,[26][27][28][29] .",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production via prokaryotic system has brought hundreds of therapeutic proteins into clinical applications or clinical trials over the past few decades (Dimitrov, 2012;S\u00e1nchez-Trasvi\u00f1a et al., 2021). Recombinant proteins are frequently soluble. In some cases, when high-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli occurs, insoluble aggregates accumulate as inclusion bodies. Numerous strategies were attempted to overcome this problem, such as the optimization of bacterial strains, promoters, inducers, as well as the use of N-terminal signal peptides (SPs), which could help recombinant proteins be secreted into the culture medium (Tegel et al., 2011;Chen, 2012;Freudl, 2018;Owji et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2019). Compared to intracellular expression, extracellular production of proteins possesses several advantages. First, extracellular expression could prevent aggregations of proteins and accumulation of inclusion bodies. Second, protein secretion from cytoplasm to periplasm provides an oxidative environment, which facilitates correct protein folding and disulfide bond formation (Ruiz et al., 2006;Mergulh\u00e3o and Monteiro, 2007;Silhavy et al., 2010;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Kleiner-Grote et al., 2018;Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2021), which is essential for their biological activities. Moreover, secretion of proteins into growth medium requires no cell disruption as well as downstream purification steps, reducing the complexity of bioprocess and significantly improving product purity since there is no intracellular protein contamination (Kleiner-Grote et al., 2018;Green et al., 2019;Yao et al., 2019;Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2021). Therefore, a variety of strategies have been taken to accomplish extracellular expression (Ni and Chen, 2009). \n\nProteins are generally exported via the general secretory (Sec) pathway (Costa et al., 2015;Burdette et al., 2018), which commonly exists in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Cao and Saier, 2003).",

            "text": "Bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) are submicron proteinaceous particles (usually ranging from 50 to about 800 nm (Figure 1 A, B) observed in recombinant bacteria. IB formation has been regularly reported during the forced expression of cloned genes as an intrinsic, often unavoidable idiosyncrasy of the recombinant 'bacterial factory'. Under transmission electron microscopy IBs are visualized as electrodense (Figure 1 A, bottom), dark areas in the cytoplasm (or sporadically in the periplasm, for secretory proteins), as the result of the aggregation and deposition as insoluble clusters of significant fractions of recombinant protein. \n\nIn this context, IBs are considered as a major drawback for high yield production of soluble proteins, either for research or as marketable goods in the biotechnological or pharmaceutical industry [1]. In an attempt to minimize IB formation and thus shift production towards soluble protein versions, many strategies have been proposed, including genetic approaches (e.g., reduction of gene dosage or gene expression rates), physical methods (e.g., lowering the culture temperature), physiological methodologies (e.g., co-producing chaperones and folding modulators) and nutrient availability (e.g., carbon source limitation) [2,3]. The success in the application of these procedures is not predictable, since being variable and product-linked they have not led into a universally established protocol applicable to all IB-forming proteins. On the other hand, IBs are mechanically stable protein deposits. They can be easily isolated upon cell disruption by simple physical means and used as a relatively pure source of recombinant protein which can be transformed into the active soluble form by solubilisation and subsequent refolding. For example, the first recombinant protein approved by the FDA for human application was insulin, the two chains produced in separate E. coli strains as fusion proteins forming IBs. Still today, human insulin is produced using two major routes. One route involves the production of a precursor in form of IBs using E. coli as production host with subsequent solubilization and refolding [4].",

            "text": "Currently it is often difficult to produce disulfide bond containing proteins, especially on a large scale. This severely inhibits scientific progress in understanding a myriad of mechanistic processes and imposes limitations on the biotechnology industry for the production of therapeutic proteins. The most common route for large scale production of proteins that contain disulfide bonds involves biosynthesis in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Here there are no mechanisms for disulfide bond formation. Due to this recombinant proteins are unable to attain their native conformation and form insoluble inclusion bodies. Inclusion body refolding is a widely studied field. However, it can be costly, complex, time consuming and is often inefficient. Alternative routes for producing disulfide bonded proteins such as periplasmic expression or expression in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes also have drawbacks.\n\nCurrent systems for making disulfide bonded proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli are based on the disruption of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase and glutathione/glutathione reductase pathways present in this cytoplasm [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. We recently showed that by coexpression of a catalyst of disulfide bond formation prokaryotic disulfide bond containing proteins could be produced even without disruption of these reducing pathways [12]. Here we further develop and test this system for the production of eukaryotic proteins with multiple disulfide bonds.\n\nFor proteins with only a few disulfide bonds e.g. PhoA and AppA, we showed that the addition of a catalytic system for the formation of disulfide bonds i.e. coexpression of the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1p, increased the yields of active protein produced up to 1000-fold over the wild-type E. coli control, with yields of up to 16 mg/L of culture [12]. Furthermore, the addition of a catalyst for the formation of disulfide bonds is more effective than the removal of the reducing pathways for these proteins i.e. BL21 (DE3) pLysSR",

It is difficult to decide which combination of host organism-promoter system would be the best for specific recombinant protein production; therefore this still has to be optimized for each product individually. \n\nSince Escherichia coli have all the above described advantages [1] and the laboratory strains are regarded as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organisms, it is still one of the most commonly used bacterial host system, not only on laboratory scale use, but also for production of therapeutic proteins [2][3][4][5]. \n\nHowever, during recombinant protein production in E. coli, proteins often tend to aggregate into protein particles called inclusion bodies (IBs). Until recently, IBs were considered as deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins and represented bottleneck in recombinant protein production. Therefore many pharmaceutically interesting proteins have been disregarded for commercialization [6]. Nevertheless, the latest studies on protein aggregation have shown that protein aggregation into IBs does not necessarily imply protein inactivation [7][8][9][10] thus studies on protein aggregation has become an important subject in many fields, including biology, medicine and biotechnology [11]. This article gives an overview on the latest trends in recombinant protein production in E. coli, their aggregation and the possible applications of such protein particles (IBs).",

            "text": "The difficult process and high cost of extraction and separation of natural enterokinase and its probable contamination by other protease led to a great attempt to produce it on larger scale and lower finished cost in E. coli. A lot of research has been done to produce this enzyme in E. coli (Skala 2013;Chun et al. 2011) and Pichia pastoris (Smith 2013) in the form of IB (inclusion bodies) or soluble protein. Production of active enzymes in most of them was limited and needed several steps of purification or dialysis. \n\nThioredoxin (TRX) as a chaperon-like fusion tag helps the solubility and stability of the fusion protein (Berndt 2008). It can be followed by DDDDK enterokinase and cleaved from the target protein using enterokinase activity. \n\nDifferent strains of E. coli have been developed for different purposes. Among them, Bl21 (DE3) with Escherichia coli T7 RNA polymerase-based protein production in combination with T7 promoter-based expression vector allows high-efficiency protein expression of any gene that is under the control of a T7 promoter. The lon protease deficiency and the lack of ompT, outer membrane protease, which can degrade recombinant proteins during purification serve as advantages of BL21 (Grodberg and Dunn 1988). NiCo21 (DE3) and SHuffle T7 strains have been also engineered to minimize E. coli protein contamination and recombinant protein folding containing multiple disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm, respectively (Robichon et al. 2011;Lobstein et al. 2012;Kim et al. 2021). \n\nOne of the complexities of enterokinase production is related to the multiple disulfide bonds and an unpaired thiol that directs the protein production process to the IB formation (Schumann and Ferreira 2004). One strategy to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies is to slow down the production of recombinant proteins at low temperatures because the ability of the protein to fold at temperatures above 30 \u00b0C is decreased. Sometimes, it is probably the easiest and the most useful method which can prevent inclusion body formation by facilitating correct folding.",

The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction). Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction, cell lysis conditions etc. which play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form in vivo have been optimized. We have studied the effect of assistance of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we",

            "text": "BackgroundThe effects and effectiveness of the chaperone pair GroELS on the yield and quality of recombinant polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli are matter of controversy, as the reported activities of this complex are not always consistent and eventually indicate undesired side effects. The divergence in the reported data could be due, at least partially, to different experimental conditions in independent research approaches.ResultsWe have then selected two structurally different model proteins (namely GFP and E. coli \u03b2-galactosidase) and two derived aggregation-prone fusions to explore, in a systematic way, the eventual effects of GroELS co-production on yield, solubility and conformational quality. Host cells were cultured at two alternative temperatures below the threshold at which thermal stress is expected to be triggered, to minimize the involvement of independent stress factors.ConclusionsFrom the analysis of protein yield, solubility and biological activity of the four model proteins produced alone or along the chaperones, we conclude that GroELS impacts on yield and quality of aggregation-prone proteins with intrinsic determinants but not on thermally induced protein aggregation. No effective modifications of protein solubility have been observed, but significant stabilization of small (encapsulable) substrates and moderate chaperone-induced degradation of larger (excluded) polypeptides. These findings indicate that the activities of this chaperone pair in the context of actively producing recombinant bacteria discriminate between intrinsic and thermally-induced protein aggregation, and that the side effects of GroELS overproduction might be determined by substrate size.",

Despite the accumulated evidence indicating that MBP is a very promising solubility-enhancing partner [39][40][41], no affinity tag is universally ideal and many have the same downside of yielding different performances with different partner proteins [43,44]. Fusing an insoluble protein to a solubility-enhancing partner does not guarantee a soluble fusion protein [39].\n\nThere are multiple factors that contribute towards the formation of protein aggregates during heterologous expression in E. coli. Under normal circumstances, one protein chain is released from the ribosome of E.coli every 35 s and the macromolecule concentration can reach 300-400 mg ml \u00c01. Under these conditions the correct folding of a protein can be considered an extraordinary event [45]. In addition, the newly synthesized recombinant protein is being synthesized in an environment that may be quite different from that of its original source in terms of pH, osmolarity, redox potential, co-factors and folding mechanisms [46]. Finally, it may also be the case that insolubility is an intrinsic property of a particular protein [41]. Either way, if a given protein fails to rapidly achieve its native conformation there are two possible consequences: partial or complete deposition into inclusion bodies [45]. Tight control of a variety of parameters, including temperature of expression, expression rate and inducer concentration, might help to reduce the formation of aggregates [37,43]. In many cases, the overexpression of genes in E.coli remains an unsolved  problem as the proteins continue to be synthesized as inclusion bodies.\n\nConsidering the impossibility of produci both fusion proteins in a soluble form, even with the MBP in the construction as a solubility-enhancing tag, the next step was to solubilize and re-fold the inclusion bodies, as described in Methods. The solubilized peptide-fusion proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4) and the results obtained revealed that, despite both His 6 MBPBladSP-10 and His 6 MBPBladSub5 being synthesized as inclusion bodies and thus only soluble in denaturant buffer",

            "text": "Bacteria have long served as cell factories for recombinant protein production, while higher yields of soluble proteins have always been pursued. However, overexpression of heterogenous proteins often leads to the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates, commonly known as inclusion bodies (IBs). The accumulation of IBs has been one main obstacle of recombinant protein production, as they are often clusters of misfolded polypeptides, which are thus disfunctional and undesirable [1]. However, over the last several years, it is gradually realized that some IBs could be still biologically active, without regard to their insolubility [2][3][4]. Partially active IBs were first observed for \u03b2-galactosidase in 1989 [5], likely as a result of a small amount of correctly folded protein entrapped in inactive unfolded polypeptide molecules [6]. True active IBs, in which the majority of the polypeptides remain active, were first reported in early 1991 [7], and have gained more attention since 2005 [8]. In particular, when used as fusion protein partners, the foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid protein VP1, the human \u03b2-amyloid peptide A\u03b242(F19D) [8], a maltose-binding protein mutant (MalE31) [9], and the cellulose-binding domain of Clostridium cellulovorans (CBD clos ) [10][11][12][13][14] have been shown to induce the formation of active inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli (E. coli) with specific activities ranging from about 20% to levels comparable with the native proteins [8,10]. These new findings have enhanced the understanding of protein folding, and also led to several studies about using these active inclusion bodies for immobilized biocatalysis [15], bioassays [13], and biomaterials [16].",

            "text": "Recombinant DNA-mediated polypeptide production remains a popular approach for obtaining properly folded disulfide-containing protein and peptides. Many reviews are available that address the effect of various parameters such as different host organisms [78,79], expression vectors [80], expression rate [81,82], and purification [83,84]. With respect to host systems, many cell lines are available for expressing recombinant peptides and proteins such as E. coli [85], Chinese hamster ovary cells [86], human embryonic kidney cells [87], and S. cerevisiae [88]. The wide range of molecular biology options with E. coli systems provides many options to ensure proper disulfide bond generation [89,90]. E. coli expression is fast and inexpensive to scale-up but not all proteins are amenable to expression in this system [91,92]. \n\nA major challenge in obtaining a recombinant protein is correct folding. A protein synthesized in a recombinant cell is often produced in reduced form, which is then oxidized (refolded) using suitable folding conditions [93,94]. The target crude peptide/protein can be obtained in reduced form and then refolded with the aid of various enzymes as disulfide catalyst systems [95,96]. Alternatively, oxidative folding is possible without the use of any enzyme [97,98]. However, such refolding can be a problematic step. Misfolding is a major issue with cysteine-containing polypeptides resulting in low yields. This limitation has necessitated the development of new methodologies to enable the acquisition of correctly folded protein or peptide in its native form in high yields. To assist the refolding, various tactics have been employed including inclusion body formation [99,100], co-expression of supporting enzymes [101,102] and chemical assistance [100].",

After incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 30 min, twenty microlitres supernatant was directly analyzed by HPLC. As illustrated in Figure S3, there are no specific peaks corresponding reaction products in the three reaction mixtures, suggesting no activities toward UDP-GlcA occurred in these OcUGlcAE proteins (Figure S3). The unavailability of active recombinant enzymes was present when trun-OcUGlcAEs were expressed in E. coli, presumably due to the N-terminal truncation that resulted in improper folding and decreased stability of these recombinant proteins. Three full-length OcUGlcAE proteins were therefore heterologously expressed in P. pastoris for active recombinant enzymes.",

They play important roles in a variety of cell processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle, and their failure is consequently correlated with several diseases.\n\nWith the introduction of the DNA recombinant technology in the 1970s, proteins started to be expressed in several host organisms resulting in a faster and easier process compared to their natural sources (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Escherichia coli remains the dominant host for producing recombinant proteins, owing to its advantageous fast and inexpensive, and high yield protein production, together with the well-characterized genetics and variety of available molecular tools (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).\n\nThe recombinant protein production in E. coli has greatly contributed for several structural studies; for instance, about 90% of the structures available in the Protein Data Bank were determined on proteins produced in E. coli. (Nettleship et al., 2010;Bird, 2011). The E. coli recombinant production has also boosted the biopharmaceutical industry: 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed up to 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) were obtained using this host cell (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Walsh, 2010;Berlec and Strukelj, 2013).\n\nEscherichia coli recombinant protein-based products can also be found in major sectors of the enzyme industry and the agricultural industry with applications ranging from catalysis (e.g., washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g., vaccine development) to functional analysis and structure determination (e.g., crystallography; Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). As a bacterial system, the E. coli has, however, limitations at expressing more complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011).

            "text": "Recombinant protein production has become a routine practice in many laboratories from academic to industrial fields. Several hosts are available for protein production among them, Escherichia coli has been by far the most widely used. Some advantages of this host is the low cost, infrastructure of implementation, easy handling, high yield production, and an ever increasing set of tools and genetic information useful for the expression of challenging targets. Despite its importance and utility, recombinant proteins (RP) not always are produced in a soluble and homogeneous state. For these \"difficult to express\" proteins, several approaches have been developed in order to overcome the problems associated with insolubility. Some parameters that can affect protein expression are: induction temperature, promoter strength, use of specific E. coli strains, co-expression of molecular chaperones or biological partners and the use of different solubility enhancer or fusion proteins (Correa and Oppezzo, 2011). In the last decade, the advent of high-throughput screening methods have facilitated the evaluation of hundreds of conditions generated from the combination of the mentioned parameters in order to find one that gives a soluble protein (Vincentelli et al., 2011;Vincentelli and Romier, 2013). However, to exploit all these variables it is necessary to have a method for cloning the target gene in many different vectors in a fast and simple manner. Several techniques were recently generated to facilitate the cloning of target genes in a parallel way, in which the same insert can be introduced into different expression vectors simultaneously. Among these methods are the Gateway technology [Invitrogen, (Esposito et al., 2009)], In-Fusion technology, [Clontech, (Berrow et al., 2007)], Ligase Independent Cloning, (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990), and Restriction Free Cloning, [RF cloning, (Unger et al., 2010)].",

            "text": "E. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

            "text": "From a different perspective, it is notable that the lower levels of proteases in the periplasm boosts protein stability by avoiding unwanted degradation [13]. Furthermore, cleavage by the signal peptidase (for instance the Lep protease) of the N-terminal signal sequence leads to an authentic N-terminus by rendering the target protein devoid of the initial Methionine, restriction enzyme scar sites and other unwanted junk sequences that may adversely affect the native protein structure and function [35]. \n\nA variety of measures were taken to mitigate the shortcomings of cytoplasmic recombinant PF4 production to achieve enhanced solubility, higher yields, robust folding, efficient oligomerization, and increased purity, through the cumbersome manipulation of intracellular expression systems and successive steps of technically demanding protein purification strategies. In an effort to produce a recombinant form of PF4 with antigenic similarity to its native variant, several chemicals were employed to enhance protein solubility and yield [36]. In another study, an effort was made to augment the PF4 protein expression by placing its encoding sequence in several tandem repeats [37]. Although these methods seemed to remedy some of the shortcomings, producing the recombinant form of PF4 lacking its native disulfide bonds appears to be suboptimal. Furthermore, handling the large volume of cell culture or introducing tandem repeats of PF4 genes into the construct in order to increase the protein yield mainly gave rise to inclusion body formation. However, extracellular recombinant PF4 production was found to more effectively alleviate many of the aforementioned downsides compared to intracellular protein expression. Ultra-large complex formation between unfractionated heparin and secreted rPF4 revealed a high protein solubility, proper folding, and efficient formation of tetramers, as confirmed by dynamic light scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and Western blotting.The secretion of the recombinant PF4 to the extracellular medium also circumvents the arduous task of removing LPS as it preserves the bacterial cell integrity by avoiding the need for bacterial cell wall rupture.",

            "text": "The overproduction of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli leads to insoluble aggregates of proteins called inclusion bodies (IBs). IBs are considered dynamic entities that harbor high percentages of the recombinant protein, which can be found in different conformational states. The production conditions influence the properties of IBs and recombinant protein recovery and solubilization. The E. coli growth in thermoinduced systems is generally carried out at 30 \u00b0C and then recombinant protein production at 42 \u00b0C. Since the heat shock response in E. coli is triggered above 34 \u00b0C, the synthesis of heat shock proteins can modify the yields of the recombinant protein and the structural quality of IBs. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different pre-induction temperatures (30 and 34 \u00b0C) on the growth of E. coli W3110 producing the human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) and on the IBs structure in a \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 thermoinducible system. The recombinant E. coli cultures growing at 34 \u00b0C showed a\u2009~\u200969% increase in the specific growth rate compared to cultures grown at 30 \u00b0C. The amount of rHuGM-CSF in IBs was significantly higher in cultures grown at 34 \u00b0C. Main folding chaperones (DnaK and GroEL) were associated with IBs and their co-chaperones (DnaJ and GroES) with the soluble protein fraction. Finally, IBs from cultures that grew at 34 \u00b0C had a lower content of amyloid-like structure and were more sensitive to proteolytic degradation than IBs obtained from cultures at 30 \u00b0C. Our study presents evidence that increasing the pre-induction temperature in a thermoinduced system allows obtaining higher recombinant protein and reducing amyloid contents of the IBs. \u2022 Pre-induction temperature determines inclusion bodies architecture \u2022 In pre-induction (above 34 \u00b0C), the heat shock response increases recombinant protein production \u2022 Inclusion bodies at higher pre-induction temperature show a lower amyloid content",

            "text": "Bacterial inclusion bodies are commonly known as insoluble protein aggregates, originally developed during recombinant proteosynthesis. In Escherichia coli cells, they are observed since the beginning of recombinant technologies (Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2012). As they have been seen as a major obstacle in the production of soluble proteins, many protein-specific molecular and biochemical strategies have been employed to avoid their formation. Nonetheless, yet around 80 % of overexpressed recombinant proteins are packed into IBs (J\u00fcrgen et al., 2010). Consequently, when protein itself cannot be expressed in a high amount in soluble form, IBs are considered the main source of recombinant protein. However, timeconsuming and expensive refolding strategies are required to obtain an active and properly folded form. Over the years, understanding the relation between their origin, function, and properties opened new possibilities for direct IBs applications in a wide range of areas. Furthermore, many types of research proved, that even partially or incorrectly folded proteins within IBs are capable of maintaining their functional or catalytic activity. Thus, IBs, previously viewed as undesirable waste have become a subject of interest in fields of medicine, biotechnology, pharmacy, material science, and more.",

Molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appear to present a panacea for problems of heterologous protein folding in the organism, due largely to their broad substrate range compared with, e.g., protein-specific mutagenesis approaches. Painstaking investigation of chaperone overproduction has, however, met with mixed \u2013 and largely unpredictable \u2013 results to date. The past 5 years have nevertheless seen an explosion in interest in exploiting the native folding modulators of E. coli, and particularly cocktails thereof, driven largely by the availability of plasmid systems that facilitate simultaneous, non-rational screening of multiple chaperones during recombinant protein expression. As interest in using E. coli to produce recombinant membrane proteins and even glycoproteins grows, approaches to reduce aggregation, delay host cell lysis and optimise expression of difficult-to-express recombinant proteins will become even more critical over the coming years. In this review, we critically evaluate the performance of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts native to E. coli in improving functional production of heterologous proteins in the bacterium and we discuss how they might best be exploited to provide increased amounts of correctly-folded, active protein for biochemical and biophysical studies.",

            "text": "The overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli can result in their aggregation into insoluble inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm [78]. This is unfavorable, as incomplete or incorrect folding can inhibit both the formation of conformational epitopes and the exposure of linear epitopes [79]. Two strategies can be employed to circumvent this issue: \n\n(1) taking steps to prevent the formation of aggregates or (2) solubilization and refolding of target proteins from inclusion bodies in vitro. \n\nOften, the challenge of achieving native protein conformations increases with the number of cysteine residues due to the various possible isoforms and complexity of disulfide bond patterns [80]. The correct folding of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in E. coli systems is limited by the reducing cytoplasmic environment maintained by several cellular components, including the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which are effective in reducing disulfide bonds back to free thiols [81]. One approach to mitigate this issue focuses on using strains engineered to promote an oxidative environment in the cytoplasm by knocking out thioredoxin reductase and glutaredoxin reductase (encoded by the genes trxB and gor, respectively) [82]. These \u2206gor \u2206trxB strains can be purchased commercially under the names Origami, Rosetta-gami (Novagen) or SHuffle (New England Biolabs). The SHuffle system additionally produces DsbC in the cytoplasm, which acts as a catalyst for disulfide bond isomerization [83]. Interestingly, Nguyen et al. [83] reported the production of eukaryotic proteins containing disulfide bonds in bacterial cells without disrupting the reducing pathways. The authors state that the co-expression of a sulfhydryl oxidase and a disulfide isomerase, catalysts of S-S bond formation, allows for the correct folding of proteins in the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Aggregation is a disappointing, but frequent and quantitative relevant, shortcoming during recombinant expression in E. coli. The reasons for which even proteins with apparently simple structure fail to fold correctly remain unknown. A constantly increasing number of expedients have been proposed to improve the solubility of single proteins. However, their successful application to any further candidate remains unpredictable. Considering such reasons, and the always easier accessibility to automation that can speed up several growth and purification steps, systematic approaches have been proposed. They are based on small scale combinations of different variables like growth conditions, lysis buffers, type of constructs, host strains, fusion tags, co-expression of molecular chaperones and addition of osmolytes to identify promising solutions to be verified in large scale purification [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].\n\nThe resulting numerous samples can be screened using protocols based on SDS-PAGE or dot-blot to discriminate between promising and negative results [8][9][10].\n\nMolecular probes capable to indicate the solubility of the target protein independently of a separation step can also be used. GFP has been fused to the C-term of the target proteins and the fluorescence of the resulting fusion protein considered indicative of its correct folding [11]. Similarly, fusions with \u03b2-galactosidase [12], chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [13] or the structural complementation between the C-term fused \u03b1-fragment of the \u03b2-galactosidase with the \u03c9-fragment [14] have been described. However, the systems relying on GFP have at least two strong limitations, namely the long lag-phase (95 min) necessary to the chromophore to form and the persistence of the fluorescence even after protein aggregation [15,16]. In this context, the strategies exploiting the measurement of enzymatic activities seem, therefore, more reliable.\n\nAll these methods involve the production of fusion constructs that can modify the intrinsic solubility of the target protein. In an alternative approach a probe is used, the expression of which depends specifically on the presence of the aggregates, whilst it does not interact directly with the target protein. Lesley",

Some other approaches include co-expression of different folding enzymes, such as peptidyl-prolyl cis/transisomerases and periplasmic dithiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. 23 Gaciarz et al also suggested a system called CyDisCo used for efficient production of disulfide bond containing proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli. 16 CyDisCo is based on coexpression of a sulfhydryl oxidase and a protein disulfide isomerase, which catalyze the formation and isomerization of the disulfide bond. The results indicated that more than 90% of the tested scFv and Fab fragments could be produced and correctly folded in the biologically active form within the cytoplasm. 16 Furthermore, the addition of certain fusion partners, such as maltose-binding protein and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), is also reported to improve stability, solubility, and the expression yield of recombinant proteins. 16",

            "text": "We systematically examined the effect of these factors on the yield of soluble recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein. Fig. 4 compares the yield of recombinant GST-QPc fusion proteins eluted from glutathione agarose gel, after incubation with soluble fractions of lysate from E. coli culture induced at 37 \u00b0C (lane 3) and 27 \u00b0C (lane 4). Induction at 27 \u00b0C improved the yield over induction at 37 \u00b0C, by 4-fold, although the total amount of recombinant GST-QPc produced by the E. coli cultures induced at these temperatures was about the same. In other words, when the cell culture was induced at 27 \u00b0C, about 40% of the GST-QPc fusion protein produced was in the soluble form, compared to 10% with the culture induced at 37 \u00b0C. This result is compatible with previous reports (32,33) of increased soluble yield of recombinant polypeptide in E. coli using low growth temperature. \n\nAlthough lowering the induction temperature increased the yield of soluble active GST-QPc fusion protein, about 60% of the recombinant fusion protein still remained in inclusion body complexes. To further increase the soluble yield, a method involving the use of osmotic stress to facilitate the uptake of the \"compatible solute\" glycyl betaine (34) was adopted. When E. coli JM109/pGEX-QPc cells were grown at 27 \u00b0C on LB medium containing 2.5 mM betaine and 440 mM sorbitol, the yield of soluble recombinant protein was twice as high as that for cells grown in the absence of these compounds (see Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). This result is similar to that reported by Blackwell and Horgan (35) in which the inclusion of betaine and sorbitol in the growth medium converts a highly expressed Agrobacterium DMAPP:AMP transferase, which normally accumulates as inclusion complexes in E. coli, into an active soluble form.",

            "text": "Recombinant production of high disulfide bond-rich proteins is challenging by the use of microbial hosts, as it results in the formation of inclusion bodies [31]. Morphologically, inclusion bodies are dense, amorphous protein deposits that can be found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic regions of bacteria [32]. The right refolding processes of inclusion body refolding processes are poised to play a major role in the production of recombinant proteins. Protein refolding is the process by which an unstructured protein alters its conformation to reach its native structure. Hence, the renaturation of these inclusion body proteins is a field of increasing interest in gaining large amounts of correctly folded proteins. \n\nImproving biologically active renatured protein yields by minimizing aggregation and cost-effectiveness involves improvement in the process of inclusion body isolation, washing, solubilization of the aggregated protein, and actual refolding. While the efficiency of the washing and solubilization steps can be relatively high, refolding protein yields may be limited by the accumulation of inactive misfolded as well as aggregated protein [33]. Because the majority of cysteine-rich proteins including antibodies contains one or more disulfide bonds, refolding with concomitant disulfide-bond formation is challenging in a bacteria host [34]. Bacterial cells containing inclusion bodies are usually disrupted by high-pressure homogenization or a combination of mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods [35]. The resulting suspension is treated by either low-speed centrifugation or filtration to remove soluble proteins from the particulate containing the inclusion bodies. To date, no information was provided about the efficiency of IBs solubilization process or the range of inclusion body protein. \n\nThe most commonly used solubilizing agents are denaturants, such as guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) and urea (6-8 M), and protein concentrations of 1-10 mg/mL during the solubilization step [36].",

However, since SCARB2 is a human-derived protein, it required complex post-translational modifications, including ten N-glycosylation  sites along with two disulfide bridges, both of which may be involved in the correct folding of the receptor 11 . Therefore, in this study, to evaluate the role of disulfide bridges in supporting correct folding, and increasing the solubility of the target protein, SCARB2 was expressed in both E. coli BL21(DE3), and E. coli SHuffle \u00ae T7 Express. Specifically, E. coli SHuffle \u00ae T7 Express was ideal for the expression of disulfide bridge-carrying recombinant proteins, with protein activity yielding several times higher than the previously popular E. coli Origami(DE3) 20 . Unexpectedly, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant SCARB2 receptor was only obtained in inclusion bodies when expressed in E. coli system. This demonstrated that disulfide bridges did not significantly contribute to the receptor's solubility. Besides, the role of disulfide bridges in the interaction with EV-A71 remained unclear, raising a question to investigate, and obtaining the soluble form of recombinant SCARB2 was required. \n\nInclusion bodies are aggregate and water-insoluble proteins, due to incorrect folding structure 21,22 . Inclusions are formed in the cytoplasm of E. coli for two main reasons: the expression systems, and the nature of the proteins. The limitation of the host system is the most common issue, including overexpressed protein leading to machinery overload and inclusion bodies formation. In addition, the E. coli system lacks some necessary post-translational modifications for protein folding, such as disulfide bridge formation and glycosylation 22 . This factor is also directly related to ensuring proper expression of target proteins, especially viral or mammalian proteins. As the inclusion body exists in the aggregation, leading to the incorrect folding and configuration of targeted proteins, also affecting its biological activity. Two refolding methods were carried out to dissolve the SCARB2 inclusions 14,16 .",

The latter reacts by employing a heat-shock like response, which involves the induction of chaperones, foldases and proteases [10]. Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many recombinant proteins form inclusion bodies (IBs) which represent insoluble protein aggregates and necessitates elaborate downstream processing including de/re-naturation methods [8]. Recent work shows that IB-trapped proteins may actually be used directly [11], a result that contradicts the traditional thinking that IBs consist of misfolded, and thus inactive, protein. Still, in both cases further processing is needed to achieve soluble protein products [12]. On the other hand, the formation of inclusion bodies can also represent a favorable factor as the formation of such insoluble protein greatly facilitates initial protein enrichment. As such, the protein of interest as well as the purpose of the recombinant product will determine the desirable approach.\n\nThe goals of RPP are high protein yield and bioactivity, two variables that can have opposing dynamics. Despite notable advances (Table 1), the need for novel strategies that facilitate predictable and robust protein production processes is clearly present [13,14]. Most of the available expression platforms depend on either constitutive expression or fine-tuning of inducer concentrations, in order to adjust factors such as protein yield and solubility. For example, molecular chaperones and foldases are usually co-expressed from accessory plasmids with no further control [15]. However, imbalanced expression of these proteins can have detrimental effects on the production process. This leads to time-consuming fine-tuning, that is not robust to process modifications (e.g. a change in temperature or medium) as the optimal circuit operating point moves away from its previous value.\n\nIn order to address challenges such as balancing protein production and cellular stress, we developed a synthetic expression platform that enables the cell to shut down the RPP mechanism by itself, once stress signals are detected. For this implementation we used and created new standardized parts and developed a computational model to elucidate the dynamics of this protein expression system. This study illustrates the potential of synthetic biology to help traditional",

Zhou and his coworkers had successfully expressed NS1 in Pichia pastoris and obtained 70 mg/L [24]. Though the amount of rNS1 produced here (155 mg/L) is lesser than what Das and his coworkers reported earlier, their experiment is time consuming and costly as they optimized codon and employed refolding conditions to attain protein in native form. \n\nAddition of agent like GSH/GSSG during refolding increases soluble protein production by maintaining oxidized environment and enhances disulfide bond formation [25,26]. Previously, researchers found that thioredoxin can accumulate up to 40% of total protein content and remains soluble when overexpressed in E. coli [27]. Thioredoxin was shown to act as a chaperone during protein folding [28,29] and found to hold the folding intermediates of the heterologously expressing protein in soluble form until the protein attains its final conformation [27]. \n\nSoluble protein production can be obtained by a variety of techniques reviewed by the authors in [9]. Usually solubility is increased by tuning down production rate, decreasing the strength of promoter activity, and increasing molecular chaperons. The araC gene of pBAD promoter acts as both positive and negative regulator [30] and can be repressed in presence of glucose [31]. In a novel approach, we added different concentrations of glucose (repressor) to the medium and analysed its impact on recombinant protein produced. Surprisingly, glucose at 0.0001% concentration at 30 \u2218 C in 0.2% arabinose increases the total quantity of protein produced from 140 mg/L to 155 mg/L (Figures 3  and 4). We hypothesize that the enhancement seems to be solely dependant on equilibrium between the repressor and inducer concentrations. Increase in inducer and/or repressor concentration does not increase the quantity of recombinant protein produced; rather it shifts equilibrium and results in the inclusion body formation.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is frequently used for the production of non-glycosylated proteins due to its well-characterized genome, cheap cultivation and fast growth (Rosano et al., 2019). However, high transcription rates of the target protein often lead to the formation of intracellular protein aggregates, known as inclusion bodies (IBs) (Lee & Hsu, 2018). IB formation can be reduced by either lowering the cultivation temperature during induction or by fusing solubility tags to the protein of interest. Still, the paradigm of IBs shifted and IB processing is applied in pharmaceutical industry up to date (Costa et al., 2014;Garc\u00eda-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2012;Rinas et al., 2017). The natural phenomenon of IB formation in E. coli has been known for decades (Fahnert et al., 2004;Rosano et al., 2019). In 2008, Lindner et al. established a model based on fluorescence microscopy data, describing the intracellular localization of native cell aggregates (Lindner et al., 2008). However, fundamental aspects of recombinant IB formation and IB characteristics remain either unknown or ambiguously discussed in literature due to the complexity of heterologous protein production and the mechanisms involved (Baneyx, 1999;Carri\u00f3 & Villaverde, 2003, 2005). Moreover, the type of expression system as well as the age of the culture have major influences on protein aggregate formation (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004). Combining these factors with a decreasing production rate for ageing cells may lead to various different IB agglomerates (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004;Lindner et al., 2008). Lee and Hsu described IB formation as a three step-reaction: partially misfolded peptide chains fuse to so-called proto-aggregates, which then merge to spherical IBs (Lee & Hsu, 2018). The existence of rod-and spherical-shaped protein aggregates has been postulated, but an explanation of distinct IB morphologies is still missing in literature (Bowden et al., 1991;Carri\u00f3 et al., 2000;Humer & Spadiut, 2018).",

            "text": "The use of recombinant proteins has increased with the advent of various expression hosts that facilitate their soluble, biologically active, and large-scale production. Although mammalian expression systems possess many advantages (Wurm 2004), the bacterial expression system is considered the most efficient host compared to other organisms for the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals because of its various attributes, including high expression yield, cost-effectiveness, rapid protein expression, and proficient scale-up. E. coli is considered the most promising bacterial strain for recombinant protein production; however, it lacks machinery for posttranslational modifications that can lead to inefficient protein folding and aggregation (in the form of inclusion bodies) (Stewart et al. 1998; Bessette et al. 1999). Aggregation can affect the biological activity and stability of therapeutic proteins and is considered a risk factor for increased immunogenicity. The major challenges in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies are isolation, washing, solubilization, and refolding procedures (Clark 2001;Middelberg 2002). Much effort is required for the development of a robust procedure for producing industrial-grade proteins that are stable, properly folded, and free from aggregation. \n\nThe co-expression of target proteins with soluble fusion partners for heterologous protein production in E. coli can lead to enhanced expression and efficient purification. Exploiting its chaperoning properties, the SUMO tag allows high-level expression through proper folding of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004;Butt et al. 2005). A high soluble protein expression level can be attained using this fusion system, yielding approximately 30% of the total soluble protein fraction in E. coli (Wang et al. 2010). The SUMO protease recognizes the SUMO fusion partner, facilitating precise proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in the production of native proteins. pET SUMO has been widely used to produce many therapeutically important proteins, including human interferon alpha-2a (Bis et al. 2014), BMP-14 (Li et al. 2011), human interleukin-11 (Nguyen et al. 2018), andFGF-21 (Wang et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Expression of homologs of a protein of interest [13] or removing flexible loops or residues that affect solubility [14] has also led to enhanced solubility rates of proteins for structure determination efforts. These rescue methods involve additional effort, do not always work, and may be cost prohibitive to labs. \n\nWilliams et al., [15] first noted that when insoluble protein expression is observed, proteins might possibly be secluded within inclusion bodies. Indeed, this has become the conventional paradigm; the belief that it's not worth trying to solubilize proteins from E. coli which are apparently insoluble, as they are likely to be trapped within these inclusion bodies. We hypothesize a significant fraction of proteins are not found in inclusion bodies but rather are expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and aggregate after cell lysis. These proteins would appear in the soluble fraction if the cell lysis buffer conditions were adjusted, whether it is by pH, ionic strength or presence of an additive. \n\nProtein aggregation during purification also leads to solubility issues. In recent years Bondos and Bickell [16] have shown that recombinant protein aggregates can be solubilized during the purification process with various buffer conditions. With their method the recombinant proteins need to be present as aggregates in the soluble fraction, which are then disrupted by changing buffer compositions. We took a different approach, tackling the solubility issue earlier, at the cell lysis stage, with the aim to prevent the initial protein aggregation from occurring. \n\nWe describe a screening method with 144 unique lysis conditions followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the soluble fractions to determine conditions that result in an increase soluble recombinant protein. This lysis with additive method is effective in rescuing protein that express as insoluble in E. coli avoiding the need to design new constructs or switch expression systems. Although this technique was developed for a high-throughput structural genomics project, it is applicable to any scale project to screen for increase in protein solubility.",

The cytoplasm of E. coli often fails to provide the optimal environment for the folding of recombinant proteins; therefore, various approaches have been used to overcome this inherent problem [1]. These approaches include: (1) co-expression with molecular chaperones or specific binding partners that may help to fold target proteins [2][3][4][5], and (2) fusion with highly soluble proteins, such as Glutathione S-transferase(GST), Maltose-binding protein(MBP), N utilization substance protein A(NusA) [6], DnaK [7,8], Small ubiquitin-like modifier(SUMO) [9], or Lysyl tRNA synthetase(LysRS) [10], to enhance the solubility of target proteins [11]. Alternatively, approaches based on the chaperone function of RNAs (chaperna; chaperone + RNA) [12], co-expression with a specific RNA ligand [4,5], or fusion with an RNA-interaction domain (RID) [13][14][15] greatly enhances the solubility and the overall yield of soluble proteins. \n\nAlthough there have been many advances in terms of enhancing the solubility of proteins, solubility itself cannot guarantee the adequate biological function of the protein of interest, which is primarily due to the formation of soluble aggregates [16][17][18]. Soluble aggregates are soluble oligomers that form micelle-like structures, which are usually biologically inert. Although fusion with highly soluble partners or co-expression with molecular chaperones may greatly enhance their overall solubility, it has long been observed that these proteins often remain biologically inactive.",

The levels of both oxidized proteins are decreased by GSH in the growth medium. However, addition of a disulfide oxidant to the growth medium does not positively affect the production of either enzyme. These observations are consistent with the idea that the oxidative folding mechanisms of E. coli periplasmic proteins and, by inference, proteins of the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum have evolved to accommodate constraints placed on the folding reaction by the folding environment. The consequences of differences between the folding mechanisms in eukaryotic and prokaryotic disulfide-containing proteins on the expression of eukaryotic proteins in the bacterial periplasm are discussed.\n\nThe production of disulfide-containing eukaryotic proteins in bacterial systems is often complicated by low expression levels and the formation of inclusion bodies.

            "text": "Many studies have focused on optimizing the production processes for recombinant proteins, with the aim of reducing the accumulation of insoluble inclusion bodies. In contrast, solubilization and refolding of protein from inclusion bodies is a common strategy although it requires denaturing conditions and a subsequent renaturing step, usually resulting in poor soluble protein recoveries [32,33]. Different approaches have been developed to prevent the accumulation of inclusion bodies in E. coli, such as the optimization of culture conditions, co-expression with molecular chaperones [34,35], lower growth temperature during gene induction [35,36], induction expression in early-log phase culture [37], and induction with lower levels of inducer concentration, such as Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) [38]. In addition, several fusion tags have been developed to increase the solubility of overexpressed proteins, although with variable degrees of success. Currently, available fusion systems include maltose-binding polypeptide (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ubiquitin (SUMO), thioredoxin (TrxA), and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) [39]. The use of a fusion partner may increase the solubility of the protein and may significantly contribute to an increase in the expression yields under different conditions. The data presented here revealed a higher number (p = 0.05) of proteins obtained in the soluble form when fused with GFP tag (pHTP9) (Figure 3C) compared with proteins that only included a histidine tag (pHTP1). Although this suggests higher solubility through the expression with the GFP fusion, only a controlled study in which the same proteins are expressed in the fusion with the two different fusion tags would allow a more insightful elucidation of the impact of GFP on protein solubility.",

            "text": "The most common E. coli-based expression system is the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter controlled gene expression combination. IPTGinduction of the chromosomally encoded bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase leads to high level expression of T7 promoter-controlled genes and correspondingly high recombinant protein titers. High level recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli frequently leads to an impact on host cell metabolism detectable through growth retardation and generally known as \"metabolic burden\" [1,2]. The factors contributing to the metabolic burden are multifaceted depending on the host/vector combination and on the properties of the encoded gene with its transcription and translation products as well as on the environmental conditions encountered during the production process [3][4][5][6]. The prime reasons for the protein production related metabolic burden have been attributed to protein translation and protein folding [1,6] as well as to transcription and plasmid amplification related processes [7][8][9]. However, production of the same protein under identical conditions in the same host/vector combination but with single codon exchanges can change the metabolic perturbations considerably [10][11][12][13] suggesting that the phenomenon is even more complex than anticipated. \n\nIn this contribution we analyze the impact of T7-promoter-controlled recombinant gene expression on the host cell metabolism using two different model proteins, the difficult-to-fold human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) with its high propensity to form inclusion bodies in E. coli and the easy-to-fold green fluorescent protein (GFP) mainly produced as soluble protein. \n\nFor both examples we generated a set of expression vectors in which either the ribosome binding site (RBS) or the promoter region or both were removed in order to analyze if the plasmid itself, the transcription of the recombinant gene, the translation into the protein product and/or protein folding related processes have an impact on host cell metabolism.",

            "text": "Heterologous proteins that are overexpressed in microbial hosts such as E. coli often accumulate in insoluble clusters called inclusion bodies (IBs). The IBs preferentially localize at the poles of the bacteria, which is thought to be related to the accumulation of dense DNA central in the cells. The IBs vary in size from 0.1 to 1 \u00b5m and although their chemical composition may vary, they consist predominantly of the overexpressed recombinant protein (Ramon et al., 2014;de Marco et al., 2019). Traditionally, IB formation is linked to the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides and seen as an obstacle in production processes aimed at high yields of soluble, active protein species. To avoid aggregation several strategies have been explored including lowering of transcription and translation rates, reduction of the growth temperature and co-expression of chaperones that assist in proper folding (Kaur et al., 2018). Alternatively, IBs can be isolated, denatured and subjected to refolding conditions to regenerate the active protein (Yamaguchi and Miyazaki, 2014;Singh et al., 2015). \n\nRather than being regarded as an undesirable side effect of industrial protein production, the generation of IBs is now increasingly appreciated as a useful strategy to obtain recombinant protein. Proteins in IBs are largely resistant against degradation by host cell proteases and less likely to exert toxic effects in the expression host. In addition, owing to their high density, IBs are easy to isolate from cell lysates by differential centrifugation, providing robust and cost-efficient protocols to obtain large amounts of relatively pure protein (Swartz, 2001;Sahdev et al., 2008;Martinez-Alonso et al., 2009). Moreover, whereas IBs for long were considered to be amorphous aggregates of disordered protein, they actually display a structured \u03b2-sheet organization and can contain significant amounts of protein in a native conformation. This makes them interesting as a supply of nanostructured biomaterial with high mechanical stability, biological activity and slow protein release properties.",

            "text": "Proteins are a class of molecular machines that are engaged in structural and transport components, have enzymatic properties, and play a role in cell signalling. \n\nAs the proteins are in distinct shapes, performing varied functions, each protein owns a unique 3D structure innate with its distinct amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence dictates its primary structure, yet in order to perform its activities the proteins need to fold precisely into an accurate three-dimensional form. The process of protein folding is remarkably efficient and conserved through the evolutionary process [19,20]. Upon translation the proteins are released into the complex cellular environment among several other proteins and biomolecules where several factors come together to catalyse the folding process which is unique to each protein. While advances in recombinant DNA technology have enabled the cloning and expression of almost any protein, yet the fully functional state can only be achieved when the proteins are provided with uniquely optimized conditions for its folding. Understanding the folding process is the most fundamental step towards production of these proteins under non-native conditions such as an industrial set-up. Due to the long amino acid sequence the number of possible conformations is very large, however the native structure involves interaction between residues that are stable and lowest energy structures. Chaperones are molecular catalysts that help the protein to reach this conformation [21]. Cellular stress conditions bring about episodes of massive protein misfolding. Under such conditions the level of molecular chaperones substantially rises providing evidence that they rescue misfolded proteins providing them with another chance to refold. This type of intervention requires energy, which is why many of the chaperones require ATP to function [22]. Overexpression of heterologous proteins also imposes stress like conditions in E. coli which is one of the most extensively utilised expression host organisms for the creation of recombinant proteins. This results in a considerable amount of the produced protein accumulating as an insoluble mass devoid of biological function. The cellular chaperones are insufficient to fold such large amounts of proteins. Therefore, the co-expression of molecular chaperones along with the recombinant proteins is an effective strategy for enhancing the solubility of proteins [23][24][25].",

            "text": "Recombinant proteins produced in the thermoinduced \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 expression system can form aggregates in the cytoplasm, accumulate in soluble form either in the cytoplasm or the periplasmic space, or be secreted to the supernatant [7,65,125,149]. The site of protein accumulation depends on proper localization signals [125]. Production of recombinant proteins in the periplasmic space offers several advantages, such as decreased proteolytic activity compared to the cytoplasm, simpler purification protocols as fewer host proteins are present in the periplasm, and minimum amounts or even absence of undesirable isoforms and posttranscriptional modifications. Furthermore, the in vivo cleavage of the signal peptide provides authentic N-terminus of the target protein without an extra methionine). Another advantage is that correct formation of disulfide bonds can be facilitated because the periplasmic space provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm [14,125]. Until now, few examples of soluble recombinant protein expression in periplasm using the \u03bbpL/pR-cI857 system have been reported [125,142]. \n\nThe increased temperature and high production rates alter protein folding, which in turn favors protein aggregation into inclusion bodies (IB) when using the \u03bbpL/ pR-cI857 system [65,137,149,150]. The factors that determine IB formation include the nature of the protein expressed (v. gr., protein sequence), growth and induction conditions, cytoplasmic reducing environment, kinetic competition between aggregation and folding, high local protein concentration, inappropriate interactions with in vivo folding chaperones, intermolecular disulfide crosslinking (although proteins lacking cysteines can still form inclusion bodies), medium composition, and bacterial strain [137,[150][151][152][153]. Accumulation of the recombinant protein in IB has certain advantages, as it can be isolated and concentrated by a simple centrifugation step, reducing the downstream processing costs and facilitating the production of toxic proteins to cells [154][155][156].",

E. coli is one of the preferred hosts of choice for the preparation of therapeutic proteins because of its simplicity, fast growth, and low-cost fermentation process [15,16]. The soluble expression of functional HSA in E. coli is the major difficulty for investigators. In earlier attempts, rHSA was expressed in E. coli but the majority of the protein expressed is insoluble, in the form of inclusion bodies [17,18]. It is known that the majority of the overexpressed proteins that have hydrophobic patches, undergo post-translational modifications or have disulfide bonds are primarily at the risk to form such amorphous aggregates [21]. HSA is a large multidomain disulfide-rich protein and it is often difficult for a disulfide bond rich protein to fold in its functional form under the normal reducing physiological environment of the E. coli cells. \n\nIn the present study, we have targeted and eventually resolved the prime limitation associated with the negligence of E. coli as a host for rHSA production. We have developed a process to overcome an unbalanced (See figure on previous page.)

However, most of the eukaryotic proteins are typically obtained as insoluble, misfolded inclusion bodies that need solubilization and refolding. Reteplase as a highly disulfide-bonded recombinant protein is an example of difficult to express protein in E. coli. Methods: In this study, a codon optimized reteplase gene was synthetically prepared and cloned under the control of an IPTG inducible T7 promoter. The vector was simultaneously transformed and expressed in three different E. coli strains. The ability of strains for expression of this recombinant pharmaceutical was compared. Also, an attempt was made to increase the soluble production of reteplase in SHuffle T7 E. coli with alterations of expression condition like temperature, inducer concentration and oxygen supply. Results: High amounts of reteplase were expressed as inclusion bodies in all three strains. BL21 (DE3) showed the highest level of expression in inclusion bodies followed by Rosetta-gami (DE3) and Shuffle T7. Changes of expression conditions were insufficient for soluble expression of reteplase in SHuffle T7 as a genetically engineered host for production of disulfide bonded proteins. Conclusion: The oxidizing cytoplasm of Rosetta-gami and Shuffle T7 in addition to alterations of cultivation parameters could not result in soluble production of reteplase, although the inclusion bodies produced in these two strains might increase the rate of refolding procedure likely due to formation of folding intermediates.",

Notably, an amorphous matrix fills the spaces between and inside the inclusion bodies, conceivably allowing diffusion of reactants. However, the characteristics of individual proteins greatly impact both whether the aggregates avoid degradation and whether active proteins (enzymes) can be incorporated.

As solubility is an initial criterion for determining the quality of recombinant proteins, various approaches have been used to increase their solubility [2,6,10,11]. However, guidelines for the quality assessment of soluble proteins have neither been proposed nor critically validated experimentally. Here, we employed the popular cell-lysis methods of sonication and mild lysis to examine the folding status of soluble proteins. EGFP was used as the folding reporter, owing to its distinct functional (with chromophores) and non-functional (without chromophores) forms, which can be identified by fluorescence and physico-chemical behavior in well-adapted gel electrophoresis (Figure 1C,3C) [23]. Here, soluble aggregates of EGFP were intentionally formed using an RNA-binding defective solubility enhancer [14,26]. \n\nThe physical properties, primarily solubility after centrifugation and the status of mono-dispersity/oligomerization determined by SEC, were compared with the functional (fluorescence) and biochemical properties represented by different migration velocities in SDS-PAGE, which were dependent on chromophore formation. Mild lysis in a detergent buffer does not increase the local temperature, or generate free radicals that induce protein aggregation as sonication does [19,20]; however, we found that the solubility of sonicated samples was far better than that of mildly lysed samples (Figures 1 and 5).

            "text": "However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production. [1,4,5] rotein expression in E. coli generally takes place in either cytoplasm or periplasmic space. Reductive environment of the cytoplasm tends to express the proteins into inclusion bodies due to inefficient formation of disulfide bridges, whereas periplasmic space is the preferred choice for the soluble expression due to presence of oxidizing environment for proper folding. Antibody fragments are engineered with signal sequence for directing them to periplasmic space for proper folding. [6,7] he resultant periplasmic extract is thereby already enriched for the recombinant protein of interest, with the periplasmic containing only around 4-8% of the natural E. coli cellular proteins, making purification simpler. The periplasmic extract is also of lower volume than a whole cell lysate. In addition, periplasmic protease activity is far lower than that in the cytoplasm, reducing proteolysis of the recombinant protein product. [6] arious reports have shown that increased production of recombinant antibody fragments have soluble expression below 30 C. Lowering the cultivation temperature during induction increases the refolding of protein and reduces aggregation due to the lowered translation rate. Control of the growth temperature during fermentation is a facile method that allows stable expression of heterologous proteins. A direct consequence of temperature reduction is the partial elimination of heat shock proteases that are induced under overexpression conditions. [8] A similar transcriptional effect is achieved when a moderately strong or weak promoter is used or when a strong promoter is partially induced. [3] Low induction levels have been found to result in higher amounts of soluble protein. [9] It was concluded that the low temperature was beneficial to folding and the system was suggested as a tool for expression and correct folding of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Temperature downshift to 15 or 23 C abolished degradation of the fusion protein and the toxic phenotype associated with expression at 37 C was suppressed.",

Due to the reversibility of protein aggregation in bacteria, several strategies are employed to isolate and refold inclusion bodies since they are a good source of reasonably pure polypeptides, which could provide protein in the native conformation after refolding [62]. Inclusion bodies almost exclusively contain the over-expressed recombinant protein and very little host protein, ribosomal components or DNA/RNA fragments [63]. Protein refolding is a complicated procedure requiring several optimization steps [64]. Solubilization of inclusion bodies results in soluble protein in its nonnative conformation, which needs to be refolded [64]. \n\nThe inclusion of chaotropic reagents ensures the successful formation of the native structure [64,65] by allowing intra-molecular interactions and/or preventing intermolecular interactions. \n\nSirawaraporn et al showed that disaggregated and refolded P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from inclusion bodies yielded active protein in sufficient amounts for enzyme function determinations [34]. Optimal refolding of P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-1 resulted in an enzymatically active monomeric form of this protein, which exhibited high immunogenic activity [66]. \n\nRefolding procedures were also used to obtain high levels of P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2, resulting in the crystallization of this protein [67]. Immunologically active P. falciparum 42 kDa MSP1 42 was obtained by refolding of MSP1 42 as a fusion protein from inclusion bodies [68]. Due to the undesirability of fusion tags in clinical trials, refolding protocols were utilized to obtain the first recombinant form of P. falciparum MSP1 42 without a 6\u00d7 His affinity tag [69].",

            "text": "Although production of a protein as insoluble aggregates can offer the advantage of easy purification, a protein solubilized by some appropriate process such as urea treatment does not have a guarantee that it has the native protein conformation. Thus, large-scale production of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli in soluble form is the first step for structural studies. \n\nThe mechanism by which proteins become soluble is not understood. The formation of inclusion bodies might be thought as \"inappropriate\" protein-protein interactions due to the lack of proper polypeptide folding (2,3). Why are many eukaryotic proteins produced as insoluble aggregates in E. coli? Two factors appear to affect the solubility of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli. The first parameter is the E. coli heat shock chaperone GroESL (encoded by the groE operon, Fig. 1). The role of the GroESL complex in catalyzing the correct folding of a newly synthesized polypeptide has become firmly established recently (4 -7). To produce eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, a strong promoter like the T7 promoter is often used. In this case, a high level of production of the E. coli chaperones GroESL may be needed. For example, when phage infects E. coli, the production of GroESL is induced. If the level of functional GroESL does not increase, phage cannot form the phage particles, because the folding of coat proteins does not occur correctly (8). Thus, the coordinate induction and high level production of E. coli chaperones may be required for proper folding of the foreign proteins. The second parameter that affects the solubility of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli could be the difference of redox state between E. coli and eukaryotic cells. Most of the fusion proteins with GST1 (glutathione S-transferase) containing various mammalian proteins produced in E. coli bind to glutathione-Sepharose beads very efficiently.",

These proteins are genetically fused to a signal peptide so that they are secreted to the oxidizing environment of the periplasm (where the enzymes required for disulfide bond formation exist). Currently, it is difficult to determine in vivo whether a recombinant protein is efficiently secreted from the cytoplasm and folded in the periplasm or if there is a bottleneck in one of these steps because cellular capacity has been exceeded. To address this problem, we have developed a biosensor that detects cellular stress caused by (1) inefficient secretion of proteins from the cytoplasm and (2) aggregation of proteins in the periplasm. We demonstrate how the fluorescence fingerprint obtained from the biosensor can be used to identify induction conditions that do not exceed the capacity of the cell and therefore do not cause cellular stress. These induction conditions result in more effective biomass and in some cases higher titers of soluble recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production is an essential tool for the biotechnological industry and supports expanding areas of basic and biomedical research, including structural genomics and proteomics. The solubility of proteins expressed in bacteria under mass-production conditions is of major concern, since many recombinant polypeptides produced in bacteria accumulate as insoluble, often refractile, aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) [49], excluding many biotechnologically relevant protein species from the market due to economically inconvenient yields. To date, the solubility of a given gene product has not been anticipated before gene expression. The comparison between the AGGRESCAN output values for proteins shown to be soluble under overexpression condi-tions in E. coli and those forming inclusion bodies shows that they share a similar number of HSs per 100 residues (NnHS), an expected output when considering that most proteins in both datasets are globular. However, IB-forming proteins have higher Na 4 vSS values than soluble proteins, suggesting that soluble proteins have, on average, a lower intrinsic aggregation tendency than IB-forming species, which may determine, at least partially, their relative behaviour upon overexpression. Overall, the predicted aggregation of proteins in the SCOP database is intermediate between that of soluble and insoluble proteins, suggesting that, in agreement with experimental observations, only a part of them would remain in the soluble cell fraction upon recombinant production. \n\nAlthough AGGRESCAN is able to catch the average trends in the aggregation of IBs and soluble protein groups, the individual outputs for proteins from both groups overlap significantly, making the prediction of the recombinant behaviour of a given sequence difficult in its present form. Besides, aggregation during recombinant production is the net result of several extrinsic and intrinsic factors, their relative importance depending on the protein and expression contexts.",

            "text": "Nazari A et al. recombinant antibodies by this bacterium is limited due to the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). IBs are aggregates of over-expressed misfolded proteins that lack correct structure and hence are biologically inactive (17). To overcome this problem, several strategies have been developed, including periplasmic expression by the aid of signal peptide, expression in low temperature/low inducer concentration, and fusion with solubility-enhancing tags and co-expression with molecular chaperones. It has shown that the co-expression of ScFv with molecular chaperones facilitates the correct folding of the recombinant antibodies (18). The classes of cytoplasmic chaperones that have an important role in protein folding are GroEL, DnaK, GroES, Tig, DnaJ, and GrpE. It has been shown that the co-expression of ScFvs and the chaperone plasmids PG-tf2 (GroES-GroEL-tig), ptf16 (tig), pGro7 (GroES-GroEL), pKJE7 (grp E-dnaJ-dnaK), and pG-KJE8 (groES-groEL-dnaK-dnaJ -grpE) leads to a noticeable increase in the expression of soluble proteins (19,20). These chaperone plasmids contain pACYC-the origin of replication and carry a chloramphenicol-resistance gene (Cmr), araB and/ or Tet promoters, which can be induced by L-Arabinose and Tetracycline. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cytoplasmic chaperones on the expression of soluble humanized anti-EGFR scFv in E. coli (21). \n\nIn addition, we evaluated the effects of culture and induction condition on the solubility and the activity of the recombinant scFv co-expressed with selected chaperones.",

            "text": "Advancements in inclusion body resolubilization and protein refolding have led to a better understanding of the forces governing inclusion body formation and of methods used to efficiently refold proteins of interest [14,15]. To generate a sufficient amount of purified protein from inclusion bodies it is necessary to isolate the inclusion bodies from the E. coli lysate, solubilize the inclusion bodies and then refold the protein of interest [12]. The first two steps are relatively straightforward often requiring mechanical disruption (e.g. French Press or sonication) and centrifugation to lyse the E. coli and isolate the inclusion bodies followed by the addition generally of chaotropic agents (e.g. GuHCl or Urea) to solubilize them. It is the refolding of the protein of interest that is often the limiting step with aggregation and improper disulphide bond formation being two major issues to overcome. During protein refolding, aggregation of partially folded intermediates can result in a significant decrease in final yields. L-arginine, a natural amino acid, is commonly used to enhance protein refolding by suppressing protein aggregation [16,17]. To aid in proper disulphide bond formation, the inclusion bodies are first solubilized in a solution containing a reducing agent such as DTT or 2-mercaptoethanol. These are used to disrupt any non-native disulphide bonds and must be removed, often by dialysis, before proper disulphide bond formation can proceed in the refolding process. During refolding, a combination of reduced and oxidized thiols (e.g. glutathione), are used to promote disulphide exchange [12]. It is thought that this is most effective when the protein is forming its secondary and tertiary structure so that the cysteinyl residues are in the correct proximity to each other [18]. \n\nWe describe in detail here a straightforward method to refold and purify rhGM-CSF from inclusion bodies that generates milligram amounts of active protein from a single litre of E. coli.",

            "text": "The bacterium Escherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. To fold properly, many recombinant proteins have to be targeted to the E. coli periplasm, but so far the impact of the targeting pathway of a recombinant protein to the periplasm has not been extensively investigated. Here, we show that the targeting pathway of a recombinant antibody fragment has a tremendous impact on cell physiology, ultimately affecting protein production yields in the periplasm and biomass formation. This indicates that studying the targeting and secretion of proteins into the periplasm could be used to design strategies to improve recombinant protein production yields. ABSTRACT Many recombinant proteins that are produced in Escherichia coli have to be targeted to the periplasm to be functional. N-terminal signal peptides can be used to direct recombinant proteins to the membrane-embedded Sec translocon, a multiprotein complex that translocates proteins across the membrane into the periplasm. We have recently shown that the cotranslational targeting of the single-chain variable antibody fragment BL1 saturates the capacity of the Sec translocon leading to impaired translocation of secretory proteins and protein misfolding/aggregation in the cytoplasm. In turn, protein production yields and biomass formation were low. Here, we study the consequences of targeting BL1 posttranslationally to the Sec translocon. Notably, the posttranslational targeting of BL1 does not saturate the Sec translocon capacity, and both biomass formation and protein production yields are increased. Analyzing the proteome of cells producing the posttranslationally targeted BL1 indicates that the decreased synthesis of endogenous secretory and membrane proteins prevents a saturation of the Sec translocon capacity. Furthermore, in these cells, highly abundant chaperones and proteases can clear misfolded/aggregated proteins from the cytoplasm, thereby improving the fitness of these cells. Thus, the posttranslational targeting of BL1 enables its efficient production in the periplasm due to a favorable adaptation of the E. coli proteome. We envisage that our observations can be used to",

            "text": "Production of recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli can induce several stress responses [1][2][3] and may interfere with primary metabolism and cellular protein synthesis [4][5][6]. The metabolic burden of the syn-thesis of recombinant and stress proteins [7,8] may result in stop of the synthesis of components of the protein synthesising machinery, and ribosomes may be actively degraded [4,9,10]. Most commonly, the heat-shock response is induced, as the recombinant proteins -unable to fold properly -overload the chaperone network [11,12]. While appropriate execution of stress responses is of vital importance for the host Escherichia coli [13], the high metabolic load of strong foreign protein production can prevent proper adaptation [14,15]. The stress situation can become permanent, and only few cellular proteins except heat-shock proteins are synthesised. \n\nAnalogously, incubation at extreme temperatures is characterised by near exclusive heat-shock protein synthesis as a consequence of extensive aggregation of cellular proteins [18,19]. To deal with this challenge, the chaperone DnaK changes its function: Under physiological conditions, DnaK promotes folding of kinetically trapped intermediates by ATP-dependent partial unfolding, but at high temperatures it becomes a holding chaperone and binds its client proteins permanently, unable to release them in a folding-competent conformation [20]. \n\nThe small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are intrinsic holding chaperones of multimeric structure. The multimers dissociate at high temperatures into smaller entities for exposure of client binding sites. After binding of misfolded client proteins, the sHsps form large globular assemblies [21]. Thereby, they prevent irreversible aggregation, and under permissive conditions transfer the client proteins to ATP-dependent chaperones for refolding or degradation [22,23].",

            "text": "The polyhistidine tag was added to the N terminus of FeAPL1 cDNA without the signal peptide. This tag is poorly immunogenic, small at pH 8.0 and uncharged, and hence does not generally affect compartmentalization or folding of the fusion protein and thus its structure and function. \n\nThis system proved very efficient since a large amount of rHis 6 -FeAPL1 (50 mg/l culture) was produced and purified on Ni-NTA resin. However, the crucial problem was the almost complete insolubility of the fusion protein. Factors that might be involved in the formation of inclusion bodies are: a high local concentration of recombinant protein; the reducing environment of the E. coli cytoplasm, which prevents disulfide bond formation; the lack of post-translational modification; improper interactions with chaperones and other enzymes involved in folding in vivo; intermolecular cross-linking via disulfide bonds and other covalent bonds; and increased aggregation of folding intermediates due to their limited solubility. The primary structure of FeAPL1 largely contributes to its insolubility. It contains twelve cysteine residues able to form disulfide bonds. Since all these residues are conserved within the AP-like group, they are certainly important for proper folding into the correct structure and, therefore, functionality of the enzyme. There is no evidence whether all cysteines are included in disulfide bond formation or not. Probably due to the inability of disulfide bond formation, the protein starts to fold improperly, exposing insoluble hydrophobic regions and, together with the factors mentioned above, is prone to aggregation. \n\nFor this kind of cysteine-rich protein, it is very challenging to find conditions throughout isolation that will enable the formation of correct intramolecular disulfide bonds instead of intermolecular disulfide bonds leading to protein aggregation. Decreasing the amount of produced protein (decrease of IPTG concentration and/or time of induction), lowering the temperature-increase of protein solubility, and induction of different E. coli growth phases did not give any positive results. Therefore, purified His 6 -FeAPL1 from inclusion bodies was subjected to several refolding methods in different buffers.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic proteins are frequently produced in Escherichia coli as insoluble aggregates. This is one of the barriers to studies of macromolecular structure. We have examined the effect of coproduction of the E. coli thioredoxin (Trx) or E. coli chaperones GroESL on the solubility of various foreign proteins. The solubilities of all eight vertebrate proteins examined including transcription factors and kinases were increased dramatically by coproduction of Trx. Overproduction of E. coli chaperones GroESL increased the solubilities of four out of eight proteins examined. Although the tyrosine kinase Lck that was produced as an insoluble form and solubilized by urea treatment had a very low autophosphorylating activity, Lck produced in soluble form by coproduction of Trx had an efficient activity. These results suggest that the proteins produced in soluble form by coproduction of Trx have the native protein conformation. The mechanism by which coproduction of Trx increases the solubility of the foreign proteins is discussed. \n\nProduction of large amounts of proteins in Escherichia coli is a first step for structural studies of macromolecules. However, many eukaryotic proteins, especially full-length proteins, are produced in E. coli as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies). Our laboratory is interested in the three-dimensional structure of transcription factors, especially nuclear oncogene products such as the myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb). We identified the solution structure of the Myb-DNA complex by using the bacterially produced Myb protein containing the DNA-binding domain alone (1). However, the structural study of the fulllength Myb has been unsuccessful, because it was produced in E. coli as insoluble aggregates. Although production of a protein as insoluble aggregates can offer the advantage of easy purification, a protein solubilized by some appropriate process such as urea treatment does not have a guarantee that it has the native protein conformation.",

GroES and GroEL were well known to work in cooperation in the folding process [22,23]. With the help the chaperone proteins GroES and GroEL, the recovery of the soluble trun-OcUGlcAE proteins from inclusion bodies increased, as shown in the supporting material Figure S2. Next, these E. coli crude extract expressing trun-OcUGlcAE proteins were applied to examine their activities in a total reaction volume of 100 \u03bcL. After incubation at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min, twenty microlitres supernatant was directly analyzed by HPLC. As illustrated in Figure S3, there are no specific peaks corresponding reaction products in the three reaction mixtures, suggesting no activities toward UDP-GlcA occurred in these OcUGlcAE proteins (Figure S3). The unavailability of active recombinant enzymes was present when trun-OcUGlcAEs were expressed in E. coli, presumably due to the N-terminal truncation that resulted in improper folding and decreased stability of these recombinant proteins. Three full-length OcUGlcAE proteins were therefore heterologously expressed in P. pastoris for active recombinant enzymes.",

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology.",

            "text": "(ThT), which are also used to identify and characterize amyloid fibrils 25,26 . The presence of aggregates with amyloid fibril morphology has been observed for inclusion bodies of E.coli expressing A\u03b2 peptide shown by electron microscopy and AFM 27 . Inclusion body formation has been exploited for purification of several recombinant proteins, because of the ease of isolation from the majority of soluble E. coli proteins by repeated sonication and centrifugation 28 . While expression of soluble short unstructured peptides and proteins may lead to rapid proteolysis and poor yield, the formation of inclusion bodies protects peptides from degradation and enables the tag-free expression of A\u03b2 peptides 29 . \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated a connection between formation of inclusion bodies and the propensity to form amyloid fibrils 25,27,[30][31][32] . Here we ask whether such a correlation can be utilized to build a screening method for identification of A\u03b240 peptide variants with increased or decreased aggregation propensity. An earlier method using green fluorescent protein fused to A\u03b2 as a reporter of A\u03b2 misfolding made it possible to screen for variants with decreased aggregation propensity only 33 . We also investigate if there is a correlation between the amount of inclusion bodies formed and measures of overall aggregation rate in vitro, such as the time it takes until the reaction is half completed, the steepness of the transition or the concentration dependence of the reaction. We use an A\u03b240 mutant library of the wild-type protein and 24 single mutation variants (Fig. 1 and see Supplementary Table S1), in which we have changed all charged positions to oppositely charged or neutral hydrophilic amino acid residues, and all His and Asn residues to charged ones. The rational for this design comes from earlier studies that indicated that electrostatic interactions strongly affect the aggregation kinetics of A\u03b2 peptides 16,18,20,22,34 . Using a charge mutant library should thus provide a benchmark for an inclusion-body-based screening method.",

            "text": "As the host, Escherichia coli is fundamentally important in the manufacture of a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical products, owing to its easy culture, fast growth, simple fermentation and easy genetic manipulation [1]. High production of recombinant protein in E. coli is a combination of several factors such as efficiency of transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA folding, codon usage, protein solubility and folding [2]. So, the strategies for optimizing expression greatly vary from gene to gene and are often determined by trial and error. \n\nIn E. coli, tRNA levels for rare codons AGG, AGA, AUA, CCC, CUA and GGA restrain high-level production of the recombinant proteins [3]. Codon optimization could enhance soluble protein production [4,5], but sometimes it also impaired protein folding and decreased activity [6,7]. Similarly, supply of deficient tRNAs increased expression levels of recombinant proteins, but decreased soluble production of some recombinant proteins [8]. So far, obtaining well-folded recombinant proteins with high yield remains a major challenge, as yield, solubility and conformational quality of soluble proteins could not be simultaneously optimized in E. coli [9]. \n\nFusion tags are frequently applied for improving protein solubility and facilitating rapid purification by affinity chromatography. To avoid potential interference with biological activity or crystallization, the fused tags need to be removed, which is often achieved by a specific protease that recognizes and cleaves the engineered sequence between the tag and target protein [10]. Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) has been identified as a tool, owing to its stringent recognition sequence. Production of wild type TEVp or the mutant TEVpS219V with inhibition of auto-cleavage in E. coli is limited due to its low solubility [10].",

            "text": "Therefore, the co-expression of molecular chaperones along with the recombinant proteins is an effective strategy for enhancing the solubility of proteins [23][24][25]. E. coli also possess an in-built mechanism to cope with physiological stress conditions. When bacterial cells are subject to stress such as osmotic and heat-shock they adapt themselves to overcome it by synthesizing bio-molecules and endogenous heat-shock proteins that can evade the harsh effects and help in normal functioning of the cells [26]. The influence of various process parameters on the expression, solubility, and activity of recombinant proteins during co-expressed chaperonemediated folding was investigated in this study. GroEL is one of the best characterized molecular chaperones, possessing a cavity which holds the unfolded protein away from the cellular environment, folds it and then releases it [27]. Yeast mitochondrial aconitase, an 82 kDa monomeric Fe 4 S 4 cluster containing enzyme has been used as a model protein in this study as it was found to fold both in vivo and in vitro through multiple rounds of binding and release with both GroEL and GroES. The recombinant protein aconitase is severely aggregation prone under the physiological growing conditions of E. coli and are rescued from forming massive non-functional, nonnative aggregates by assistance of GroEL/ES chaperones [13]. \n\nIn this work the gene for aconitase was cloned in pET29 under the strong T7 promoter and expressed in BL21(DE3). The transformed cells were retransformed with pGro7 for expression of GroEL/ES. The optimal growth temperature plays the most critical role on the growth rates, cellular biomass, recombinant protein expression, solubility and activity thus defining the quantity and quality of the exogenous protein produced in the cellular milieu. The rate of synthesis of the foreign proteins is rapid at higher temperature which leads to the quick accumulation of the nascent polypeptides without reaching its native structural conformation [28]. The large mass of intermediate proteins with exposed hydrophobic patches invites for various non-covalent interactions both weak and strong.",

            "text": "Since E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium, bacteriocin production can be confined to the cytoplasm where it can accumulate in a soluble form or aggregate in insoluble inclusion bodies, or can also be secreted into the periplasmic space or into the culture medium. Several factors including protein size, amino acid composition, and the type of leader peptide can affect bacteriocin translocation to these locations (reviewed in Mergulhao et al., 2004).\n\nMost bacteriocins use a dedicated secretion machinery in their natural hosts to export the bacteriocin to the extracellular media. However, the production of active bacteriocins directly to the culture medium by cloning their whole operons in E. coli has been reported on a limited number of occasions (Figure 2) (Caetano et al., 2011a;Mesa-Pereira et al., 2017). Generally, the overexpression of cloned native genes leads to bacteriocin accumulation in inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. At first glance, the formation of inclusion bodies could be advantageous as the expressed bacteriocins are inactive and protected against host proteases, facilitating their purification and a high protein yield. However, this aggregation can affect the host metabolism and additional steps (inclusion body isolation, solubilization of the aggregates, and protein refolding) are required for their purification, limiting their large-scale production (Mergulhao et al., 2004).\n\nThe processing and the correct folding of bacteriocins as well as their recovery can be simplified when the peptide is secreted into the E. coli periplasm or into the culture medium. To achieve that, signal sequences of proteins recognized by a general protein secretory pathway (sec pathway), such as the maltose-binding protein malE (Miller et al., 1998), the pectase lyase secretion signal pelB (Ingham et al., 2005), and the outer membrane protein ompA (Zhang et al., 1995), have been fused to the bacteriocin sequence for targeting their secretion to the periplasm. In addition, the bacteriocin divergicin A signal peptide has been used to direct",

Molecular chaperones lie at the heart of protein quality control, aiding the nascent polypeptide to reach their final structure i.e. native form [31][32][33][34]. During overproduction of a recombinant protein, endogenous chaperone concentration is likely to be limited which may result in inclusion body formation. However, if chaperones are overexpressed concomitantly with the recombinant protein in vivo then they can help in the preferred folding of the expressed recombinant protein [35,36]. Despite numerous publications reporting large quantities of soluble recombinant protein with the assistance of chaperones in E. coli [37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45], no report is found till date on the attempts to fold rHSA in E. coli cytosol with the help of co-expressed chaperones. We exploited the opportunity to introduce molecular chaperones (GroEL-ES and TF) to assess the effect on the functional preparation of rHSA in the second phase of the process. \n\nTo our surprise, it was found that the expression of rHSA increased by twofold when co-expressed along with the TF chaperone, whereas it was diminished to a negligible level when co-expressed with GroEL-ES chaperone system as compared to when rHSA was expressed without any exogenous chaperone assistance (Fig. 4). This observation could be attributed to the fact that GroEL-ES chaperone is an ATP dependent chaperone and a cell over-expressing a tetra-decameric GroEL and a heptameric GroES along with the recombinant protein of interest undergoes stress, which can limit the cellular ability for recombinant protein synthesis [46][47][48]. Since the amount of the total expressed rHSA in presence of GroEL-ES system was too low, it led to diminished activity values when compared to the control.",

            "text": "One of the greatest drawbacks to obtain high recombinant protein yields with E. coli is the formation of inclusion bodies and protein precipitation, due to high expression, incorrect folding, aggregation, or low chaperone activity (Gopal and Kumar, 2013). Recombinant protein precipitation involves, in addition to a decrease in the yield of the production process, an alteration in the gene transcription of the strain (Baig et al., 2014). Hence, to optimize a large-scale recombinant protein production process, it is essential to know what proportion of the protein forms precipitates and what fraction remains in soluble form, and therefore functional for most subsequent applications. In order to know the percentage of soluble and insoluble YFP protein, batch cultures were carried out with E. coli growing under the conditions corresponding to the maximum expression observed for each vector (Figure 5). When cultures reached the stationary phase, soluble/insoluble fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometric analysis. Electrophoresis gels are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Figure 5 results showed that insoluble YFP protein was present in all cultures. However, cultures where YFP was expressed under P BAD promoter control showed lower insoluble fraction. Moreover, cultures containing pSF-p15A-trc-YFP and pSF-p15A-tac-YFP vectors, of which YFP expression was the highest, showed a similar percentage of soluble and insoluble protein. This difference observed in the amount of protein precipitated according to the expression plasmid used is very relevant, since it is useless to achieve a high expression if most of the protein is precipitated together with the cell pellet. Therefore, this aspect should be studied previously when selecting an expression system, especially if we are faced with a protein with limited solubility.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been used as an expression host for the production of a wide range of recombinant proteins (Baneyx 1999;Baneyx and Mujacic 2004). Several expression systems have been developed for the high-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli (Makrides 1996). Among the various expression systems used, the temperature-inducible expression system has been beneficial due to the ease of induction and higher induction strength (Seeger et al. 1995;Gupta et al. 1999). \n\nHowever, the use of temperature up-shift as an induction mechanism influences several cellular processes, including the up-regulation of the heat shock proteins such as molecular chaperones and proteases (Hoffmann et al. 2002;Weber et al. 2002). \n\nThe role of induction mechanism on recombinant protein production has been investigated for certain recombinant proteins in the literature. For an aggregation prone recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, the temperature-induced expression was found to result in increased productivity and higher yield (Seeger et al. 1995). In the case of soluble Chloramphenicol Acetyl Transferase (CAT) the productivity of the temperatureinducible system was lower compared to chemicallyinduced system (Harcum and Haddadin 2006). Further, the global transcriptome response of recombinant E. coli producing soluble recombinant CAT was analyzed during chemical induction, temperature induction and dual induction conditions (chemical and temperature induction). The transcriptome response of the classical heat shock genes was found to be similar in the wild-type and dual stressed cultures, even though many other genes were found to be differentially expressed in these cultures. This indicates that modeling the dynamics of the heat shock proteins and their mechanism of interaction with the recombinant protein could give useful insights. \n\nThe role played by the various heat shock proteins in assisting solubilization, folding and degradation of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been extensively reviewed by Hoffmann and Rinas (2004).",

The fluorescence emission does not present significant differences at different production times. However, in general terms, it is possible to conclude that GFP activity increases at longer production times, being this effect more marked in the soluble fraction (Figure 2). Besides, it is worh mentioning that at 3 h post-induction, protein solubility reached 67%, a yield much higher than that reached in E. coli for the same protein under comparable conditions (10-18%, [34]). In this context, the potential of the system for the soluble protein production was confirmed with a difficult-to-express human catalase, which under these conditions majorly occurred at the soluble cell fraction (75%) (data not shown). On the other hand, the conformational quality, namely the ratio between protein activity and protein yield, of soluble rVP1GFP (estimated through its specific fluorescence) (Figure 5) evolved contrarily to the resulting protein amount in cells (Figure 2). This means that those conditions that favour protein solubility are those giving non-optimal results regarding conformational quality. Interestingly, such a divergence between protein yield and quality has been previously described in recombinant E. coli [29,35], but the present finding confirms this fact as a generic event.",

Results: Single recombinant antigens (Ant2 and Ant3) and fusion proteins (Ant2-3 and Ant3-2) formed insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) when overexpressed in BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) cells. Further, proteolytic cleavage of Ant2-3 was observed, potentially due to the presence of a large un-structured loop between the protein boundaries. Optimisation of culture conditions such as varying the induction temperature and addition of heat-shock inducer benzyl alcohol to the growth media had no significant effect on the processing and protein production pattern for all four antigen molecules. Changes to the construct design to include N-terminal solubility tags (Thioredoxin and N utilisation substance protein A) did not improve solubility. Screening of different buffer/additives to improve stability showed that the addition of 1-15mM dithiothreitol (DTT) alone improved the stability of both Ant2 and Ant3. Structural models were generated for Ant2 and Ant3 and solubility-based prediction tools were employed to determine the role of charge and hydrophobicity on protein production. The results showed that both Ant2 and Ant3 contained unfavorable features associated with poor solubility. A large non-polar region was detected on the surface of Ant2 structures, whereas, positively charged regions were observed for Ant3.Conclusions: Commonly used strategies to enhance recombinant protein production in bacterial systems did not act to increase production of model \u2018difficult-to-express\u2019 antigens,",

However, very often the target protein accumulates into insoluble aggregates in a misfolded and biologically inactive form. Bacterial inclusion bodies are major bottlenecks in protein production and are hampering the development of top priority research areas such structural genomics. Inclusion body formation was formerly considered to occur via non-specific association of hydrophobic surfaces in folding intermediates. Increasing evidence, however, indicates that protein aggregation in bacteria resembles to the well-studied process of amyloid fibril formation. Both processes appear to rely on the formation of specific, sequence-dependent, intermolecular interactions driving the formation of structured protein aggregates. This similarity in the mechanisms of aggregation will probably allow applying anti-aggregational strategies already tested in the amyloid context to the less explored area of protein aggregation inside bacteria. Specifically, new sequence-based approaches appear as promising tools to tune protein aggregation in biotechnological processes.",

            "text": "One of the major challenges during expression screening is the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. These often contain large quantities of active protein, leading to strong GFP signals that cannot be distinguished from the homogeneous fluorescence of soluble proteins during FACS. This issue could be addressed by including a biosensor for inclusion body formation. The transcriptomic response to inclusion body formation has been investigated, and offers multiple starting points (Baig et al., 2014). The expression of a second fluorescent marker in the presence of inclusion bodies would allow such cells to be excluded, resulting in the specific gating of cells expressing soluble recombinant proteins. \n\nWe confirmed that V. natriegens is a suitable host for recombinant protein production, especially in the case of uricase. Although, uricases from other species have been produced successfully in E. coli (Nakagawa et al., 1995;Shaaban et al., 2015), this is not the case for L. sericata uricase and we were similarly unable to identify any E. coli clones that produced this enzyme in significant amounts. In contrast, V. natriegens produced large amounts of the enzyme in a soluble form. \n\nWe found that many of the functional elements in E. coli expression constructs could also be used in V. natriegens, including the ssYahJ secretion signal. Most of the lucimycin product was detected in the V. natriegens periplasmic fraction, and the presence of an additional smaller product indicated the cleavage of the secretion signal (Figure 6A). In E. coli, proteins fused to thioredoxin can be released from the cytoplasm by osmotic shock (Ajouz et al., 1998), but it is unclear whether this also occurs in V. natriegens. We expected to detect most of the Trx-uricase fusion protein in the periplasm (Figure 7) so it is unclear why the same fusion protein combination leads to the periplasmic localization of lucimycin. The abundance of insoluble uricase indicates incomplete or incorrect folding of the large fusion protein.",

            "text": "Protein folding is one of the great unsolved problems of modern molecular biology. Not only is this question intrinsically fascinating, but it is closely tied to a wide range of applications and debilitating diseases, which are of critical importance in both biotechnology and molecular medicine. Most proteins that require chaperones to fold efficiently are poor folding models for biophysical experiments and, conversely, proteins suitable for in vitro folding studies do not require chaperone assistance. The complete characterization of a protein model, as MalE, and the availability of both in vivo and in vitro approaches, complementing each other, make it a particularly attractive system for mechanistic studies of this central issue. Our understanding of a number of cellular factors relevant to protein folding and assembly has increased enormously during the past five years, and quite remarkable progress has been made in the applications of this knowledge.\n\nAlthough many alternative organisms and expression systems are now being developed, the most widely used host for high-level expression of recombinant proteins remains E. coli. Many important proteins for therapeutic or diagnostic applications including secreted enzymes contain disulfide bonds that are required for correct folding. Thus, studies on periplasmic protein folding have significant ramifications for biotechnology. However, many of these proteins are produced in biologically inactive and aggregated forms (IBs). Although solubilization and refolding procedures exist to obtain functionally soluble proteins, as well demonstrated with MalE31, they are lengthy processes, and not generalisable. For these proteins, modification of the amino acid sequences by mutagenesis, the folding code, may be one way to isolate a soluble form, and we can envision that genetic screens or selections for the rapid identification of correctly folded proteins expressed in the bacterial periplasm will be developed.\n\nOther potential applications include the use of envelope folding factors as targets for the development of new antimicrobial drugs. Indeed, several proteins involved in periplasmic protein quality control are either essential or play an important role in the virulence of many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.",

Although many recombinant proteins have been successfully obtained from common prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, these systems result to be often unproductive due to the peculiar properties of the protein to be produced. Incorrect folding of the nascent polypeptide chains is one of the main problems occurring during heterologous protein production in bacteria. Since formation of inclusion bodies often impairs the recombinant production of valuable proteins, many experimental approaches have been explored to minimize this undesirable effect [1,2]. Expression of \"difficult\" proteins has also been carried out by lowering the temperature at the physiological limit allowed for the growth of mesophilic host organisms (between 15 and 18\u00b0C for Escherichia coli). Lowering the temperature, in fact, has a pleiotropic effect on the folding process, destabilising the hydrophobic interactions needed for intermediates aggregation [3]. On the basis of the above considerations, a rational alternative to mesophilic organisms is the use of naturally cold-adapted bacteria as hosts for protein production at low temperature (even at around 0\u00b0C).",

            "text": "Protein misfolding, formation of inclusion bodies, and proteolytic degradation are common problems associated with of recombinant expression in E.coli. In spite of these problems, E.coli is still a preferred expression host due to its robustness, ease of manipulation, time and cost effectiveness and high yields compared to other expression systems like insect or mammalian cells. We chose to express VP1 in the bacterial system in conjunction with a Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag. It is well documented in literature that the fusion of highly soluble GST to partners prone to misfolding or aggregation is an efficient and effective approach for the production of soluble and correctly folded protein. VP1 is hydrophobic in nature and there could be a high possibility of its misfolding or aggregation when expressed in E.coli, which could be potentially overcome by the inclusion of GST. However, we found that our His-GST-VP1 fusion protein was tightly associated with the bacterial chaperone GroEL, and co-eluted with the chaperone upon size-exclusion chromatography. We confirmed that the association is primarily due to the VP1 component, however, implementation of multiple strategies such as protein expression at reduced temperature, inclusion of detergents and chaotropes, expression in ArcticExpress cells, separation by ammonium sulphate precipitation or ATP gradient, were all unsuccessful in separating recombinant VP1 from bacterial chaperones. It has recently been shown that too tight of an association between the client protein and chaperone may slow protein folding drastically, and a moderate level of binding is required to obtain optimal results [33]. It is possible that the association between HAV VP1 and GroEL is unusually tight, which hinders correct folding and release of VP1 from the chaperone. Attempts to decipher the structural basis of the interaction of GroEL with the recombinant protein was unsuccessful due to the current low resolution of asymmetric 3D reconstruction of the His-GST-VP1-GroEL complex.",

            "text": "Due to unsuitable folding of protein, most of the heterologous proteins expressed in E. coli aggregate in inclusion bodies which are partly or completely devoid of biological activity. Solubilization of these aggregates requires denaturing agents in a high concentration causing the loss of secondary structure of protein. Moreover, after refolding, the obtained proteins might be unstable. Therefore, focusing on environmental modification, many investigations have tried to develop expression of well folded highly soluble proteins in E. coli during the past three decades 13 . \n\nThe RSM and ANN models for optimized soluble production of scFv were studied here for the first time. Also, here, the effects of four numerical factors along with different strains as a categorical factor on response were investigated for the first time. Based on the developed quadratic model, temperature and induction OD were not significant and the other three terms (post-induction time, concentration of inducer and different strains) were found to be significant for soluble production of scFv. In agreement with our study, many investigations showed the influence of different E. coli strains on solubility of various proteins. For example, the effect of different engineered hosts including BL21(DE3) pLysS, BL21(DE3) and Rosetta on soluble expression of recombinant TNF-\u03b1 was assessed by papaneophytou et al. Their results showed lower yield of soluble TNF-\u03b1 in Rosetta compared to the other two hosts 14 . The effective role of the engineered strains on solubility demonstrated here is also in line with Zhang et al.'s study which has showed the higher solubility of IGF1-thioredoxin fusion in Rosetta-gami (DE3) than that in Rosetta (DE3) and Bl21 (DE3) bacteria 15 . Herein, the maximum soluble amount of scFv was achieved in E. coli Origami(DE3) which is a type of mutant strain with mutation in thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase (gor) genes. Its oxidative environment enhances disulfide bonds formation in the cytoplasm which leads to lesser accumulation of misfolded proteins and inactive inclusion body formation 16 .",

Reteplase shows decreased affinity to fibrin which allows free diffusion and better penetrance in blood clots instead of binding only on the surface 23 . \n\nReteplase is famous as an aggregation-prone protein in E. coli since contains multiple disulfide bonds and reductive environment of cytoplasm does not let correct disulfide bond formation resulting in generally misfolded and biologically-inactive inclusion bodies 2,24   . Refolding of inclusion bodies elongates the time of drug production. The efficiency of refolding may be low and refolded enzymes might be unstable due to incomplete refolding or incomplete removal of detergent and denaturants used in this process. Therefore, it is often desirable to obtain high degrees of soluble protein. Till now there is no universal approach for efficient soluble production of aggregation-prone recombinant proteins 25,26 but several strategies like introduction of molecular chaperons to the host bacteria, modulation of expression level, optimization of culture medium, reduction of temperature, addition of chemical chaperons have helped in preventing protein aggregation 27 . \n\nIn the current study, an attempt was made to express reteplase in three different strains of E. coli and compare their ability for soluble expression and production yield of this recombinant protein. E. coli BL21 (DE3) is the most common prokaryotic strain used for expression of recombinant proteins till now 19,28 . Previous reports on tPA expression in BL21 (DE3) strain show that common strategies failed to produce soluble protein in this strain but aggregated inclusion bodies are extracted for refolding procedure 29 . \n\nRosetta-gami B (DE3) is a hybrid strain engineered to enhance the expression of genes containing rare codons. At the same time, it can enhance disulfide bond formation in the cytosolic fraction due to mutations of trxB and gor genes.",

            "title": "Quality Screening of Incorrectly Folded Soluble Aggregates from Functional Recombinant Proteins",
            "text": "One possibility is that for multi-domain proteins, one domain is properly folded and thus highly soluble, whereas one or more remain unfolded or partially folded in an aggregation-prone state, causing the whole protein to form soluble aggregates like micelles [16]. Multi-domain proteins usually fold in a co-translational manner [27], where the folding of the N-terminal domain significantly affects the subsequent folding of downstream C-terminal domains [28]. The induction of recombinant protein expression is typically accelerated by over-expression; thus, the continual translation of a protein in high amount may exceed the folding capacity of the recombinant host, with any imbalance between translation and folding speeds resulting in incorrectly folded aggregates [1]. These problems associated with aggregation-prone proteins can be circumvented by fusion with a highly soluble carrier protein or co-expression with a chaperone [6,8]. These approaches often successfully increase the overall solubility of target proteins, but do not guarantee their functional quality, resulting in soluble, non-functional aggregates [16,18]. \n\nVarious tools have become available for improving the yield of recombinant proteins [1,2,10,29]; however, most approaches still rely on routine sonication during the initial purification step, with solubility as initial criterion of protein quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that solubility is necessary, but not sufficient to determine biological function. Thus, screening out the non-functional fraction at the beginning of purification is necessary to control the quality of the proteins produced by recombinant technology. The same guidelines also apply to various approaches to circumvent inclusion body formation: fusion with highly soluble proteins [6][7][8][9][10][11], co-expression with molecular chaperones or specific binding partners to assist target protein folding, or harnessing the chaperna function of RNAs [12]. \n\nIn conclusion, mild lysis is a useful method for screening out non-functional soluble aggregates during the early stages of purification to improve the overall quality of the protein of interest. The results of this study also highlight the importance of the folding environment in recombinant hosts on both the solubility and functional activity of proteins.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production is a leading methodological platform of biotechnology and biomedicine [1]. Protein misfolding, degradation, aggregation, inclusion body formation and low functional protein quality are among the main obstacles encountered when using conventional bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli [2][3][4] as cell factories, these events being specially distressing when proteins are intended for therapeutic uses [5,6].\n\nApart from shifting to a growing number of alternative hosts, what might eventually improve protein yield and quality, several strategies have been implemented to favour recombinant protein yield and quality in bacteria, specially addressed to enhance proteolytic stability and minimize aggregation [3,7]. As the activities of the cell's quality control were identified ( [8], and references therein), the co-production of chaperones along with the target protein was taken as a routine approach. Firstly individual chaperones, and later chaperone-cochaperone pairs or larger chaperone sets, supplied from additional plasmid vectors, have been assayed as folding modulators under different experimental setting ups and for a large catalogue of proteins [9]. Despite reports of 1 Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article relevant successes, a consensus about final doses and composition of the best chaperone catalogue has not been reached, as the positive effects of this strategy seem to be highly dependent, among other potential factors, on the specific recombinant protein. In addition, externally supplied chaperones might show side effects on the whole physiology of recombinant cells and eventually compromise the quality, solubility or yield of the target recombinant protein [10,11]. Such undesired effects might limit the success of this method, and their occurrence can account, at least partially, for the lack of consistency of chaperone co-production as a generic strategy.\n\nDnaK, a key negative regulator of the quality control system and the main cytosolic E. coli chaperone (acting together with its co-chaperone DnaJ) is a common component of the most successful chaper",

            "text": "To screen recombinant spidroin expression in different E. coli strains, nine commercially available strains were used in this work (Supplementary Table 1). Some strains were chosen based on factors previously shown or hypothesized to affect recombinant silk production, such as codon usage and inclusion body formation. These strains include RosettaGami B, which has upregulation of seven tRNAs for rare codons including those for glycine and proline, as well as BLR, which has a recA \u2212 mutation that may facilitate increased stability of plasmids containing repetitive sequences (Yedahalli et al., 2016;Huemmerich et al., 2004;Karla et al., 2005). The strain SoluBL21 has been developed through directed evolution to produce soluble protein when its ancestral strain, BL21(DE3), does not yield detectable soluble product. Likewise, strain pGro7 expresses a chaperone protein that prevents inclusion body formation and promotes soluble production (SoluBL21 Competent E. coli, 2022;Nishihara et al., 1998). The remaining strains were chosen to potentially identify unknown targets for the optimization of recombinant spidroin expression. This includes strains HMS174 and MG1655, which unlike other strains tested, are from the K-12 E. coli lineage instead of the B lineage (Hausjell et al., 2018;Leal-Ega\u00f1a et al., 2012;Bachmann, 1972). Strain pLysS restricts basal expression, while strain Origami B contains mutations that change the cytoplasmic environment and cellular stress responses through alterations to the thiol-redox equilibrium, glutathione metabolism, and oxidative stress response (Studier and Moffatt, 1986;Kong and Guo, 2014;Lobstein et al., 2016;Kunert et al., 1990). All strains used in this study were DE3 lysogens and proteins were expressed from the pET19b vector under control of the T7 promoter. We additionally studied a tenth hybrid strain, SoluBL21-pLysS, which we developed by combining features from pLysS and SoluBL21.",

These polypeptides were produced as non-fused, pseudo wild type versions or joined to a hydrophobic viral protein (the VP1 capsid protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus) that acts as an efficient aggregation tag. While GFP is a monomeric small protein (27 kDa) that gains activity through a maturation process in the last folding steps [30], \u03b2-galactosidase is a huge tetrameric protein (470 kDa) that becomes active once the correct contacts between the monomer's interfaces have been stabilized [31]. Point mutations in GFP have a dramatic impact on the aggregation rate of the protein [32] while disposition of both GFP (and related fluorescent proteins) and \u03b2galactosidase as inclusion bodies is also sensitive to the amino acid sequence and position of end-terminal fused aggregation tags [33][34][35]. Aggregation-prone versions of both proteins have been shown to interact in vivo with GroEL [36][37][38].\n\nTo minimize the contribution of thermal stress on protein deposition we tested recombinant protein production at two suboptimal growth temperatures, namely 16\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C. The non-fused GFP was fully soluble when produced in E. coli at 16\u00b0C ( Figure 1A). However, around 40% of recombinant GFP occurred in the insoluble cell fraction when the culture temperature was upset to 27\u00b0C ( Figure 1A). Co-production of GroELS did not improve GFP solubility in any of these production conditions ( Figure 1A). Also, GFP yield was very similar in all cases, excluding the possibility of extended proteolysis mediated by the chaperones. In contrast, the aggregation-prone version of the same protein (VP1GFP) was mainly ins",

            "text": "Temperature is a crucial factor that affects cell growth and protein production [14]. This factor also affects the substrate consumption rate, the quality of the product, and process duration. Since the culture medium temperature increases the rate of protein synthesis, it may not provide enough time for the correct protein folding [4,15]. Many attempts have been made to improve folding and solubility during the expression. One of the most commonly used strategies is changing bacterial growth conditions [7]. Although the temperature drop to less than 37 \u2022 C in E. coli causes a reduction in specific growth rates [16]. We investigated the effect of various temperatures on the yield of extracellular production of nanobody and cell biomass. Generally, low temperature leads to slower cell growth and protein expression. Decreased cell growth resulted in reduced consumption of carbon source and increased dissolved oxygen, which results in decreased acetate [16,17]. SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 6) revealed that glycine in autoinduction medium could effectively promote the release of recombinant nanobody, possibly due to its impact on fatty acids leading to increased cell membrane fluidity and permeability [1,6,18]. The expression of recombinant protein in the form of soluble and biologically active are advantages in comparison to the inclusion body (insoluble form) as the various steps, including refolding, could be avoided in downstream processing. In this study, the conventional induction (IPTG inducer) which produced insoluble recombinant protein in E. coli is compared with the autoinduction strategy for soluble expression of nanobody. Based on previous reports, the maximum amount of extracellular production occurred at the lower concentration of glucose and at the higher concentration of glycerol [7,11,19]. The high concentration of glucose in the medium causes catabolic repression and also the production of byproducts such as acetate [20]. Moreover, this causes the increase of acidity of the medium and reduction of target protein production [2]. In contrast to the results obtained for glucose, glycerol has a positive impact on target protein production.",

            "text": "In recent research, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has established itself as one of the most extensively used systems in the industrial production of recombinant proteins, which owes much to the high yield of production that is possible with this system, the low manufacturing cost, a wellcharacterized expression system, and amenability to high cell-density fermentation biotechnology [1,2]. In addition, due to a lack of appropriate folding-assistance proteins and cofactors that can mediate post-translational modifications, the likelihood of inclusion body formation is considerately high when heterologous proteins are expressed in E. coli [3]. However, continuous endeavors have been devoted to overcome such limitations. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering strategies, there are many solutions that can potentially provide successful expression of soluble recombinant proteins in an E. coli expression system, including choosing a suitable expression host and vector, codon usage, sequence optimization, inducer concentration, expression temperature, fusion technology and co-expression of a chaperone. \n\nTherapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals have been applied widely particularly in respect of the broader interest in recombinant technology. These proteins are required in sufficient quantities; however, it remains a challenge to obtain enough proteins from natural sources. To express eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, the concept of fusion technology represents an effective method to enhance protein solubility [4]. In a contemporary study, fusion expression vectors provide useful tools to strengthen the solubility and productivity of eukaryotic proteins, including Maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance A (NusA), Thioredoxin A (Trx) and translation initiation factor 2 domain I (IF2). Furthermore, it has recently been determined that fusion partners like the Fasciola hepatica 8 kDa antigen (Fh8), the E. coli secreted protein A (EspA) and KDPG aldolase (EDA) have emerged with the intent of improving synthetic yields, enhancing solubility and folding processes and simplifying the purification of eukaryotic proteins [3][4][5].",

            "text": "Polypeptides entrapped in E. coli inclusion bodies exhibit a variable degree of folding organization under different production conditions [19,24]. Such degree of folding is frequently correlated with the \"quality\" of inclusion bodies because it has an impact on the yield of refolding and, therefore, the overall economy of the production process [45,46]. This led me to explore the impact of using codon-optimized sequences on the ability of the resulting inclusion bodies to yield active chymosin. The refolding efficiency obtained for inclusion bodies recovered from recombinant clones expressing the seven individual variants were very similar, suggesting that the tested DNA sequences did not alter the conformational quality of protein contained in the inclusion bodies. \n\nVariations in the rate of mRNA translation may influence the formation of secondary structures in the nascent polypeptide [47,48], and analysis of gene sequences and the structure of their encoded proteins show that frequently used codons are associated with structural elements, while strings of less used codons tend to be present in boundaries separating such elements. Thus, a redesigned gene where most abundant codons are placed to encode secondary structures (like alpha helices) and rare codons are placed to encode linkers, may lead to the formation of inclusion bodies of superior quality. In the redesigned genes tested in this work, codon assignment frequency was equally distributed all along the entire gene. A calf prochymosin gene designed taking into account the sequence/structure relationship may provide insights into the influence of codon optimization on the refolding efficiency. This work is currently in progress in our laboratory.",

            "text": "The combinations of different expression vectors and E. coli strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. Since the fumI gene contains a restriction site for NcoI, pET vectors that enable gene insertion at an NdeI site covering the translation initiation codon were chosen. Initially, the fumI gene was cloned into vector pET-30a (+) for low background expression based on the T7lac promoter. When the gene was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by induction with 1 mM IPTG at 37\u00b0C, most of the aminotransferase was found in the insoluble fraction of cell lysate (Fig. 2). Since our efforts to refold the aminotransferase from solubilized inclusion bodies by dialysis or dilution remained unsuccessful, we attempted to increase the yield of soluble, correctly folded protein produced in recombinant E. coli. We had previously observed when using other recombinant proteins that E. coli(DE3) strains can produce considerable amounts of recombinant protein from a gene cloned under control of a T7 promoter even in the absence of IPTG. So the fumI gene was cloned into vector pET-3a, which does not contain a lac operator sequence downstream of the T7 promoter. E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-3a-AT or pET-3a-HISAT was grown at 37\u00b0C without IPTG for low level recombinant gene expression, which might be beneficial for correct folding. However, aminotransferase FumI still accumulated in inclusion bodies. Addition of 2.5 mM betaine or 600 mM sorbitol, which were previously proposed as solubility enhancers [43], to LB medium for expression failed to increase the yield of soluble aminotransferase. Pyridoxal phosphate, which is a co-enzyme of aminotransferase FumI, likewise showed no effect when added to the medium at a concentration of 1 mM.",

Inclusion bodies are complex and their mechanisms of formation remain debated. Recently, it was discovered that inclusion bodies are rich in \u03b2-sheets and can be combined with amyloidtropic dyes, suggesting that they are related to the formation of amyloids [3,4]. \n\nTo date, researchers have used fusion tags on protein expression to facilitate soluble expression of recombinant proteins, and a variety of tags have been developed including Spy [5], Flag [6], GST [7], Trx [8], Sumo [9], NusA [10], and MBP [11].

Factors, such as lack of glycosylation, easier production, high expression levels, high cell densities, and low production costs compared to other available expression platforms contribute to popularity of the E. coli platform. \n\nThe last few decades have witnessed significant advancements in cloning strategies, expression, and purification, thereby resulting in improved production of useful antibody-like fragments utilizing E. coli expression system. [1,2] he production process is typically quite simple. The desired gene of interest is cloned into a suitable expression vector, which is further transformed into choice of host, cultivated and induced, and protein is extracted and purified. Post purification, the protein is further characterized for structure and function. [3] However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

            "text": "for CWGT production in E. coli, combining several approaches. Firstly, to avoid the pitfall of an individual CWGT being significantly more challenging than the average, and to be able to draw general conclusions about CWGT behavior as recombinant proteins, we screened a large number of genes, including well-characterized, partly characterized, and putative CWGTs from A. thaliana as well as several crops. Each gene was included in full-length and in several truncated forms, to minimize errors introduced in N-terminal truncation as well as incorrectly predicted gene boundaries and other bioinformatic shortcomings. Secondly, as CWGTs typically contain several cysteines, redox state control could prove key to successful protein folding and thus soluble heterologous expression. Notably, the secretory pathway, including the Golgi lumen, provides a more oxidizing environment than the cytosol [8], where recombinant protein translation and folding typically takes place in E. coli. To explore this parameter, we included the E. coli Origami\u2122 strain in our screen. This cell line has mutations in the thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase genes, enhancing disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm [9]. We also included a vector for periplasmic expression, since the periplasm is the most oxidizing cellular compartment for protein expression available in E. coli [10]. In the same vein we included an expression vector that produces a fusion protein with thioredoxin. Thioredoxin has been shown to mediate correct folding of recombinant proteins by proximity, either acting as a chaperone or through its oxidoreductase activity [11]. Finally, the availability and stoichiometry of aids to folding, such as chaperones, will be different in the Golgi lumen compared to the cytosol [12,13]. To compensate for these differences, we screened co-expression of several combinations of chaperones, including GroEL/GroES, DnaJ/DnaK/GrpE and Trigger Factor. We have applied this multidimensional screen to a total of 46 CWGTs (Table 1) from 12 different plants covering 11",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for protein production. Despite decades of progress in heterologous protein expression, the folding of many proteins, especially large multi-domain eukaryotic proteins, remains a significant challenge [1]. Heterologous protein production can account for up to 50% of E. coli's total cellular protein content and thus puts strain on the native transcriptional and translational machinery [2]. Additionally, the speed of coupled transcription and translation in bacteria can be problematic for producing large eukaryotic proteins. Key protein folding factors from the native host are also absent, causing further protein folding problems. Combined, these factors can lead to misfolding and/or aggregation of the recombinant protein [3]. Over the years many strategies have been developed to improve heterologous protein production [1,4,5]. \n\nFor each recombinant protein being expressed, numerous variables influence the amount of soluble protein being produced by the cell including the protein sequence, expression vector, cell line, and expression conditions. Many of these factors may need to be optimized to achieve expression of active, soluble protein in E. coli. Upon selecting the protein of interest (POI) to be expressed, several avenues to improve protein solubility can be explored. A protein sequence can be altered by eliminating rare codons, reducing stretches of hydrophobic residues, or simply by selecting alternative homologs of the desired protein to increase chances of successful expression. [6][7][8]. Any changes to the protein sequence itself come with the risk of altering the activity of the protein. Once a protein sequence has been selected, the appropriate expression system must be designed. The promoter, origin of replication, and the inclusion of solubility tags (MBP, DsbC, SUMO, NusA, etc.) can all be altered to enhance protein expression [6,[9][10][11][12]. After designing and building the vector harboring the POI, an E. coli expression strain must be chosen. There are many strains that have been engineered for the purpose of heterologous protein expression which are reviewed here [13].",

Proteins with high molecular mass are usually not used as fusion partner because the big fusion partners may reduce the actual amount of target protein that is obtained after the fusion partner is removed. PpiB (18 kDa), Bfr (19 kDa), YjdC (22 kDa), FolA (18 kDa), CheZ (24 kDa), and GshB (36 kDa) are relatively small proteins compared with the other proteins above and were also the most effective in enhancing the solubility of hG-CSF. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the N-terminus fusion of six stressresponsive proteins led to a significant increase in both the expression level and solubility of hG-CSF. Inclusion body formation presumably occurs due to protein overexpression in a heterologous environment in which nascent polypeptide chains are continuously synthesized and then aggregate because of nonspecific hydrophobic interactions among the partially folded intermediates of the recombinant proteins, various host proteins, or a combination of the two within the cytoplasm. In many cases, broad exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on newly synthesized polypeptides results in intermolecular aggregation and misfolding. To prevent such occurrences, molecular chaperones (DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system, GroEL/GroES, etc.) that recognize and interact with hydrophobic patches of nascent proteins can be used (Maier et al., 2005). Hydrophobic amino acids are usually buried within the core of folded proteins but become exposed in the partially folded polypeptide intermediates (R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997;Suh et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression does not always lead to obtaining a soluble, pure, and homogeneous product. Many target proteins can accumulate as insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies, or are expressed at very low yields. To circumvent these obstacles, several parameters that enhance protein stability and folding leading to the production of a functional protein can be evaluated (Vincentelli et al., 2011;Correa and Oppezzo, 2015). However, the evaluation of some factors including different promoters, distinct cellular localization or an alternative host, may require the cloning of the target gene into multiple vectors. In the present study, we have expanded our vector suite also for the evaluation of recombinant protein expression in different cell compartments as well as alternative hosts. By using RF-cloning, the same megaprimer can be now introduced in a parallel manner into the 20 vectors of our extended suite. \n\nIn addition to success in recombinant protein expression, the final yield will also depend on the employed purification method. For example, there are several native proteins from E. coli that can interact with metal-chelating resins including the ones used for IMAC, and are commonly eluted with the target. This is especially important when working with proteins that are expressed at low yields, making the purification process difficult and leading to product loss (Bolanos-Garcia and Davies, 2006). With this in mind, we extended the purification options and included a vector for fusion with GST under the control of the T7 promoter, pT7GST. The GST protein has been extensively used as a solubility-enhancer protein that also allows single-step purification by interacting with glutathione resins and elution is performed under mild conditions with reduced glutathione (Smith and Johnson, 1988;Harper and Speicher, 2011). With the generated pT7GST vector and if the stop codon of the target gene is avoided, three affinity tags will be available allowing purification of the target through the HisTag, GST fusion and/or Strep-Tag R II. By using fusion with GST, a rapid and effective purification method was designed were recombinant proteins can be obtained in an almost pure state from cell pellets within 3 h.",

            "text": "BackgroundProtein over-expression in bacteria is still the easiest, cheapest and therefore preferred way to obtain large amounts of proteins for industrial and laboratory scale preparations. Several studies emphasized the importance of understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by protein over-production in order to obtain higher yield and better quality of the recombinant product. Almost every step leading to a fully functional polypeptide has been investigated, from mRNA stability to the role of molecular chaperones, from aggregation to bottlenecks in the secretory pathway. In this context, we focused on the still poorly addressed relationship between protein production in the cytoplasm and the bacterial envelope, an active and reactive cell compartment that controls interactions with the environment and several major cellular processes. Results available to date show that the accumulation of foreign proteins in the cytoplasm induces changes in the membrane lipids and in the levels of mRNAs for some membrane proteins. However, a direct connection between membrane protein expression levels and soluble/aggregated protein accumulation in the cytoplasm has never been reported.ResultsBy the use of a combined physiological and proteomic approach, we investigated the effects on the cell membrane of E. coli of the overexpression of two recombinant proteins, the B. cepacia lipase (BCL) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Both polypeptides are expressed in the cytoplasm at similar levels but GFP is fully soluble whereas inactive BCL accumulates in inclusion bodies.Growth and viability of the transformed cells were tested in the presence of different drugs. We found that chloramphenycol preferentially inhibited the strain over-producing GFP while SDS was more effective when BCL inclusion bodies accumulated in the cytoplasm. In contrast, both proteins induced a similar response in the membrane proteome, i.e. increased levels of LamB, OmpF, OmpA and TolC. Under all tested conditions, the lipopolysaccharide was not affected, suggesting that a specific rather than a generalized rearrangement of the envelope was induced.ConclusionTaking together physiological and biochemical evidence, our work indicates that the E. coli envelope can sense protein over-expression in the cytoplasm and react by modulating the abundance of some membrane proteins, with possible",

In the purification process developed here only the bacteriocin encoded by orf030 gene was obtained in the soluble fraction, the other ones were recovered from the insoluble fraction. Fahnert et al. [40] reported that overexpression of recombinant proteins can be lethal for the E. coli host, yielding to inactive inclusion bodies associated with the specific folding of these proteins [40]. The formation of the inclusion bodies may be an advantage for bacteriocin purification as they can remain protected from the deleterious actions of the host proteases [36]. In addition to these two hypotheses, expression of these bacteriocins in other hosts like lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts could be advantageous. In this study, the inclusion bodies were solubilized with 4 M of urea. Urea is a chaotrope molecule that at high concentrations can lead to denaturation of the secondary structures of proteins. It is used to inhibit protein aggregation during the folding process, improving the recovery of bioactive proteins [41]. The solubilized inclusion body proteins are refolded by removal of the solubilisation agent. In this study, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was used for refolding of solubilized proteins.",

Also, an attempt was made to compare the ability of the three different strains in the T7-based production of this recombinant pharmaceutical. \n\nSeveral research groups have also reported the ex-pression of reteplase in E. coli strains, resulting in the formation of inactive inclusion bodies which need to be renatured to gain biological activity. Since there are 9 disulfide bonds, renaturation of reteplase is very difficult with low efficiency [11][12][13][14] . Furthermore, the refolding procedures may not fully restore the native protein fold and may reduce recombinant protein function 15,16 . At the same time, there are few reports which claim soluble production of reteplase in E. coli. For instance, display of reteplase on the surface of polyhydroxybutyrate granule using phasin as the affinity tag prevented the aggregation of this protein but the final protein needed a thrombin cleavage step for isolation of reteplase 2 . Also, translocation of reteplase to priplasmic region of E. coli Top10 under the control of an arabinose promoter has produced negligible amounts of soluble protein 13 . Since these methods are inefficient for high level production of soluble reteplase, still refolding of inclusion bodies is the method of choice. Therefore, in this study, common approaches were used to increase the yield of soluble and active reteplase production in SHuffle T7 as a genetically engineered E. coli which is suitable for production of disulfide-bonded proteins 17 . Moreover, the effect of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentrations, temperature of expression and oxygen supply were investigated in order to find a way to produce remarkable amounts of biologically active and soluble form of reteplase in E. coli.",

            "text": "Chaperones assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state and provide a quality control system that refolds misfolded and aggregated proteins. In the E. coli cytosol, the folding of newly synthesized proteins is assisted by the ribosome-associated Trigger Factor, the DnaK system (DnaK with its DnaJ and GrpE cochaperones; KJE), and the GroEL system (GroEL with its GroES cochaperone; ELS) [1][2][3][4]. KJE and ELS also prevent aggregation and promote refolding of preexisting proteins which lost their native conformation e.g. due to thermal denaturation or intrinsic instability [5,6]. KJE furthermore cooperates with ClpB to solubilize aggregated proteins and refold them to the native state in a concerted action with ELS [7][8][9]. Moreover, the small heat shock proteins (sHSP) of E. coli, IbpA and IbpB (IbpAB), intercalate into protein aggregates and thereby facilitate the KJE/ClpB dependent disaggregation and refolding [10][11][12]. \n\nThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation [13][14][15][16][17]. Folding problems of overproduced client proteins can be caused by limitations in the chaperone capacity of the host cells. Several attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded, and hence soluble, recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of individual chaperones in producing cells, however only with a limited success. For example, the co-overproduction of ELS increases the solubility of human ORP150, human lysozyme, p50 csk protein tyrosine kinase, phosphomannose isomerase and fusion protein PreS2-S'-\u03b2-galactosidase and maize protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase [18][19][20][21][22][23].",

            "text": "After investigating the characteristic growth parameters (Figure 7A), SDS-PAGE analysis of soluble ( Figure 7B) and insoluble ( Figure 7C) protein fractions was performed. The aim was to investigate if the ratio between soluble and insoluble protein fractions may cause the different respiration behavior of Type A and B clones. Equally for all clones, protein bands in the soluble fraction can be detected after 4.5 h. This correlates with the onset of product formation after 5 h ( Figure 7A). Then, the amount of protein increased until 6 to 7.5 h and remained constant until the end of the cultivation. The SDS-PAGE analysis of the insoluble protein fraction shows traces of target protein after 6 h. Subsequently, an enormous increase in insoluble protein was observed until the end of the cultivation. These results suggest that protein expressed at the beginning of the production phase was folded correctly and remained in the soluble protein fraction. With increasing biosynthesis of the target proteins, a correct folding may increasingly be impeded and incorrectly folded proteins accumulate as inclusion bodies. As a result, the recombinant protein production can trigger various stress responses, e.g. heat-shock-like responses [24,59,60]. Inclusion bodies mainly consist of the recombinant protein, however, co-precipitation during the process of inclusion body preparation causes certain amounts of cellular protein to be included [61][62][63]. Beside insoluble cell proteins, this could also be an explanation for the additional protein bands shown here ( Figure 7C). Besides protein overexpression, the histidine tag present in all target proteins might also promote the formation of inclusion bodies [64]. A previously described effect of the copy number on the rate of product accumulation [63] was not observed in our investigations. The four clones (Figure 7) show different maximum copy numbers but very similar protein contents in the soluble and insoluble protein fractions. Since the ratio of insoluble to soluble protein (Table 3) was roughly the same for all clones, this factor could be eliminated as a reason for the different respiration behaviors of Type A and Type B clones.",

            "text": "The large mass of intermediate proteins with exposed hydrophobic patches invites for various non-covalent interactions both weak and strong. Morphologically aggregates of the synthesized proteins as inclusion bodies were clearly visible in the E. coli cells grown at 37 \u00b0C both in presence and absence of chaperones while no such aggregates were observed at 25 \u00b0C. Efficiency of the strong promoters is usually affected at low temperatures decreasing the rates of expression. The low enthalpy and the reduced molecular movements give the protein moieties the time-period for its folding to attain the native structural conformation before the cytosolic environment become crowded and saturated with misfolded polypeptides [29]. The slow rates of cellular metabolism at low temperatures directly contributes to the reduction in the transcriptional and translational rates. In E. coli cells grown at lower temperatures, exhibited slower growth rates and reduced cellular densities but the aconitase folding increased as shown in the improved solubility and enzymatic activity. The increase in the enzymatic activity was more pronounced in the cells grown at 25 \u00b0C, when the aconitase solubility was 65% of the total expressed protein. Furthermore, the E. coli cells grew comfortably at 25 \u00b0C even though a decline in the substrate utilisation rate has been reported. The chaperoning activity of GroEL/ES in the cells grown at 30 \u00b0C showed better increment in the recombinant protein activity and solubility than at any other incubation temperatures. The enhanced ability of the GroEL/ES to hydrolyse the ATP molecules at 30 \u00b0C, is the reason for its improved chaperoning activity. In order to utilize the benefit of chaperone co-expression optimally, the cells need to be incubated at 30 \u00b0C. Increasing the amount of GroEL/ES by exogenous expression, improved the solubility and activity of aconitase indicating the demand for the co-expressed chaperones in the cytoplasm for assisting the proper folding of the nascent polypeptides. It also indicates that the endogenous chaperones present at the physiological conditions are not sufficient for the folding of the recombinant proteins.",

            "text": "In contrast, proteins expressed in E. coli at lower temperatures in the range of 18 \u2022 C to 25 \u2022 C can form aggregates in the inner membrane or periplasmic space and are released to the supernatant in soluble formation; several advantages of low temperature include reduced proteolytic activity, simpler purification protocols due to fewer host proteins, correct formation of disulfide bonds, etc. [41]. Additionally, lower temperatures can stabilize refolded enzymes and lead to lower protein expression rates, so that newly transcribed recombinant proteins have enough time to fold correctly or properly [42]. As a consequence, low temperature can enhance the refolded yield of recombinant proteins produced in E. coli and is therefore usually selected to induce the production of heterogenous proteins [43][44][45][46]. However, some previous studies have demonstrated that lower temperatures may limit bacterial cell growth by disrupting an early step in protein synthesis, which leads to low recombinant protein yields [47,48]. In our study, FtsZ protein was produced as an inclusion form after induction with IPTG at 16-37 \u2022 C (Figure 1C); the highest expression level (approximately 1 mg/mL) of FtsZ protein was obtained after induction with 0.2 mM IPTG for 5 h at 37 \u2022 C (Figure 1D). Furthermore, ultrasonic lysis of bacterial cells at 97.5 W was more effective than at 162.5 W or 227.5 W (Figure 2A-C), which may be linked to an increase in protein denaturation [49]. \n\nProper concentrations of imidazole may result in a higher purity of the eluted sample. In our work, the recombinant FtsZ protein was eluted by a solution supplemented with 500 mM imidazole, with a higher yield of 25 \u00b5g/mL and purity of >90% (Figure 2D); this result was different from those in previous studies, in which higher protein yield and purity were achieved with 300-350 mM imidazole [50,51].",

            "text": "DISCUSSION DISCUSSION DISCUSSION DISCUSSION Aggregation of recombinant disulfide-bonded proteins in E. coli is a direct consequence of the lack of disulfide bond formation, proceeding from an intermediate present during the unfolding/refolding transition [24] . Under physiological conditions, E. coli cytoplasm is maintained in a reduced state that strongly disfavors the formation of stable disulfide bonds in proteins. Disulfide bonds that form instantaneously in cytoplasm of normal E. coli are reduced by at least 5 proteins, namely, thioredoxins 1 and 2, glutaredoxins 1, 2 and 3 [25] . To keep these proteins in reduced situation, thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase are necessary. Thus, heterologous proteins can fold correctly when the reductase is fully or partly impaired [26] . \n\nAs a host strain with inactivated thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase, E. coli Origami(DE3) is permissive to the formation of disulfide bonds in the more oxidative cytoplasm. It was reported that alkaline phosphatase can partly fold into enzymatically active structure in this mutated host strain [26] . Results listed above show BbFGF, a simple protein with a single disulfide bond and free cysteines, mainly forming into inclusion body in E. coli BL21(DE3), is synthesized as a soluble product in Origami(DE3). In addition, HBscFv, a complex protein with 2 disulfide bonds, exists mainly as an inclusion body and partially as a soluble protein in this oxidized host strain, suggesting that modification of the redox environment of E. coli cytoplasm may significantly improve the solubility of simple proteins which usually for m into inclusion bodies during overproduction. However, it is difficult to obtain a great number of soluble recombinant products for complex proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. \n\nBesides the enhanced solubility, another advantage of E. coli Origami(DE3) that should not be ignored is that recombinant proteins have higher specific bioactivity.",

            "text": "The structural and functional genomics require large supply of soluble, pure and functional proteins for high throughput analysis and as far as screening of soluble or insoluble recombinants is concerned, soluble protein production in E. coli is still a major bottleneck for investigators and a couple of efforts have been reported to improve the solubility or folding of recombinant protein produced in E. coli (Smith 2007). These include strategies like co-expression of chaperone proteins such as GroES, GroEL, DnaK and DnaJ lowering incubation temperature, use of weak promoters, addition of sucrose and betaine in a growth media, use of a richer media with phosphate buffer such as terrific broth (TB), use of signal sequence to export the protein to the periplasmic fraction, fermentation at extreme pH's and use of fusion tags to aid in expression and protein purification (De Marco et al., 2004). A colony filtration (CoFi) blot method for rapid identification of soluble protein expression in E. coli, based on a separation of soluble protein from inclusion bodies by a filtration step at the colony level is described to screen a deletion mutagenesis library by Cornvik et al., (2005) while Coleman et al (2004) report a fluorescent based screening of soluble protein expression where specifically labeled proteins in cellular lysates are detected in one of three formats: a microplate using a fluorescence plate reader, a dot-blot using a fluorescence scanner or a microarray using a laser scanner. Fusion tags have become indispensable tools for structural and functional proteomics initiatives . Fusion tags that are available for the ease of expression and purification of recombinant proteins include His tag (6-10 aa) , thioredoxin (109 aa) (Lavallie et al., 1993), Glutathione S-transferase (236 aa) (Smith & Johnson 1988), maltose binding protein (363 aa) (di Guan et al., 1998), NusA (435 aa) (Davis et al., 1999) etc. Although these tags are mainly used to promote the solubility of the target proteins and there by prevent the formation of inclusion bodies in E.",

            "text": "During the last two decades single chain Fv (scFv) antibodies have become widely applied in research, diagnostics and therapeutic settings [1]. These recombinant, antigen-binding molecules can be engineered [2,3] to modulate their specificity [4] affinity [5] and pharmacokinetics [6] as well as appending novel effector functions [7,8] Established technology allows investigators to produce large and diverse combinatorial scFv libraries commonly using minor coat protein (pIII) filamentous phage display in Escherichia coli (E. coli) [9][10][11][12]. During production of phage-scFvs, the scFv-pIII fusion is translocated to the periplasmic space and remains anchored in the cytosolic membrane by the C-terminal hydrophobic extension of pIII [13]. The fusion protein then assembles with nascent phage particles as they extrude from the inner membrane. \n\nOverall levels of scFv expression, as with all proteins, are dependant on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational level gene regulation. It has been shown that 47% of the variation in E. coli protein abundance is accounted for by mRNA abundance alone and codon-bias and codon adaptation indices account for a major proportion of the remaining variation [14,15]. Expression yield often refers to the level of soluble protein produced in the E. coli which may be located in the periplasm or in culture supernatant. High thermodynamic stability, high molecular weight, increased hydrophobicity and areas of low sequence complexity are linked to poor soluble protein expression yields [16]. Such properties can lead to proteins being more susceptible to proteolytic degradation [17] aggregation and inclusion body formation in either the cytosol [18] or periplasmic space [19,20]. Disulphiderich proteins may also be prone to mis-folding once in the periplasm [21].",

            "text": "Multiple protein expression systems are available for the production of recombinant proteins, e.g., bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, and unicellular algae. However, Escherichia coli is the host system widely used in the production of the rec PrP due to multiple significant benefits over other expression systems including a well-established protein overexpression protocol, low costs, ease of use, and scale (Terpe 2006). A vast number of Escherichia coli strains as well as plasmid vectors with a variety of choices of promoters, affinity tags, and antibiotic resistance are commercially available with the purpose to confer the best results of transformation in the Escherichia coli and an ultimate yield in protein expression. Due to the intrinsic affinity of the PrP C for metals, the additional His-tag sequence is not needed as fusion to PrP to obtain a simple and faster protein purification (Csire et al. 2020;Jackson et al. 2001;Schmitz et al. 2016a). PrP expression in Escherichia coli can be achieved overnight by using autoinduction media or by IPTG protocols (Fig. 1). Commercial or homemade auto-induction media have preferentially been used for the expression of recombinant proteins due to being convenient since the bacterial growth does not need to be measured and due to a higher yield of protein (several-fold higher than conventional IPTG induction systems) (Grabski et al. 2005;Studier 2005). The majority of rec PrP is localized in the inclusion bodies. The isolation of these inclusion bodies can be achieved by a purification protocol for inclusion bodies (Palmer and Wingfield 2004) or with the use of BugBuster Master Mix buffer, which so far is the most effective and fastest method (Fig. 1) (Bourkas et al. 2019). It allows a maximal recovery of functional proteins from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After purification, inclusion bodies are denatured (by guanidine or urea buffer) with the purpose to release the overexpressed proteins in the supernatant.",

            "text": "Slower rates of protein production give newly transcribed recombinant proteins time to fold properly. This was previously addressed when we discussed the role of translational pauses at rare codons and their impact in the production of recombinant proteins. Moreover, the reduction of cellular protein concentration favors proper folding. By far, the most commonly used way to lower protein synthesis is reducing incubation temperature (Schein and Noteborn, 1988;Vasina and Baneyx, 1997;Vera et al., 2007). Low temperatures decrease aggregation, which is favored at higher temperatures due to the temperature dependence of hydrophobic interactions (Baldwin, 1986;Makhatadze and Privalov, 1995;Schellman, 1997).\n\nWhen IB formation is a problem, recombinant protein synthesis should be carried out in the range 15-25 \u2022 C, though one report described successful expression at 4 \u2022 C for 72 h (San-Miguel et al., 2013). However, when working at the lower end of the temperature range, slower growth and reduced synthesis rates can result in lower protein yields. Also, protein folding may be affected as the chaperone network may not be as efficient (McCarty and Walker, 1991;Mendoza et al., 2000;Strocchi et al., 2006). The ArticExpress TM (Stratagene) strain (B line) possesses the coldadapted chaperonin Cpn60 and co-chaperonin Cpn10 from the psychrophilic bacterium Oleispira antarctica (Ferrer et al., 2004). The chaperonins display high refolding activities at temperatures of 4-12 \u2022 C and confer an enhanced ability for E. coli to grow at lower temperatures (Ferrer et al., 2003).",

High level cytoplasmic overexpression may lead to the formation of inclusion bodies (IB). \n\nThese protein aggregates simplify the purification but make in vitro refolding necessary [6,7]. \n\nIn order to make purification easier, protect the target from degradation, (which is especially a problem with low molecular weight molecules [8]) or increase the chance of proper folding, the secretion of the target protein into the periplasm or the culture medium has proven to be a strong alternative [9,10]. Translocation of proteins across the inner membrane requires a signal peptide. However, the presence of a signal sequence alone does not ensure secretion into the periplasmic space [11,12]. Thus, a larger secretion moiety can be linked to the target gene. It has been shown that the Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (SpA) secretion signal combined with miscellaneous Protein A sub-domains directs heterologous proteins into the periplasm or even to the culture supernatant [13]. In addition to promoting protein translocation to the periplasm these domains have been shown to improve folding of the target protein and to protect against N-terminal degradation [14]. \n\nIn the present work we show that domain D of SpA expressed from a synthetic codon optimized gene (sSpAD) is sufficient for the secretion of recombinant proteins. Furthermore we propose the Sec pathway mediating secretion and demonstrate the possibility of a straightforward one step expression and purification system.",

            "text": "This result is similar to that reported by Blackwell and Horgan (35) in which the inclusion of betaine and sorbitol in the growth medium converts a highly expressed Agrobacterium DMAPP:AMP transferase, which normally accumulates as inclusion complexes in E. coli, into an active soluble form. Although the reason for the increased yield of active soluble recombinant protein is unknown, it has been suggested (36) that increasing internal concentrations of compatible osmolytes, such as betaine, which are believed to be excluded from the immediate domains of proteins, causes a thermodynamically unfavorable \"preferential hydration\" and thus minimization of solvent-protein contact and stabilization of protein structure. \n\nProduction of active soluble recombinant GST/QPc fusion protein was found to be IPTG-induction growth time dependent (data not shown). The yield increased as the induction growth time was increased, to a maximum yield which was obtained when cells were harvested three hours after growth induction. When cells were grown for 5 h, there was a 20% decrease in yield, suggesting that the recombinant protein is unstable and susceptible to protease digestion. In summary, the optimal conditions for the production of soluble active recombinant GST/QPc fusion protein are as follows: induction of E. coli JM109/pGEX-QPc cells with IPTG at 27 \u00b0C for three hours on LB medium containing 2.5 mM betaine and 440 mM sorbitol. \n\nOur routine cell extract procedure included treatment with 1% Triton X-100. If this treatment was omitted, the yield of soluble recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein decreased 30%. This suggests that some GST-QPc fusion protein is either in a membrane fraction or an inclusion body aggregate that can be solubilized by Triton X-100 while maintaining the GST-active site recognizable by glutathione agarose gel. Recombinant GST-QPc fusion protein obtained from cell extracts prepared with Triton X-100 has the same molecular size and Q-binding properties as that obtained without Triton X-100 treatment.",

            "text": "Among the systems available for heterologous protein production, Escherichia coli remains the first choice because of its ability to grow rapidly and at high density, its wellcharacterized genetics and the availability of an increasingly large number of vectors and host strains [1][2][3] . With a considerable amount of efforts directed at yield during the past 20 years, heterologous proteins could be produced in E. coli with an amazing productivity. At present, one of the mostly focused fields of E. coli system is how to improve the solubility of heterologous proteins in cytoplasm of this bacterium [3] . This problem might be addressed in two approaches. First, heterologous proteins might be fused with chaperone or refoldase, which promotes the proper isomerization or accelerates rate-limiting steps along the folding pathway [4,5] . Plasmids pET32 [6] and pET44 [7] are the representatives of this kind of vectors. Second, redox environment of E. coli cytoplasm might be altered by genetic engineering, namely, construction of an E. coli mutant with diminished or eliminated reductase system [8] . The effect of this strategy is still not well addressed. To investigate the ISSN 1007-9327 CN 14-1219/ R World J Gastroenterol February 21, 2005 Volume 11 Number 7 influence of redox environment of E. coli cytoplasm on the solubility of heterologous proteins, bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (BbFGF) with a single disulfide bond, and human anti-HBsAg single-chain Fv (HBscFv) with 2 disulfide bonds, selected as model molecules of simple and complex proteins, were produced in normal E. coli strains and in E. coli Origami(DE3), a reductase deficient strain. Comparing the solubility and bioactivity of the recombinant proteins produced in different hosts might help us better understand the folding of heterologous proteins, and be a reference for other proteins' engineering.",

            "text": "Even at low levels, these errors may cause an impact on the tertiary structure, premature termination of protein synthesis or amino acid misincorporation which results in low protein expression (Gustafsson et al., 2004). One strategy to bypass the issue with codon bias is to synthesize the whole human gene based on codon usage in E. coli through site-directed mutagenesis, which is currently a preferred method; however, it is limited by the high cost of production and time consumption (S\u00f8rensen and Mortensen, 2005). An alternative method that is less time consuming utilizes the co-transformation of E. coli strains with a plasmid(s) containing a gene encoding the tRNA cognate to the rare codons (Dieci et al., 2000). Increasing the copy number allows for E. coli to be manipulated to match the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes (Dieci et al., 2000). Currently, there are numerous commercial E. coli strains available that harbor plasmids containing gene sequences encoding the tRNA for rare codons, such as BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL, BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RP and Rosetta (DE3) (Baeshen et al., 2015). Another common problem associated with recombinant protein expression in E. coli involve inclusion body formation, which refers to insoluble and inactive protein aggregates (Hartley and Kane, 1988). E. coli producing recombinant proteins have the ability to assemble in cells and form conglomerates of inclusion bodies as well as result in erroneous protein folding which hinder the extraction of proteins directly from the cell leading to costly purification of proteins (Zweers et al., 2008). Inclusion bodies formed from lack of proportion between protein solubilization and aggregation can be resolved by combining the desired protein with a solubility enhancer fusion partner acting as an intrinsic chaperone in order to ensure the production of soluble recombinant proteins (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014).",

            "text": "Many mammalian proteins can be expressed at high levels in the prokaryotic host E. coli, but frequently accumulate in a misfolded and biologically inactive form in inclusion bodies [1]. Protein solubility can either be enhanced by modifying the production process, or by protein engineering. Most efforts have been directed to chemical denaturation of purified inclusion body proteins followed by refolding procedures. However, this strategy needs to be adapted to a particular protein species, and the yields of soluble protein can vary considerably. Attempts to prevent inclusion body formation and directly increase the solubility of recombinant proteins include expression of the protein of interest fused to a heterologous protein domain as a solubilizing agent [2]. Protein domains employed in this manner comprise glutathione-S-transferase (GST) from Schistosoma japonicum [3], thioredoxin [4], ubiquitin [5], protein A [6], DsbA [7], domain 1 of the translation initiation factor IF2 [8], and the maltosebinding protein (MBP) of E. coli [9,10]. \n\nMBP is part of a large class of proteins that aid in the uptake of small molecules [11]. While it naturally resides in the periplasm, MBP can also be expressed at high yields in the cytoplasm. For different proteins increased solubility, enhanced stability and markedly improved yields have been reported after fusion to MBP [12,13,14,15]. This has been explained by the ability of MBP to act as a chaperone in the context of a fusion protein, and promote the proper folding of the fusion partner [10,16,17]. Here we investigated the potential of MBP to improve as part of a fusion protein the expression of human granzyme B (GrB) as a secreted recombinant protein in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. \n\nThe serine protease GrB is normally released by cytotoxic lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Heterologous recombinant proteins may be formed in a highly soluble biologically active form when their genomes are fused to the E. coli genes with thioredoxin [51]. Few fusions maintain the properties of thioredoxin that are produced by the methods of osmotic shock or freeze/thaw, along with strong thermal stability. Thioredoxin has a low molecular size (11 kDa) and is typically derived in a soluble form at 40% of the total cell protein [52]. Another effective approach for the development of inclusion bodies that comprise heterologous proteins is to lower the growth temperature from 37 to 30 \u2022 C [53,54]. Higher yields are usually obtained in the cytoplasm than in the periplasmic space [55]. It is necessary to export cytoplasmic proteins for the ease of the purification process and promote proper folding. This can be achieved with proteins comprising disulfide bonds since the cytoplasm eliminates an atmosphere to a great extent [56]. The fusion is achieved with a leader peptide at the N-terminal to secrete certain proteins into the periplasm. Osmotic shock or cell wall permeabilization is used to draw the proteins out of the periplasm and into the medium [57]. A mechanism involving regulation with promoter elements (lac, tac, and trc) is employed to increase the output. Promoter structures need to be defined and closely controlled to achieve a low-basal speech quality and must be easily transferable to other E. coli strains that require a simple and inexpensive induction technique, independent of the medium ingredients [58]. \n\nThe secretion of recombinant proteins by E. coli into the periplasm or extracellular medium has several benefits over intracellular development as inclusion bodies. It improves packaging, folding, and in vivo downstream stability and enables the manufacture of soluble active proteins at reduced processing costs [59][60][61][62].",

            "text": "The resulting quantity constituted 5-10% of total E. coli protein. To improve the process in E. coli, the following measures have been used: (i) Use of multiple promoters to control expression; (ii) use of specific host strains; (iii) co-expression of chaperones and/or foldase; (iv) reduction of temperature; (v) secretion of proteins in the periplasmic space or medium; (vi) reduction of protein synthesis; (vii) shift of the growth medium; (viii) introduction of a fusion partner; (ix) release of a protein fragment; and (x) denaturation and refolding of the protein in vitro [45]. Rapid fermentation with a cell density of E. coli has resulted in dry cell contents ranging from 20 to 175 g/L [46]. The issue of acetate development and toxicity can be solved by exponentially feeding glucose in the media and maintaining the real rate of growth below which the development of acetate is obtained. Yields as high as 5.5 g/L of \u03b1-consensus interferon have been achieved in the broth [47]. Long-term development of the chemostat (219 generations below a dilution rate of 0.05 h \u22121 ) produced an E. coli mutant with an increased growth rate and biomass yields, shorter lag period, lower acetate production, and increased stress resistance [48]. This strain produced high yields of heterologous secreted proteins [49]. Heterologous proteins developed as inclusion bodies in E. coli are inert, composite, and insoluble and typically exhibit non-native intraand inter-molecular disulfide bonds and rare free cysteines [50]. Such bodies must be separated from the cell to derive the active protein along with the proteins solubilized by denaturants, and disulfide bonds must be extracted using reduction agents. Refolding is achieved by eliminating the denaturant and reducing agent, accompanied by the protein being renatured. Heterologous recombinant proteins may be formed in a highly soluble biologically active form when their genomes are fused to the E. coli genes with thioredoxin [51].",

            "text": "One important limitation for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli is obtaining large amounts of soluble and functional proteins. Under overexpression conditions, proteins frequently accumulate as insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within producing bacteria. The production of soluble proteins under native conditions is essential for functional and structural analyses. Therefore, many studies have focused on optimising processes in protein expression (see Peti and Page 2007). One possibility is the solubilisation of proteins from inclusion bodies, but it usually requires denaturing conditions, and the subsequent renaturing step can prove difficult. Several experimental approaches have been developed to prevent these aggregates from forming, which include the use of cold inducible expression systems (Qing et al. 2004, Thuy Le andSchumann 2007), to increase the intracellular concentration of molecular chaperones (Mogk et al. 2002), to reduce the IPTG concentration for induction (Winograd et al. 1993), to induce the expression in a late log phase culture (Galloway et al. 2003), and to lower the growth temperature of induced cultures (Schein andNoteborn 1988, Vera et al. 2007).\n\nIn previous works, we reported the isolation and biochemical characterisation of genes P5\u03b2R (Gavidia et al. 2007) and P5\u03b2R2 (P\u00e9rez-Berm\u00fadez et al. 2010), which encode progesterone 5\u03b2-reductase (P5\u03b2R). These enzymes catalyse the 5\u03b2-reduction of progesterone to 5\u03b2pregnan-3,20-dione as the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to cardiac glycosides in Digitalis species. In order to increase active enzyme yield, this study evaluated the effects of different temperatures and induction periods, and of varied initial culture densities, on the recombinant P5\u03b2R2 expression levels.",

            "text": "The large-scale production of recombinant proteins has enabled their exploitation in a wide range of sectors such as biomedicine and biotechnology, for diagnostics, therapy and vaccination [1][2][3][4][5], as well as molecular tools in genetic engineering or catalysts in the biotech industry [3,6]. The production of recombinant proteins, especially at large scale, suffers from important bottlenecks that minimize the yield of functional, usable products [7]. Among them, protein aggregation commonly occurs irrespective of the type of cell factory used for biofabrication [8,9]. In bacteria, in which the recombinant proteins are in general not secreted to the media, aggregation of the recombinant protein results in large cytoplasmic structures called inclusion bodies (IBs) [10]. Soluble aggregates, probably intermediates in IB formation, also abound [11][12][13], since aggregation of recombinant proteins is a complex event that involves a wide spectrum of conformational conformers [14][15][16][17], ranging from properly folded versions to misfolded, amyloidal forms [16]. Globally, the initial step in recombinant protein purification is the separation, after cell lysis, of the soluble cell fraction from the insoluble cell fraction. In this scenario, the populations of recombinant protein that form IBs are retained in the insoluble cell fraction and therefore discarded from the protein purification process, that only involves soluble forms. For aggregation-prone proteins, this fact represents an immediate loss of an important portion of the product that is straightforward excluded from the purification pipeline. \n\nHowever, proteins can also be recovered from IBs once these have been separated from the cell debris. In this regard, several procedures have been described for the recovery of IB protein, based on either denaturing or non-denaturing conditions. In the first, more conventional approach, the IB protein is completely denatured, solubilized, and subjected to a refolding process aiming at recovering the product in the native conformation and with full functionality [18,19].",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are widely-used for the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders. With modern advances in recombinant DNA technology, smaller fragments of these antibodies can be constructed without losing the specificity of their antigen binding [1,2]. Single-chain variable frag-ment (scFv) is formed by the association of the V H and V L domains of the antibody with a short polypeptide linker. The smaller size of these scFv fragments allows better tissue penetration leading to improved tumor-targeting [3] and enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [4]. By far, the most popular system for scFv production is by means of periplasmic expression in Escherichia coli [5]. The periplasm of E. coli provides a more oxidizing environment than the cytosol, which promotes disulphide bond formation, and the periplasmic space also contains fewer host proteins as compared to the cytoplasm, thus facilitating subsequent purification processes. However, when expression of scFv is high, the increased demand for protein folding could generate an uncharacterized metabolic burden on the cells leading to protein misfolding and aggregation [6]. \n\nThe periplasmic localization of several protein folding factors and chaperones catalyze the proper assembly and folding of functional scFv antibody fragments [7,8]. Two established periplasmic protein folding factors in E. coli are Skp and FkpA. Skp is a key periplasmic chaperone for outer membrane protein assembly in E. coli [9] that facilitates proper folding of outer membrane protein intermediates and helps to maintain their solubility [10]. The absence of Skp often leads to protein aggregation in the periplasm, thus reinforcing the importance of Skp as a periplasmic chaperone in E. coli. Co-expression of Skp together with scFv fragments in E. coli periplasm increased scFv solubility and prevented cell lysis during shake flask cultures [11].",

            "text": "Many foreign proteins expressed in bacteria fail to accumulate owing to their improper folding. They are considered as abnormal products by cells and subjected to proteolytic degradation [19]. On the other hand, the misfolded proteins or folding intermediates during overexpression are deposited as insoluble aggregated form in inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies afford protection from proteolytic degradation and favor the production in a larger quantity and rapid isolation from the cells. But they impose the disadvantages of solubilization and tedious refolding process.\n\nProkaryotic Ubl protein ThiS increased heterologous protein expression in E. coli. At mRNA level, it was suggested that the mRNA folding near the ribosomal binding site is more responsible for the variation in protein expression levels [20]. In our experiments, all the fused expression vectors had the same sequence near ribosomal binding site as their respective control vectors. For the stability of mRNA in bacteria, the susceptivity to degradation is more correlated with the sequence at 59 terminus of the mRNA [21]. But when the fused sequence was placed at downstream of the target gene of EGFP, the obviously increased expression was still noticed. Thus enhanced expression by ThiS fusion probably is not attributed to an facilitated transcription or higher stability of mRNA. It may not either be attributed to an efficient translation due to its favorite coden bias because of its bacterial origin, when compared to the coden bias optimized Ub as fusion tag. Enhanced expression of insulin chains was less for half-molecules of ThiS fusion than the whole molecule fusion. That conformed to an enhancing mechanism at protein level, rather than at mRNA level.\n\nAt protein level, fusion tags usually act as solubility enhancers and chaperones or are designed to promote proper folding and to enhance the solubility of the protein of interest [3,22,23], ThiS-tag showed an opposite effect to its eukaryotic counterparts. ThiS did not improve the solubility of insulin A or B chain when fused at their N-termini, and that of EGFP when fused at its C-terminus. EGFP refolded more slowly in vitro when fused with ThiS, and was expressed in relatively less amount of native fluorescent EGFP than the accumulation of non-native EGFP in vivo,",

            "text": "The E. coli prokaryotic system is still the most popular protein expression system because of the well-defined mechanisms and low cost. However, we face some challenges using the E. coli system to express mammalian proteins [10,11,26]. First, high-yield production of mammalian proteins in E. coli often leads to improper protein folding, which results in the insoluble proteins that form inactive aggregates known as inclusion bodies [26]. Second, E. coli lacks the protein post-translational mechanism, so it is only suitable for expression of protein without post-translational modifications (glycerilation, sumolyation, et al.) [10,26]. Third, E. coli does not allow disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm, and all its own proteins containing disulfide bonds are secreted into periplasm and folded there [11,27]. \n\nPrevious studies have shown no post-translational modification in mature FGF15 and FGF19 proteins [23,24], indicating that the bacterial system could be used for expression of both proteins. However, both proteins contain two disulfide bonds, suggesting that they may be expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies due to the lack of ability to form disulfide bond in the reducing environment of E. coli cytoplasm. With the modification of the cytoplasmic reducing environment and co-expression of fusion protein TRX chaperones, soluble FGF19 protein can be expressed in bacterial cytosol, and this result is consistent with a previous finding showing that thioredoxin can improve disulfide bond formation in a reducing background [13]. Interestingly, co-expression of DsbC alone in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm was sufficient to improve FGF19 solubility. Disulfide isomerase (DsbC) is a periplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the isomerization of disulfide bonds. DsbC has been found to function as a chaperone to improve the solubility of disulfide bonds containing proteins in E. coli cytoplasm [28][29][30]. This could also explain why TRX fusion protein in the presence of DsbC would further improve FGF19  solubility.",

Here we propose the use of transverse urea gradient electrophoresis (TUGE) in testing the capability of folding of a recombinant protein from inclusion bodies dissolved in urea. A plasmid encoding the amino acid sequence 55\u2013224 of TcpA pilin (C-terminal globular domain: TcpA-C) from Vibrio cholerae El Tor enlarged by a His-tag on its N-terminus was expressed in E. coli cells. The major fraction (about 90%) of the target polypeptide was detected in cell debris. The polypeptide was isolated from the soluble fraction and recovered from inclusion bodies after their urea treatment. Some structural properties of the polypeptide from each sample proved identical. The refolding protocol was developed on the basis of TUGE data and successfully used for the protein large-scale recovery from inclusion bodies. Spectral, hydrodynamic, and thermodynamic characteristics of the recombinant TcpA recovered from inclusion bodies indicate the presence of a globular conformation with a pronounced secondary structure and a rigid tertiary structure, which is promising for the design of immunodiagnostics preparations aimed to assess the pilin level in different strains of V. cholerae and to develop cholera vaccines.",

            "text": "Other workers have shown that the growth of transformed cells under a decreased growth temperature resulted in an increase in the yield of native, soluble protein [14,15]. It has been reported that cold shock can result in the production of CspA, the major cold-shock protein of E. coli, which is an RNA chaperone, preventing RNA from forming stable secondary structures for efficient translation of mRNAs at low temperature [13,16]. Also a direct consequence of temperature reduction is the partial elimination of heat-shock proteases that are induced under overexpression conditions [17][18][19][20][21][22]. \n\nAlso folding failures of about 60% recombinant proteins produced in E. coli is generally attributed to a limitation in the cell concentration of folding supporter elements, which cannot process the newly synthesized aggregation prone polypeptides. This assumption is physiologically supported by the overexpression of chaperone genes, in particular of chaperone genes from the heatshock protein family, in response to recombinant protein overproduction [23][24][25]. We therefore developed a meth-od that involved induction of expression of recombinant proteins under changing temperature conditions and using rich broth that contain glycerol (4% v/v) with low aeration (see material and methods). Also, before induction, the cultures were cooled to required temperature followed by induction and incubation of cultures at low temperature with slow shaking (10 -40 RPM) to decrease aeration. Andersen and Meyenburg [26] suggest that aerobic growth of E. coli in batch cultures is limited by the rate of respiration and the concomitant rate of ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation [26]. The addition of glycerol (4% v/v) led to a decrease in concentration of nascent polypeptide. We found that expression of 38 recombinant protein MBP or TrxA tagged at 37\u02daC in presence of 4% glycerol resulted in the production of soluble momomeric recombinants protein as shown by native PAGE analysis.",

            "text": "Before initiating a protein expression project, it is essential to determine the definitive use of the recombinantly produced protein. Must the protein be soluble? Does the final product need to be active? Is the native protein conformation important? In some instances, such as antibody production, the production of soluble protein is not necessary, as the protein sequence, rather than the correct 3-dimensional fold, is required for successful antibody production (Yan et al., 2007). For these cases, expression that causes the protein to be incorporated into inclusion bodies is suggested, as the recombinant protein, while misfolded or unfolded, is highly enriched and protected from proteases (Valax and Georgiou, 1993). However, most often, the objective of recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to produce a protein product that is soluble, folded, and active.\n\nExpression in E. coli requires four elements: (1) the protein of interest, (2) a bacterial expression vector, (3) an expression cell line, and (4) the equipment/materials for bacterial cell culture (i.e., shaker/media). There are multiple parameters that can be varied when optimizing an expression protocol, from selecting a vector with the appropriate promoter, to choosing an appropriate induction temperature. With each selection affecting the solubility and activity of the protein product, this task can appear daunting. However, decades of work by individual protein chemists, coupled with the recent experiences of high-throughput structural genomics efforts, have resulted in the identification of a consensus protocol that allows a diverse set of proteins to be successfully expressed in E. coli. A flowchart of the protocol typically used by the authors to express a diverse set of proteins is shown in Figure 5.24.2 (Mustelin et al., 2005;Brown et al., 2008;Critton et al., 2008). More extensive protocols are also available (Peti and Page, 2007;Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a).\n\nThe protocol outlined in Figure 5.24.2 consists of nine steps. First, the optimal residue boundaries of the desired protein product, the \"target protein,\" are determined. The target gene is then subcloned into a bacterial expression vector that utilizes the T7 lacO",

            "text": "The objective of the research was to understand the structural determinants governing protein aggregation into inclusion bodies during expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) and asparaginase were expressed as inclusion bodies in E.coli and the kinetics of aggregate formation was analyzed in details. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were of smaller size (200 nm) and the size of the aggregates did not increase with induction time. In contrast, the seeding and growth behavior of hGH inclusion bodies were found to be sequential, kinetically stable and the aggregate size increased from 200 to 800 nm with induction time. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies showed higher resistance to denaturants and proteinase K degradation in comparison to those of asparaginase inclusion bodies. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were completely solubilized at 2\u20133 M urea concentration and could be refolded into active protein, whereas 7 M urea was required for complete solubilization of hGH inclusion bodies. Both hGH and asparaginase inclusion bodies showed binding with amyloid specific dyes. In spite of its low \u03b2-sheet content, binding with dyes was more prominent in case of hGH inclusion bodies than that of asparaginase. Arrangements of protein molecules present in the surface as well as in the core of inclusion bodies were similar. Hydrophobic interactions between partially folded amphiphillic and hydrophobic alpha-helices were found to be one of the main determinants of hGH inclusion body formation. Aggregation behavior of the protein molecules decides the nature and properties of inclusion bodies.",

            "text": "According to the location of synthesized heterologous proteins in E. coli, they can be classified into different groups. Heterologous proteins can be localized in three different spaces including cytoplasm, periplasm, and extracellular space (secretion into the culture medium) (Fig. 3) (Kleiner-Grote et al. 2018). Accumulation of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm is the most common strategy for recombinant protein production in E. coli, which requires the simplest expression system and demonstrates the highest yield (Makrides 1996). The formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) is one of the bottlenecks in the accumulation of overexpressed recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm (Carri\u00f3 and Villaverde 2001;Ventura and Villaverde 2006). In this case, there is a need to solubilize and refold the aggregated proteins and as a result reduce the yield and bioactivity of the recombinant proteins (Bhatwa et al. 2021). E. coli cytosol has a reducing environment and is not a suitable environment for the expression of recombinant proteins with disulfide bridges. The periplasm of E.coli is a suitable space for proteins that contain disulfide bonds in their structures. These bonds are essential for protein folding and activity (Paraskevopoulou et al. 2022b). Recombinant protein secretion into the periplasm or in the culture medium has many advantages over the intracellular production of recombinant proteins in the form of IBs. It helps in the natural folding and stability of proteins and also helps in the production of active and soluble proteins at a reduced cost (Mergulh\u00e3o et al. 2005). To translocation of the recombinant proteins into the periplasm from the cytosol, various signal peptides have been proposed and utilized (Karyolaimos et al. 2019;Maleki and Hajihassan 2021;Santos et al. 2019). The presence of a small amount of protease and protein in the periplasm as compared to the cytoplasm facilitates the purification of recombinant proteins. One of the most important aspects",

            "text": "However, it is problematic to assemble engineered proteins from genes cloned into the bacteria since it deters protein secretion. Expression of proteins in E. coli cytoplasm produces high yields, but it is challenging due to inconvenient reducing conditions. This condition impairs two intrachain disulfide bonds that determine the antigen-binding activity and proper folding of scFv antibodies. As a result, an expressed product attains the form of inclusion bodies. Hence, additional solubilization protocols by various denaturing agents and further in vitro refolding steps after purification are required. These are tedious, inefficient, time-consuming, and costly [52,53]. \n\nTo moderate these challenges, the gene that facilitates the co-expression of chaperones with the protein of interest is inserted along the scaffold gene segment. By doing so, the protein will gain its correct folding in the reducing environment. Others fuse the target protein to a short signal peptide (i.e., the N-terminal leader peptide). This peptide directs the protein of interest to an oxidizing space called the periplasm. Periplasmic space is presumed to contain essential proteins such as chaperones and disulfide isomerase. These are important for the formation of disulfide bonds that give proper folding to recombinant antibodies. However, the method yields low protein, so if effective folding of antibody fragments is possible, cytoplasmic expression is favored. Yet there is an upsurge of interest by some investigators in gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Bacillus) that lack an outer membrane [54,55]. \n\n(2) Eukaryotic Cell Expression System. For the eukaryotic cell expression system, the most commonly utilized strains in molecular biology are single-celled yeasts from kingdom fungi. These include Pichia pastoris [53] and brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae [56]. They grow faster in culture and offer higher levels of expression than any other alternative expression platforms, such as baculoviruses and mammalian tissue culture. They also share many advantages of eukaryotic cells, including protein processing, protein folding, and posttranslational modifications.",

            "text": "N-)TIMPs in Escherichia coli, even when fused with highly soluble MBP (maltosebinding protein), led to improper or incomplete folding or the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. To obtain their native conformation, the insoluble TIMPs require refolding via manifold denaturation-renaturation steps, i.e. urea solubilization and gradient dialysis. This labor-substantial and time-consuming preparation of TIMPs (usually 3-5 days) significantly impedes studies of TIMPs, especially when TIMP variants are needed [24,25]. Although successful refolding of TIMPs has been reported in literature [8,21,22,[24][25][26][27][28][29], due to the various chemical-physical properties and characteristics of TIMPs, the optimal procedures must be tailored for each TIMP. In addition to deficient yields, other inevitable limitations often include poor reproducibility, heterogeneous oligomeric products, and difficulty of scale-up [22,26].\n\nEncouraged by functional productions of a variety of recombinant human proteins containing multiple disulfide bonds, i.e. T cell receptors, antibodies and tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) [30][31][32], in the oxidative periplasm of E. coli, we hypothesize that periplasmic expression will result in soluble and active TIMPs. In addition to providing an oxidative environment that promotes the formation of disulfide bonds of (N-)TIMPs, periplasmic expression can enhance the correct protein folding due to multiple molecule chaperons (e.g. SurA, PpiA, Ppid, FkpA, and Skp) [33] and a slow processing rate controlled by secretion machineries [34]. Our previous study directly expressed functional MMP-14 catalytic domain (cdMMP-14) in periplasmic space of E. coli [31], and we aim to apply a similar approach for active TIMP production. In this study, by optimizing coexpression of a set of disulfide bond enzymes (Dsb proteins) and selecting",

            "text": "High metabolic burden is also often associated with the accumulation of intracellular proteins as the chaperones become overloaded and inclusion body formation can be observed (Fahnert et al., 2004;Ram\u00f3n et al., 2014). As misfolded intracellular proteins are also known to suffer from long purification times and occasionally low refolding yields (Jungbauer and Kaar, 2007;Singh et al., 2015;Slouka et al., 2018b), the production of soluble extracellular proteins might be a feasible approach. Protein secretion, commonly performed in eukaryotic cells, might also be a key solution to reducing the metabolic burden; however, recombinant protein secretion is not easy to establish in bacteria (Berlec and Strukelj, 2013;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Still, RPP in the periplasm of E. coli has shown to yield promising results, especially when producing antibody fragments, making use of the oxidizing environment (Spadiut et al., 2014a;Kasli et al., 2019). To enable protein secretion in E. coli, engineering of the Sec-Pathway is commonly performed, leading to unfolded protein secretion (Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005;Burdette et al., 2018). Alternatively, the SRP pathway can be used to secrete unfolded hydrophobic amino acid sequences while the twin-arginine pathway can be used to secrete folded proteins to the outer membrane (Berlec and Strukelj, 2013). As the amount of recombinant protein can be as high as 50% of the complete protein content of the cell, the RPP therefore sometimes might be limited by the secretion system itself (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Even though it is challenging to achieve extracellular RPP in E. coli, the company WACKER engineered a secretion system, called ESETEC, which has been upgraded to ESETEC 2 and is able to achieve high extracellular titers (Richter and Koebsch, 2017).",

            "text": "Expression of recombinant Hb in E. coli produces a protein with a reduced cooperativity, loss of most response to allosteric regulation and mulitphasic kinetics. It is clear that reassembly of the tetramer significantly reduces the heterogeneity associated with the recombinant Hb produced in E. coli and tends to restore correct functional behavior including allosteric regulation. The apparent correct functional behavior of the chains suggests that the placement of the subunits in the quaternary structure of the recombinant Hb expressed in E. coli is altered thereby not having full functional behavior. By isolating the subunits, and reassembling the tetramer we have shown that a functional tetrameric Hb is produced. In vivo expression of Hb requires that both \u2423 and \u2424 chains be present (9) suggesting that template assisted folding between the two chains is required for proper folding and assembly of the tetramer. During expression, misassembly could occur due to misalignment of the template. This misassembly, however, does not produce an unstable Hb but rather produces a soluble tetrameric Hb physically similar to but functionally distinct from that of native Hb. This is quite unique among oligomeric proteins which misassemble, since these proteins usually precipitate into inclusion bodies. It has been known that some oligomeric proteins lack the inherent ability to correctly assemble into a protein with biological function. In many cases proteins are expressed as insoluble aggregates in inclusion bodies, solublized in urea, then renatured and reassembled to form an active protein. Molecular chaperons are required, in some instances, to assemble these proteins into the correct structure. For example, plant ferrodoxin-NADP \u03e9 oxidoreductase has recently been expressed in the presence of GroEL and GroES to produce an assembled native peptide, which when expressed in a chaperon-deficient strain of E. coli the protein failed to assemble properly (39).",

            "text": "biotechnological production of protein based therapeutics. Consequently, a large effort has been devoted to the development of orthogonal strategies to increase soluble protein yields, including in vitro protein synthesis (Ventura, 2005). Bacterial extracts have become a convenient means to produce recombinant proteins in vitro, because they contain all the machinery required for protein synthesis. This technology has rendered a significant volume of data on the behavior of proteins during their cell-free synthesis. As illustrated by Tokmakov, these datasets can be exploited to derive the physicochemical and structural properties associated with the solubility and aggregation of eukaryotic proteins (Tokmakov). However, the cell is a very crowded environment and during cell-free experiments the concentration of cellular components is significantly diluted, questioning whether these assays recapitulate intracellular conditions. To address this question, the group of Taguchi has made an effort to synthetize more than 100 proteins in a bacterial cell-free system, either in the absence or in the presence of specific crowding agents. Their results demonstrate that the impact of crowding on aggregation is not generic, but protein-dependent (Niwa et al.). \n \nProtein aggregates are not distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm of bacteria, instead, they are mainly located at one or at the two poles of the organism. This localization has important functional consequences, from regulating signaling to protect the rest of the cell from misfolded species. In an original study, Emberly and co-workers from Simon Fraser University demonstrated that the localization of aggregating proteins in bacteria depends on their expression rates. This suggests that the localization of protein aggregates is constrained by aggregation itself, but also by nucleoid occlusion (Scheu et al.). When the accumulation of these polar aggregates results from the recombinant protein expression, they are named inclusion bodies (IBs). Despite they contain certain impurities, IBs are usually highly enriched in the target polypeptide. This property, together with their insolubility, allows for an easy purification of the recombinant polypeptide. In many cases, the protein can be recovered afterwards in its biologically active form upon in vitro unfolding and subsequent refolding, as demonstrated by",

            "text": "The periplasmic folding process has been suggested to be the major limitation for secretion of recombinant antibodies in E. coli (31,32). Furthermore, replacing residues identified as limiting indeed improved in vitro refolding of reduced and denatured Fv molecules (26), and proline isomerization was rate-limiting for that folding process (33). It is therefore likely that at least some of the substitutions in 5T4 caused an effect that facilitated proper folding. Replacing hydrophobic residues on protein surfaces with more hydrophilic ones has yielded products with suppressed tendencies for aggregation or dimer formation during production (34). Therefore, the variant light chains of 5T4, which are more hydrophilic than the wild-type chain, are probably less prone to aggregate. Preliminary analyses on the amount of light chain dimers indicate that in no case does the level exceed that of Fab (data not shown). Recently, a folding model for recombinant antibodies in E. coli was suggested (33). Here, the light chain acts as a folding template for the heavy chain that would otherwise aggregate. Our data do not contrast that model. Thus, the final yield was probably determined by the folding and aggregate-forming properties of the light chain and the time needed for the heavy chain to find its partner chain before precipitation, which may induce stress to the host cell. \n\nNone of the substitutions in 5T4 resulted in a drastic change in affinity for the antigen. According to the model (Fig. 2 I). \n\nchain framework 1 resulted in a decrease in affinity by approximately 50%, but additional substitutions reversed this effect (Fig. 5 and Table I). Similar to previous experiences (35,36), this shows that particular residues in individual framework regions stabilize the unique conformation of an antibody's antigen binding site. For tumor therapy it is unclear what affinities are optimal, but the repertoire of antibodies generated here, perhaps differing in the k on and k off , may be used to investigate these issues. \n\nThe mechanisms inducing leakage of proteins from periplasm to growth medium are not well known (37,38).",

Recently, ESETEC secretion technology (Wacker Biotech) has been developed to secrete recombinant products into the culture broth during fermentation and resulted in a high yield of Fab (exceeding 4.0 g/l) and of scFv (up to 3.5 g/l) (Gupta and Shukla, 2017b). In another study, it was shown that the optimization of antibody fragment production was accompanied by the alleviation of stress production in the periplasm of E. coli. Thus, the monitoring of stress responses could be used to facilitate enhanced recombinant protein production yields (Baumgarten et al., 2018). Overexpression of membrane protein in E. coli may lead to toxicity and low yields of the active protein product. Snijder and Hakulinen (2016) described the challenges associated with overexpression of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins and different approaches to overcoming these challenges as well as a detailed protocol to express and screen membrane proteins using a His-specific fluorescent probe and fluorescent size-exclusion chromatography. Strategies for the production of soluble recombinant proteins using E. coli were described in another study (Gurramkonda et al., 2018). The latest advances in recombinant protein expression in E. coli were also described recently (Rosano et al., 2019). \n\nCRISPR/Cas9 has been used to successfully carry out the chromosomal integration of large DNA into E. coli and was also able to integrate functional genes in diverse E. coli strains (Chung et al., 2017). In a recent study, it was also reported that CRISPR-Cas9-assisted native end-joining editing offered a simple strategy for efficient genetic engineering in E. coli (Huang et al., 2019). The existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in bacteria were also described in a recent review (Vento et al., 2019).",

On the contrary, many independent studies in the recent decade challenged this wide-accepted opinion and proved the huge potential of IBs. This review focuses on the benefits of tailored-made production of IBs and their emerging use as self-immobilized catalysts used in the synthesis of several industrially interesting products, as well as on their utilization in different areas. \n\nThe quality control system of the cell can deal with partially and poorly folded peptides in both active and passive ways.

Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies. Variable antibody genes have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteines. However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity.",

            "text": "Proteins are vital for virtually all biological processes and recombinant protein production is indispensable for structural and functional characterization as the native expression does not yield sufficient amount of proteins for these studies. Moreover, protein stability and yield are important prerequisites in a wide range of applications including increasing number of therapeutic applications such as monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, cytokines and hormones [1,2]. \n\nExpression of recombinant proteins is hampered due to their poor solubility in heterologous hosts. Intracellular misfolding and poor solubility leads to inclusion bodies formation in bacteria which are submicron size species. [3] Sometimes inclusion bodies based protein expression is deliberate mainly to boost the recombinant protein production [4] or reduce the toxicity of target protein to the host [5]. Some protein-based drugs are also packaged in inclusion bodies [6]. However most of the time recombinantly produced protein are required to be soluble and fully folded. For this purpose, several N-terminal fusion tags like Maltose Binding protein (MBP), trigger factor (TF), Thioredoxin (TRX), transcription termination/antitermination (NusA), Ubiquitin protein (UB), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) have been used to improve the solubility of protein in heterologous prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts [7]. Use of SUMO fusion have been reported to increase protein yield, solubility, and purification in prokaryotes [7,8]. \n\nProtein based pharmaceuticals are one of the innovator pharmaceuticals and promise multibillion dollar industry in the health sector [9]. Protein aggregation, however cause major economic and technical burden on pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as protein based pharmaceuticals products are facing major challenge due to their aggregation over the time, since inherently proteins tend to aggregate [10]. Protein aggregation is a process during which misfolded proteins accumulates into insoluble agglomerates. In order to be functional, proteins should be fully folded. Therefore, if the protein of interest to be used as a therapeutic product, should have long term stability.",

They are of eukaryotic origin and typically require some level of post-translational modification, such as oxidation or glycosylation, and proper disulfide bond formation is essential for protein folding and maturation into their biologically active conformation. Consequently, production of these proteins in bacterial expression systems has been challenging. Strategies to address this issue include refolding GFs expressed in bacteria from inclusion bodies or using mammalian cell culture systems (e.g., CHO, HEK293) for their production (Alexander et al., 1992;Zou and Sun, 2004). Both strategies result in high costs and render SFM cost-prohibitive for use in the production of CCM (Tripathi and Shrivastava, 2019).\n\nEscherichia coli remains a staple of recombinant protein production and when compatible with a target protein, offers advantages in terms of speed, tractability, and cost (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Several advancements in strain engineering have made E. coli an improved host for production of disulfide-containing proteins. Mutation of trxB and gor genes (Bessette et al., 1999), as well as cytoplasmic overexpression of disulfide bond isomerases (e.g., DsbC) (Lobstein et al., 2012) are strategies that have facilitated the expression of disulfide-containing proteins in E. coli, culminating in the development of commercial strains such as Rosetta-gami B (Novagen) and SHuffle T7 (NEB), respectively. In addition, the use of redox fusion partners such as thioredoxin (Trx) (LaVallie et al., 1993), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Schafer et al., 2015), and disulfide bond isomerases (DsbA, DsbC) (Nozach et al., 2013) have greatly improved soluble expression of proteins that contain disulfide bonds in E. coli. Despite these advancements, the use of E. coli to produce soluble mitogenic GFs remains under documented as commercial production still",

According to the invariance of the sequence of the target protein sequence, the obtained COX\u2161 subunit gene was modified, synthesized and then expressed. Different expression vectors (Peasy blunt E1, pET28a, pET30a, pET32a, pET42a) were used to express COX\u2161 fusion protein. However, only pET32a-COX\u2161could be expressed recombinant protein in the E.coli Transetta(DE3) and be detected by the SDS-PAGE and WB. After removal of fusion tag with enterokinase, the monomeric form of COX\u2161 could not be visualized by WB because of the lack of anti-COX\u2161 antibodies. \n\nOverexpression of protein in heterologous systems often results in the formation of inclusion bodies [39]. In the E. coli expression system, the formation of inclusion bodies can be formed owing to the high growth rates of cell lead to the protein unfolded to form the correct conformation [40]. Therefore, improving solubility is a major goal in studying protein production processes. Recently, the use of low growth temperatures to increase soluble protein yields has been reported [41][42]. In present study, most of the COX\u2161 protein expressed in E.coli was as inclusion bodies. Therefore, various strategies have been designed to overcome this drawback. When expressed at 37\u2103, a considerable amount of the total protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was obtained, however only a little soluble protein was detected. Finally, considerable soluble protein was obtained when expressed at 16\u2103, accompanied by a reduced total protein yield. The results suggested that the conformational quality of COX\u2161 protein is significantly influenced by temperature. When grown at low temperature, COX\u2161proteins with the slow rates growth in E. coli cell have enough time to fold in the correct conformation [43]. \n\nAfter removal of fusion tag with enterokinase, UV-visible was used to characterize purified COX\u2161 active site.",

            "text": "A bacterial expression host system, generally E. coli, is the preferable host for recombinant proteins due to its low cost, well-known biochemistry and genetics, rapid growth, and good productivity (Baeshen et al., 2015;Gupta and Shukla, 2016). Some disadvantages of this system include a lack of proper post-translational modifications (PTMs), inclusion body (IB) formation, codon bias, and endotoxin issues. Some techniques such as the addition of fusion tags (Liu M. et al., 2019) to the gene sequence, cofactor supplementation, and co-expression of the protein with molecular or chemical chaperones can avoid IB formation (Gupta S. K. et al., 2019) and improve soluble expression (Malekian et al., 2019). Different tags such as Fh8, SUMO, His, TRX, and MBP at the N-or Cterminal enhance protein solubility and also help in affinity purification (Paraskevopoulou and Falcone, 2018). Inducing protein expression by lowering the temperature after induction of culture leads to soluble protein. This strategy also increases protein stability and proper folding. Further, novel promoters and glycoengineering E. coli cells also lead to increased expression of a recombinant protein (Gupta and Shukla, 2016). However, the production of recombinant proteins in IBs has some advantages such as low product degradation by host cell proteases. Despite the various advantages of this system, a lack of PTM machinery results in a cumbersome purification process (Mamat et al., 2015). PTMs (glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, phosphorylation, or proteolytic processing) are involved in folding processes, stability, and biological activity (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). E. coli has been modified for PTM for the production of recombinant proteins. An E. coli host has also been engineered to produce glycosylated antibodies (Wacker et al., 2002;Valderrama-Rincon et al., 2012;Gupta and Shukla, 2016).",

There are few reports of co-production of molecular chaperones with membrane proteins in E. coli due to the paucity of reports of recombinant membrane protein produced successfully in the host in general. Amongst these, the expression and solubility of the HrcA repressor from Helicobacter pylori were dramatically increased upon induction of heat shock proteins by elevated temperature [109] while overexpression of GroESL led to significantly improved expression of the human liver cytochrome P450 2B6 [110] and a DnaK-DnaJ combination reduced inclusion body formation by the CorA bacterial magnesium transporter [66]. While the present body of literature does not make a particularly compelling case for adding chaperones to membrane protein production experiments in E. coli, screening of their influence in such set-ups is clearly advisable due to the simplicity and low cost of the approach, and their potential benefits on the passage through the cytoplasm and/or periplasm of these often highly hydrophobic and difficult-to-express proteins.",

            "text": "Although all the information necessary for a protein to reach a native structure is contained in its amino acid sequence, in vivo protein folding requires the participation of protein factors; molecular chaperones, folding catalysts and proteases, that monitor or regulate this process through many cellular functions. Under physiological conditions, these factors maintain quality control of protein biosynthesis, and errors or failures of the protein folding process are rare. However, incorrectly folded or misfolded proteins can appear as a result of (i) spontaneous or inducible mutations that affect protein folding pathways, (ii) exposure of the cell to environmental stress, such as elevated temperatures or hyperosmolarity, and (iii) overexpression of recombinant genes. In these cases, the polypeptide chain, instead of folding into the native biologically active state, misfolds, and eventually induces a stress response [1]. The resulting misfolded proteins may either be degraded by proteases, repaired by chaperones, or aggregated and sequestered as inclusion bodies (IBs), when escaping protein folding quality control [2].\n\nIn the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, this control is performed mainly by a set of stress-inducible chaperones and proteases collectively known as heat shock proteins (Hsps). The presence of cellular membrane-bounded compartments in E. coli further complicates these issues of protein biosynthesis, and implies the existence of distinct folding and degradation machineries, quality control systems, for extracytoplasmic proteins [3]. The bacterial periplasm is separated from the extracellular milieu only by the porous outer membrane, and hence is more susceptible to changes in the environment than the cytoplasm. Thus, protein quality control in the periplasm is crucial for the survival of bacterial cells. Here we summarize the main features of protein folding in the periplasm of E. coli, and focus on studies using a model system, the maltosebinding protein.",

The DE3 lysogenic host has one copy of T7 RNA polymerase gene (Gene1), which was pre-integrated into genome to produce a very limited amount of T7 RNA Polymerase [17]. The pET expression system from Novagen Inc. was one representative of such approach and has been widely used for protein expression in E. coli [18]. Although the amount of T7 RNA polymerase was very limited, the speed of target gene transcription was still too fast. The high-level expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often accumulate as insoluble aggregate in vivo as the inclusion body [19] that severely limit its application. \n\nWe proposed that the inclusion body formation was due to the high efficiency of T7 RNA polymerase. The inclusion body is very likely to form due to the imbalance between the speed of target gene transcription and protein folding. In this study, we developed a series of asRNAs with different inhibition efficiency to fine turn Gene1 expression, which dramatically decreased the inclusion body formation of T7 expression system.",

            "text": "The production of disulfide bond-containing recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli has traditionally been done by either refolding from inclusion bodies or by targeting the protein to the periplasm. However, both approaches have limitations. Two broad strategies were developed to allow the production of proteins with disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm of E. coli: i) engineered strains with deletions in the disulfide reduction pathways, e.g. SHuffle, and ii) the co-expression of oxidative folding catalysts, e.g. CyDisCo. However, to our knowledge, the relative effectiveness of these strategies has not been properly evaluated. Here, we systematically compare the purified yields of 14 different proteins of interest (POI) that contain disulfide bonds in their native state when expressed in both systems. We also compared the effects of different background strains, commonly used promoters, and two media types: defined and rich autoinduction. In rich autoinduction media, POI which can be produced in a soluble (non-native) state without a system for disulfide bond formation were produced in higher purified yields from SHuffle, whereas all other proteins were produced in higher purified yields using CyDisCo. In chemically defined media, purified yields were at least 10x higher in all cases using CyDisCo. In addition, the quality of the three POI tested was superior when produced using CyDisCo.",

            "text": "BackgroundThe most efficient method for enhancing solubility of recombinant proteins appears to use the fusion expression partners. Although commercial fusion partners including maltose binding protein and glutathione-S-transferase have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility, they cannot be used for the proprietory production of commercially value-added proteins and likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. Thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining presented in this study.ResultsWe analyzed the Escherichia coli proteome response to the exogenous stress of guanidine hydrochloride using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and found that RpoS (RNA polymerase sigma factor) was significantly stress responsive. While under the stress condition the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 7 %, but a 6-fold increase in the level of RpoS was observed, indicating that RpoS is a stress-induced protein. As an N-terminus fusion expression partner, RpoS increased significantly the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm, indicating that RpoS is a very effective solubility enhancer for the synthesis of many recombinant proteins. RpoS was also well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of Pseudomonas putida cutinase.ConclusionRpoS is highly effective as a strong solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins when it is used as a fusion expression partner in an E. coli expression system. The results of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase.",

            "text": "Under the regulation of strong promoters, as in numerous commercial plasmid-based vectors, heterologous proteins are typically expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. The overexpression of plasmid-encoded genes can trigger transcription of heat-shock genes and other stress responses and often result in the aggregation of the encoded proteins as inclusion bodies [1]. The formation of inclusion bodies offers distinct advantages for the separation of overexpressed protein, because the aggregates that mostly contain the product in a high concentration can be easily isolated [2]. However, the recombinant proteins found in inclusion bodies are often in a misfolded state, methods that can be used to avoid aggregation to yield a soluble and active product are sometime very desirable. To improve the expression of soluble recombinant proteins, introducing a fusion partner (tag) such as N-utilization substance A (NusA), maltose-binding protein (MBP), thioredoxin (TRX), or glutathione S-transferase (GST), to the recombinant protein is one of the most commonly used methods to increase solubility [3,4]. We previously constructed two double-tagged gene fusions for overexpressing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (GlcNAc 2-epimerase) and N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid aldolase (Neu5Ac aldolase), two sequential enzymes in the production of sialic acids. Both proteins were tagged with GST at the N-terminus, but at the C-terminus, one was tagged with five contiguous aspartate residues (5D) and the other with five contiguous arginine residues (5R) [5]. The fusions were so designed to yield fusion proteins having charged surfaces at working pH, which allowed isolation and immobilization in a single step with either an anionic or a cationic exchanger that electrostatically bound fusion proteins via the 5D or 5R tag. In contrast to overexpressed GST alone that was totally soluble, however, most of overexpressed fusion proteins were in insoluble fraction.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most important production system for recombinant proteins reaching volumetric yields in the gram per liter scale for extracellular production (40)(41)(42). For production of functional antibody fragments, the key to success was the secretion of both V chains into the periplasmic space of E. coli where the oxidizing environment allows the correct formation of disulfide bonds and the assembly to a functional Fv fragment (43). This strategy also allowed the first expression of functional Fab fragments in E. coli described in 1988 (44). \n\nThe production of recombinant antibodies in the reducing cytoplasmic compartment results mostly in non-functional aggregates (45). Recovery of functional antibody fragments from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by complete denaturation and refolding (46) is often not efficient. Stable cysteine free mutants of some scFvs were successfully produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli (47,48). E. coli strains with mutations in the glutathione and thioredoxin reductase in combination with coexpression of cytoplasmic chaperones GroEL/ES, trigger factor, DnaK/J as well as signal sequence-less variants of periplasmic chaperones DsbC and Skp increased the yield of functional Fab (49). \n\nFor the production of camelid single domain antibodies (VHH), coexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase increased the yield in the cytoplasm (50). \n\nDespite these efforts, most antibody fragments are produced in the periplasm of E. coli using N-terminal leader sequences targeting the periplasmic Sec pathway (51), for example signal peptides derived from outer membrane protein A (OmpA), alkaline phosphatase A (PhoA), or pectate lyase B (PelB) (52)(53)(54). Also the SRP pathway can be used for antibody fragment production (55).",

It has been established that in vivo protein folding is an energy dependent process mediated by two classes folding modulators; molecular chaperones-DnaK-Dn-aJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES systems, which suppress offpathway aggregation reaction and lead to the proper folding through ATP-coordinated cycle of binding and release of intermediates [78]. Additionally, it accelerates rate-limiting steps along the protein folding pathway such as cis-trans isomerization of peptide-prolyl bonds and formation/reshuffling of disulfide-bridges [79,80]. These two chaperone system holds great promise in facilitating the production, purification and proper folding of heterologous protein [81,82]. \n\nMolecular chaperone has three sub-classes based on their mechanism of actions [83]. \"Folding\" chaperones (e.g., DnaK and GroEL) as mentioned above, \"Holding\" chaperones (e.g. IbpB) maintain partially folded proteins on their surface to await availability of folding chaperones upon stress slack and the \"Disaggregating\" chaperone ClpB promotes the solubilization of the protein that became aggregated as a result of stress. The general mechanism of protein folding assisted by molecular chaperones is depicted in Figure 2 [84]. In Figure 2, A represents m-RNA which translates into unfolded-protein (U). In absence of any chaperone protein, U can fold back to its native form (N) along with the aggregationprocess which leads to inclusion-bodies (Z); but in presence of chaperone protein U solely folds back to its native form (N) via an intermediate (I) with chaperone protein without any aggregation path which leads to inclusion bodies. The path from I to N governs by the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi.",

            "text": "Aggregation of cysteine-rich proteins usually results in inclusion body formation as the reduced state in the cytoplasm makes forming the disulfide bonds difficult (which enable proper folding). A variety of methods have been reported to tackle these issues, for instance, optimizing culture and purification conditions (Kiedzierska et al., 2008), recovering and re-folding active proteins from inclusion bodies (Singh et al., 2015), expression in the periplasm, and many others (Ban et al., 2020). In addition to this array of strategies, in this study we have coupled two, somewhat disjoint methodologies, but when combined lead to significantly increased yields of soluble protein. \n\nFirst, we sought to reduce inclusion body formation with an autoinduction method mediated by rewiring the genetic circuitry of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) so that instead of mediating endogenous QS functions like biofilm formation, we engineered cells to induce expression of genes-of-interest. Overexpression of a recombinant protein is often accompanied by an imbalance of metabolism, often referred to as a \"metabolic burden\" (Bentley et al., 1990). In addition, the induction process is typically initiated by the addition of a bolus of inducer, which, in turn, can bring about significant transients in precursors or energy levels (Harcum and Bentley, 1993;Ramirez and Bentley, 1995;DeLisa et al., 2001a). This imposed stress could exhaust the bacterium's innate protein folding and quality control machinery, leading to improperly folded proteins that aggregate and form inclusion bodies or get targeted for degradation. By rewiring the native quorum sensing system of E. coli, we had previously developed an autonomous induction system that used QS autoinducer signals (i.e., autoinducer 2, AI-2) to guide high level expression of recombinant proteins (Tsao et al., 2010). \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, E. coli naturally secrete AI-2 that accumulates in the culture fluids as the cells grow in number.",

            "text": "Usually in vitro oxidative refolding is difficult, laborious, time consuming and may be uneconomical depending upon refolding yield (Lilie et al. 1998;Lange and Rudolph 2009;Yamaguchi et al. 2013;Basu et al. 2011). Translocation of these proteins into the E. coli periplasm provides favorable environment for oxidative folding due to the presence of disulfide bond folding and isomerization machinery (Gopal and Kumar 2013;Yoon et al. 2010;Choi and Lee 2004). Moreover, proteases are less abundant in periplasm and also its relatively less crowded than cytosol which reduces the chances of proteolysis and ease in the purification of recombinant proteins (Makrides 1996). To secrete proteins into periplasmic space, a translocation signal sequence must be fused at the N terminus of proteins, but only the fusion of signal sequence is not enough for efficient protein translocation (Fekkes and Driessen 1999;Muller et al. 2001). The sequences on mature protein next to the signal peptidase cut site and other parts of mature protein play an important role in the secretion (Lee et al. 1989;Malik et al. 2006). Under such condition, fusion to a full-length periplasmic protein that is well stable, soluble and properly folded is more promising (Table 1). \n\nOver two decades of extensive in vivo and in vitro research on protein fusions constructs concluded that fusion tags usually increases the yield and solubility of their fusion partners (Costa et al. 2014;Waugh 2005). Despite all these advancement, still it is difficult to choose the best fusion system for a given protein of interest. In general, selection of fusion tag depends upon the properties of protein of interest itself such as size, stability, and hydrophobicity; the expression site; and the usage of the recombinant protein. After coupling with second protein (fusion tag) the increase in yield and solubility the target proteins varies in each fusions. The detailed mechanism by which fusion proteins improve solubility and yield is not well understood.",

            "text": "Insoluble recombinant proteins are a major issue for both structural genomics and enzymology research. Greater than 30% of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) appear to be insoluble. The prevailing view is that insolubly expressed proteins cannot be easily solubilized, and are usually sequestered into inclusion bodies. However, we hypothesize that small molecules added during the cell lysis stage can yield soluble protein from insoluble protein previously screened without additives or ligands. We present a novel screening method that utilized 144 additive conditions to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. These selected additives are natural ligands, detergents, salts, buffers, and chemicals that have been shown to increase the stability of proteins in vivo. We present the methods used for this additive solubility screen and detailed results for 41 potential drug target recombinant proteins from infectious organisms. Increased solubility was observed for 80% of the recombinant proteins during the primary and secondary screening of lysis with the additives; that is 33 of 41 target proteins had increased solubility compared with no additive controls. Eleven additives (trehalose, glycine betaine, mannitol, L-Arginine, potassium citrate, CuCl2, proline, xylitol, NDSB 201, CTAB and K2PO4) solubilized more than one of the 41 proteins; these additives can be easily screened to increase protein solubility. Large-scale purifications were attempted for 15 of the proteins using the additives identified and eight (40%) were prepared for crystallization trials during the first purification attempt. Thus, this protocol allowed us to recover about a third of seemingly insoluble proteins for crystallography and structure determination. If recombinant proteins are required in smaller quantities or less purity, the final success rate may be even higher.",

Recently, we developed the CASPON^TM technology, a generic fusion tag-based platform process for high-titer soluble expression including a standardized downstream processing and highly specific enzymatic cleavage of the fusion tag. To assess potential strategies for further improvement of the N-terminally fused CASPON^TM tag, we modified the 5\u2019UTR and 5\u2019 region of the tag-coding mRNA to optimize the ribosome-mRNA interactions. Results In the present work, we found that by modifying the 5\u2019UTR sequence of a pET30a cer plasmid-based system, expression of the fusion protein CASPON^TM-tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 was altered in laboratory-scale carbon-limited fed-batch cultivations, but no significant increase in expression titre was achieved. Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total.

Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility.

Besides the translocation of cargo proteins, the signal peptides (SPs) of some secretory proteins, such as the ssTorA and Iasp, have been used as an inclusion body tag (IB-tag) or the recombinant expression enhancer in the cytosol of E. coli. In this study, the approach to utilize the SP of Vip3A (Vasp) from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) as a fusion tag was investigated. The results showed that either the Vasp or its predicted N- (VN), H- (VH), and C-regions (VC), as well as their combinations (VNH, VNC, and VHC), were able to significantly enhance the production yield of eGFP. However, the hydrophobic region of the Vasp (VH and/or VC) made more than half of the eGFP molecules aggregated (VeGFP, VHeGFP, VCeGFP, VNHeGFP, VNCeGFP, and VHCeGFP). Interestingly, the addition of the Bt trigger factor (BtTF) led to the neutralization of the negative impact and solubilization of the fusion proteins. Therefore, the coexpression of Vasp or its derivates with the chaperone BtTF could be a novel dual-enhancement system for the production yield and solubility of recombinant proteins. Notably, EcTF was unable to impact the solubility of Vasp or its derivates guided proteins, suggesting its different specificities on the recognition or interaction. Additionally, this study also suggested that the translocation of Vip3 in the host cell would be regulated by the BtTF-involved model.",

Since the yield of recombinant TAT-Cre is limited by formation of inclusion bodies, we hypothesized that the positively charged arginine-rich TAT sequence causes the inclusion body formation, whereas its neutralization by the addition of a negatively charged sequence improves solubility of the protein. To prove this, we neutralized the positively charged TAT sequence by proximally attaching a negatively charged poly-glutamate (E12) sequence.

Furthermore, the growth of cells expressing E12-TAT-Cre was increased compared with that of the cells expressing TAT-Cre. Efficacy of the purified TATCre was confirmed by a recombination test on a floxed plasmid in a cell-free system and 293 FT cells. Taken together, our results suggest that attachment of the E12 sequence to TAT-Cre improves its solubility during expression in E. coli (possibly by neutralizing the ionic-charge effects of the TAT sequence) and consequently increases the yield.

            "abstract": "Modulating resource allocation in bacteria to redirect metabolic building blocks to the formation of recombinant proteins rather than biomass formation remains a grand challenge in biotechnology. Here, we present a novel approach for improved recombinant protein production (RPP) using Escherichia coli (E. coli) by decoupling recombinant protein synthesis from cell growth. We show that cell division and host mRNA transcription can be successfully inhibited by co-expression of a bacteriophage-derived E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibitor peptide and that genes over-transcribed by the orthogonal T7 RNAP can finally account to > 55 % of cell dry mass (CDM). This RNAP inhibitor peptide binds the E. coli RNAP and therefore prevents \u03c3-factor 70 mediated formation of transcriptional qualified open promoter complexes. Thereby, the transcription of \u03c3-factor 70 driven host genes is inhibited, and metabolic resources can be exclusively utilized for synthesis of the protein of interest (POI).

            "text": "Modulating resource allocation in bacteria to redirect metabolic building blocks to the formation of recombinant proteins rather than biomass formation remains a grand challenge in biotechnology. Here, we present a novel approach for improved recombinant protein production (RPP) using Escherichia coli (E. coli) by decoupling recombinant protein synthesis from cell growth. We show that cell division and host mRNA transcription can be successfully inhibited by co-expression of a bacteriophage-derived E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibitor peptide and that genes over-transcribed by the orthogonal T7 RNAP can finally account to > 55 % of cell dry mass (CDM).

Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs (Kuczyn\u0301ska-Wis\u0301nik et al., 2004)(Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2006)[6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product (Hrab\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al., 2015).",

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful.

In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology.",

IbpA/B are induced during overproduction of recombinant proteins and bind to inclusion bodies in E. coli cells. We investigated the effect of DeltaibpA/B mutation on formation of inclusion bodies and biological activity of enzymes sequestered in the aggregates in E. coli cells. Using three different recombinant proteins: Cro-beta-galactosidase, beta-lactamase and rat rHtrA1 we demonstrated that deletion of the ibpA/B operon did not affect the level of produced inclusion bodies. However, in aggregates containing IbpA/B a higher enzymatic activity was detected than in the IbpA/B-deficient inclusion bodies. These results confirm that IbpA/B protect misfolded proteins from inactivation in vivo.",
                    "[16458702 | Rosano et al. | 2014 | Citations: 74]": "The emergence of recombinant DNA technology during the early 70's set a revolution in molecular biology. This set of techniques was strengthened even further later on with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction and allowed scientists to explore and understand essential life processes in an easy and straightforward way. It also marked the birth of the modern biotech industry. At that time, it was shown that eukaryotic DNA could be propagated in Escherichia coli (Morrow et al., 1974) and functional products could be synthesized from heterologous genes cloned in bacterial plasmids (Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977; Vapnek et al., 1977). After these successful cases, it was soon realized that the potential applications of these techniques were almost limitless. In fact, US patent 4,237,224 granted to Cohen and Boyer (1980) claimed to commercial ownership of the methodology for cloning virtually all possible DNAs in all possible vectors. While cloning any gene in any given vector is feasible, obtaining a functional product from its expression is not that simple. \n \nIn this series of articles, the authors describe the methods and technologies available for producing recombinant proteins in different microbes. They also introduce and discuss recent advances that attempt to tackle common pitfalls in the process. Taken together, this E-book will be of great importance for those entering the field as well as for experienced researchers that are looking for an update in the state of the art. \n \nBefore proceeding any further, it is necessary to clarify an important aspect of this topic. In biology, the universal accepted definition of \u201cexpression\u201d is \u201cproduction of an observable phenotype by a gene\u2014usually by directing the synthesis of a protein\u201d (Alberts et al., 2002). By this definition, the term \u201cgene expression\u201d is correct while \u201cprotein expression\u201d is basically lab jargon. We do think that correct usage of scientific language is of great importance, yet in this particular case, the usage of \u201cprotein expression\u201d in the scientific community is so pervasive that readers will immediately understand what we are talking about. So, considering that \u201cprotein expression\u201d found its way into journal names, book names and high-impact reviews (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005) and research papers (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) (>1800 citations in Scopus) we and other authors have used it interchangeably with more correct terms like protein production or protein synthesis."

Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs (Kuczyn\u0301ska-Wis\u0301nik et al., 2004)(Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2006)[6].

                "snippets": "Escherichia coli retains its dominant position as the first choice of host for the high-throughput production of proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest because of rapid biomass accumulation, well-established genetic manipulation methods and simple process scale-up (Baneyx, 1999)(Swartz, 2001). However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides (Kane et al., 1991). Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding (Langenhof et al., 2005). Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers (Clark et al., 1998)(Kiefhaber et al., 1990). Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization can dominate the rate and pathway of protein folding and in turn determine the refolding efficiency [7](Tan et al., 1997).",

We use ribonuclease T1 as a model protein, because it is a small single-domain protein with a well-defined secondary and tertiary structure, which is stable in the presence and absence of disulfide bonds. Also, an efficient mutagenesis system is available to produce protein molecules with defined sequence variations. Here we present a preliminary characterization of the folding kinetics of ribonuclease T1. Its unfolding and refolding reactions are reversible, which is shown by the quantitative recovery of the catalytic activity after an unfolding/refolding cycle. Refolding is a complex process, where native protein is formed on three distinguishable pathways. There are 3.5% fast-folding molecules, which refold within the millisecond time range, and 96.5% slow-folding species, which regain the native state in the time range of minutes to hours. These slow-folding molecules give rise to two major, parallel refolding reactions. The mixture of fast- and slow-folding molecules is produced slowly after unfolding by chain equilibration reactions that show properties of proline isomerization. We conclude that part of the kinetic complexity of RNase T1 folding can be explained on the basis of the proline model for protein folding. This is supported by the finding that the slow refolding reactions of this protein are accelerated in the presence of the enzyme prolyl isomerase. However, several properties of ribonuclease T1 refolding, such as the dependence of the relative amplitudes on the probes, used to follow folding, are not readily explained by a simple proline model.",

The isomerisation of one or more of these peptidyl-proline bonds to the cis conformation in the denatured state gives rise to heterogeneity, leading to both fast and slow-folding species. The refolding of the fast-folding species, which has all trans peptidyl-proline bonds, is much faster than that of the slow-folding species, which have one or more cis peptidyl-proline bonds. In CI2, the slow-folding species can be classified into two groups by their rates of refolding, temperature-dependence, pH-dependence and [GdmCl]-dependence of the rate constants and the effect of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase on the rate constants. The replacement of Pro6 by Ala removes one of the slow refolding phases, suggesting that the cis peptidyl-Pro6 conformation is solely responsible for one of the slow-folding species. Pro6 is located in a region of the protein where non-random interactions have been found in a series of N-terminal fragments of CI2 (residues 1 to 13, 1 to 25, 1 to 28 and 1 to 40). In addition, NMR studies on a mutant fragment, (1-40)T3A, have confirmed that this non-native interaction is associated with the bulky side-chain of Trp5. The atypical rate of cis to trans isomerisation of the peptidyl-Pro bond is indicative of the presence of a similar hydrophobic cluster in the physiological denatured state of intact CI2."

However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides (Kane et al., 1991). Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration.

Refolding of inclusion body proteins into bioactive forms is cumbersome, results in poor recovery and accounts for the major cost in production of recombinant proteins from E. coli. With new information available on the structure and function of protein aggregates in bacterial inclusion bodies, it has been possible to develop improved solubilization and refolding procedures for higher recovery of bioactive protein. Inclusion bodies are formed from partially folded protein intermediates and are composed of aggregates of mostly single types of polypeptide. This helps to isolate and purify the protein aggregates to homogeneity before solubilization and refolding. Proteins inside inclusion body aggregates have native-like secondary structures. It is assumed that restoration of this native-like secondary structure using mild solubilization conditions will help in improved recovery of bioactive protein in comparison to solubilization using a high concentration of chaotropic agent. Analysis of the dominant forces causing aggregation during inclusion body formation provides information to develop suitable mild solubilization procedures for inclusion body proteins. Refolding from such solubilized protein will be very high due to restoration of native-like secondary structure. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies were purified to homogeneity from E. coli cells before solubilization and refolding. Pure inclusion bodies were solubilized at alkaline pH in the presence of 2 M urea solution. The solubilized proteins were refolded using a pulsatile renaturation process and subsequently purified using chromatographic procedures. More than 40% of the inclusion body proteins could be refolded back to the bioactive native conformation. Mild solubilization is thus the key for high recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies."

In the overexpression system, the rate of protein aggregation is often much greater than that of proper folding and chaperone proteins are rapidly used up [4]. These protein aggregates are called inclusion bodies. As the target proteins are usually purified from soluble fractions in bacteria cell lysates, the formation of inclusion bodies is often a drawback in the use of E. coli expression systems [2]. Changing the growth conditions, such as growth temperature, concentration of inducer, and induction time, can often help in decreasing the formation of inclusion bodies (insoluble fraction of the proteins)."

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

Based on an amyloidal skeleton combined with varying amounts of native or native-like protein forms, bacterial inclusion bodies exhibit an unusual arrangement that confers mechanical stability, biological activity and conditional protein release, being thus exploitable as versatile biomaterials. The applicability of inclusion bodies in biotechnology as enriched sources of protein and reusable catalysts, and in biomedicine as biocompatible topographies, nanopills or mimetics of endocrine secretory granules has been largely validated. Beyond these uses, the dissection of how recombinant bacteria manage the aggregation of functional protein species into structures of highly variable complexity offers insights about unsuspected connections between protein quality (conformational status compatible with functionality) and cell physiology."

Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) and asparaginase were expressed as inclusion bodies in E.coli and the kinetics of aggregate formation was analyzed in details. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were of smaller size (200 nm) and the size of the aggregates did not increase with induction time. In contrast, the seeding and growth behavior of hGH inclusion bodies were found to be sequential, kinetically stable and the aggregate size increased from 200 to 800 nm with induction time. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies showed higher resistance to denaturants and proteinase K degradation in comparison to those of asparaginase inclusion bodies. Asparaginase inclusion bodies were completely solubilized at 2\u20133 M urea concentration and could be refolded into active protein, whereas 7 M urea was required for complete solubilization of hGH inclusion bodies. Both hGH and asparaginase inclusion bodies showed binding with amyloid specific dyes. In spite of its low \u03b2-sheet content, binding with dyes was more prominent in case of hGH inclusion bodies than that of asparaginase. Arrangements of protein molecules present in the surface as well as in the core of inclusion bodies were similar. Hydrophobic interactions between partially folded amphiphillic and hydrophobic alpha-helices were found to be one of the main determinants of hGH inclusion body formation. Aggregation behavior of the protein molecules decides the nature and properties of inclusion bodies."

Mild solubilization methods have been discussed which are based on the understanding of the fact that protein molecules in inclusion body aggregates have native-like structure. These methods solubilize the inclusion body aggregates while preserving the native-like protein structure. Subsequent protein refolding and purification results in high recovery of bioactive protein.

However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity."

                "snippets": "Multiple factors influence the formation of these inclusion bodies, including misfolding of proteins, low levels of chaperones, which impede proper protein conformation under reduced cytoplasmic conditions, and susceptibility to degradation by proteases [14]. To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19].\n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24].",

The most remarkable property of the GroE system is the ability to fold proteins under conditions where spontaneous folding cannot occur. To achieve this, a fully functional system consisting of GroEL, the cochaperone GroES, and ATP is necessary. Driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis, this system cycles through different conformational stages, which allow binding, folding, and release of substrate proteins. Some aspects of the ATP-driven reaction cycle are still under debate. One of these open questions is the importance of so-called \"football\" complexes consisting of GroEL and two bound GroES rings. Here, we summarize the evidence for the functional relevance of these complexes and their involvement in the efficient folding of substrate proteins.",

The expression products were characterized by using Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The results of the co-expression of chaperone showed that the number of soluble fraction was higher than the one without co-expression of chaperone.

To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19].\n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24]."

Structural stability of proteins is of crucial importance for efficient presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC, which plays a decisive role for triggering strong immune reactions. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss structural stability as a key factor for modulating the potency of recombinant vaccines and its importance for antigen proteolysis, presentation, and stimulation of B and T cells. Moreover, the impact of fold stability on downstream events determining the differentiation of T cells into effector cells is reviewed. We summarize studies investigating the impact of protein fold stability on the outcome of the immune response and provide an overview on computational methods to estimate the effects of point mutations on protein stability. Expert commentary: Based on this information, the rational design of up-to-date vaccines is discussed. A model for predicting immunogenicity of proteins based on their conformational stability at different pH values is proposed."

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein.",

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein.",

Escherichia coli is one of the best known and most often used host organisms for economical protein production. However, upon over-expression, protein aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs) are often formed. Until recently IBs formation represented a bottleneck in protein production as they were considered as deposits of inactive proteins. However, recent studies show that by choosing the appropriate host strain and designing an optimal production process, IBs composed from properly folded and biologically active recombinant proteins can be prepared. Such active protein particles can be further used for the isolation of pure proteins or as whole active protein particles in various biomedical and other applications. Therefore interest in understanding the mechanisms of their formation as well as their properties is increasing."

Several approaches have been described for in vitro refolding; most of them involve the use of additives for assisting correct folding.

Most proteins, especially those with multiple disulfide bonds, have been shown to form insoluble protein or inclusion body in E. coli. An inactive form of protein would require an in vitro refolding step to regain biological functions. In this study, we described the system for soluble expression of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep27scFv) by coexpressing Dsb protein and enhancing with medium additives. The results revealed that overexpression of DsbABCD protein showed marked effect on the soluble production of Hep27scFv, presumably facilitating correct folding. The optimal condition for soluble scFv expression could be obtained by adding 0.5M sorbitol to the culture medium. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that soluble scFv expressed by our method retains binding activity toward the same epitope on a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HCC-S102) recognized by intact antibody (Ab) (Hep27 Mab). Here, we report an effective method for soluble expression of scFv in E. coli by the Dsb coexpression system with the addition of sorbitol medium additive.

Even though thermo-inducible systems were developed in the late 1970's, the number of studies that focus on strategies for the implementation at bioreactor scale is limited. In this work, the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter is once again investigated as an inducible element but for the production of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Culture temperature, induction point, induction duration and number of inductions were considered as factors to maximize GFP production in a 20-L bioreactor.ResultsIt was found that cultures carried out at 37\u00b0C resulted in a growth-associated production of GFP without the need of an induction at 42\u00b0C. Specific production was similar to what was achieved when separating the growth and production phases. Shake flask cultures were used to screen for desirable operating conditions. It was found that multiple inductions increased the production of GFP. Induction decreased the growth rate and substrate yield coefficients; therefore, two time domains (before and after induction) having different kinetic parameters were created to fit a model to the data collected.ConclusionBased on two batch runs and the simulation of culture dynamics, a pre-defined feeding and induction strategy was developed to increase the volumetric yield of a temperature regulated expression system and was successfully implemented in a 20-L bioreactor. An overall cell density of 5.95 g DW l-1 was achieved without detriment to the cell specific production of GFP; however, the production of GFP was underestimated in the simulations due to a significant contribution of non-growth associated product formation under limiting nutrient conditions."

A sucrose step gradient succeeded in separating aggregate subclasses of a GFP-GST fusion protein with specific biochemical and biophysical features, providing a novel approach for studying recombinant protein aggregates.ResultsThe total lysate separated into 4 different fractions whereas only the one with the lowest density was detected when the supernatant recovered after ultracentrifugation was loaded onto the sucrose gradient. The three further aggregate sub-classes were otherwise indistinctly precipitated in the pellet. The distribution of the recombinant protein among the four subclasses was strongly dependent on the DnaK availability, with larger aggregates formed in Dnak- mutants. The aggregation state of the GFP-GST recovered from each of the four fractions was further characterized by examining three independent biochemical parameters. All of them showed an increased complexity of the recombinant protein aggregates starting from the top of the sucrose gradient (lower mass aggregates) to the bottom (larger mass aggregates). These results were also confirmed by electron microscopy analysis of the macro-structure formed by the different aggregates. Large fibrils were rapidly assembled when the recombinant protein was incubated in the presence of cellular extracts, but the GFP-GST fusion purified soon after lysis failed to undergo amyloidation, indicating that other cell components probably participate in the active formation of large aggregates. Finally, we showed that aggregates of lower complexity are more efficiently disaggregated by a combination of molecular chaperones.ConclusionAn additional analytical tool is now available to investigate the aggregation process and separate subclasses by their mass. It was possible to demonstrate the complexity of the aggregation pattern of a recombinant protein expressed in bacteria and to characterize biochemically the different aggregate subclasses. Furthermore, we have obtained evidence that the cellular environment plays a role in the development of the aggregates and the problem of the artifact generation of aggregates has been discussed using in vitro models. Finally, the possibility of separating aggregate fractions with different complexities offers new options for biotechnological strategies aimed at improving the yield of folded and active recombinant proteins."

Despite these advantages, E. coli-based protein production faces significant challenges, with protein misfolding, aggregation, and inclusion body formation being the most prevalent obstacles <Paper corpusId=\"12023504\" paperTitle=\"(Platas et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"262692133\" paperTitle=\"(Gasser et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInclusion bodies (IBs) are dense aggregates of misfolded polypeptides that form when the host cell's protein folding machinery becomes overwhelmed <Paper corpusId=\"13850343\" paperTitle=\"(Ventura, 2005)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"1502044\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This phenomenon occurs because the innate E. coli proteostasis network capacity is often insufficient to support the efficient folding of large quantities of a protein-of-interest while simultaneously maintaining the endogenous proteome during bacterial cell growth <Paper corpusId=\"6380682\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. The formation of inclusion bodies is particularly problematic when proteins are intended for therapeutic uses, as it can compromise both yield and biological activity <Paper corpusId=\"12023504\" paperTitle=\"(Platas et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46654714\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Fruitos et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHigh-level production of recombinant proteins imposes significant stress on the host organism, triggering a heat-shock-like response that involves the induction of chaperones, foldases, and proteases <Paper corpusId=\"1609760\" paperTitle=\"(Dragosits et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. The formation of inclusion bodies has traditionally been viewed as a major bottleneck in protein production processes, necessitating elaborate downstream processing including denaturation and renaturation methods <Paper corpusId=\"1609760\" paperTitle=\"(Dragosits et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"264615304\" paperTitle=\"(Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. Typically, inclusion body proteins need to be solubilized using high concentrations of chaotropic agents such as urea and guanidinium chloride before being refolded into their functional state <Paper corpusId=\"49864461\" paperTitle=\"(Sheli et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, recent research has challenged the traditional view that inclusion bodies consist entirely of misfolded and inactive proteins, suggesting that IB-trapped proteins may retain some functionality <Paper corpusId=\"1609760\" paperTitle=\"(Dragosits et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the formation of inclusion bodies can sometimes be advantageous, as it facilitates initial protein enrichment during purification processes <Paper corpusId=\"1609760\" paperTitle=\"(Dragosits et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Nevertheless, inclusion body formation remains a significant challenge in recombinant protein production, particularly affecting the yield and solubility of the final product.\n\nUnderstanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying protein folding challenges and inclusion body formation is crucial for developing effective strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli <Paper corpusId=\"12023504\" paperTitle=\"(Platas et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46654714\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Fruitos et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. These mechanisms involve complex interactions between the recombinant protein, the host cell's protein quality control systems, and various environmental factors that influence protein folding and aggregation.",

The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production.

                            "Escherichia coli retains its dominant position as the first choice of host for the high-throughput production of proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest because of rapid biomass accumulation, well-established genetic manipulation methods and simple process scale-up (Baneyx, 1999)(Swartz, 2001). However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides (Kane et al., 1991). Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding (Langenhof et al., 2005). Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers (Clark et al., 1998)(Kiefhaber et al., 1990). Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization can dominate the rate and pathway of protein folding and in turn determine the refolding efficiency [7](Tan et al., 1997)."

                            "Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109]110]."

However, very often the target protein accumulates into insoluble aggregates in a misfolded and biologically inactive form. Bacterial inclusion bodies are major bottlenecks in protein production and are hampering the development of top priority research areas such structural genomics. Inclusion body formation was formerly considered to occur via non-specific association of hydrophobic surfaces in folding intermediates. Increasing evidence, however, indicates that protein aggregation in bacteria resembles to the well-studied process of amyloid fibril formation. Both processes appear to rely on the formation of specific, sequence-dependent, intermolecular interactions driving the formation of structured protein aggregates."

Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many recombinant proteins form inclusion bodies (IBs) which represent insoluble protein aggregates and necessitates elaborate downstream processing including de/re-naturation methods (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). Recent work shows that IB-trapped proteins may actually be used directly [11], a result that contradicts the traditional thinking that IBs consist of misfolded, and thus inactive, protein. Still, in both cases further processing is needed to achieve soluble protein products (Nahalka et al., 2008). On the other hand, the formation of inclusion bodies can also represent a favorable factor as the formation of such insoluble protein greatly facilitates initial protein enrichment."

Although recombinant protein production via inclusion body formation system looks attractive due to attributes such as relatively straightforward IB generation to high yields, good supply of soluble protein after applying a solubilization treatment and potential clear-cut purification of target protein to high purities, IB proteins mostly contain non-functional target proteins which need to be solubilized by denaturants (e.g., high concentrations of chaotropic agents including urea and guanidinium chloride) and then refolded to functional (bioactive) counterparts (Overton, 2014)[3]."

Under physiological conditions, these factors maintain quality control of protein biosynthesis, and errors or failures of the protein folding process are rare. However, incorrectly folded or misfolded proteins can appear as a result of (i) spontaneous or inducible mutations that affect protein folding pathways, (ii) exposure of the cell to environmental stress, such as elevated temperatures or hyperosmolarity, and (iii) overexpression of recombinant genes. In these cases, the polypeptide chain, instead of folding into the native biologically active state, misfolds, and eventually induces a stress response (Goff et al., 1985). The resulting misfolded proteins may either be degraded by proteases, repaired by chaperones, or aggregated and sequestered as inclusion bodies (IBs), when escaping protein folding quality control (Wickner et al., 1999)."

                            "Rapid production of recombinant proteins can lead to the formation of insoluble aggregates designated as inclusion bodies (Betts et al., 1999). These are large, spherical particles which are clearly separated from the cytoplasm and result from the failure of the quality control system to repair or remove misfolded or unfolded protein. \n\nThe formation of inclusion bodies does not correlate with (1) the size of the synthesized polypeptide, (2) the use of the fusion construct, (3) the subunit structure and (4) the relative hydrophobicity of the recombinant protein. Overproduction by itself (the increase in the concentration of the nascent polypeptide chains) can be sufficient to induce the formation of inclusion bodies. These aggregates do not consist of pure recombinant polypeptide chains, but contain several impurities such as host proteins (RNA polymerase, outer membrane proteins), ribosomal components and circular and nicked forms of plasmid DNA. In addition, they might contain the small heat shock proteins IbpA and IbpB. Strategies to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies are aimed to slow down the production of recombinant proteins and include (1) low-copy number vectors, (2) weak promoters, (3) low temperature, (4) coexpression of molecular chaperones, (5) use of a solubilizing partner, and (6) fermentation at extreme pH values."

                            "When heterologous recombinant proteins are produced in Escherichia coli, they often precipitate to form insoluble aggregates of unfolded polypeptides called inclusion bodies. These structures are associated with chaperones like IbpA. However, there are reported cases of \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies in which proteins are soluble, folded and active.\n\nIB formation results from the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides that have escaped quality control by chaperones and proteases to interact through their exposed hydrophobic regions before precipitating [3]. Aggregate formation and features are influenced by various growth conditions such as temperature and pH [4], culture phase [5] and glucose/oxygen availability [6].\n\nIn vivo protein aggregation is a dynamic reversible process [7]. Chaperones involved in aggregate dissociation, e.g. DnaK/DnaJ/ClpB and IbpA/IbpB, colocalize with IB in E. coli [8][9][10][11]. Recently, it has been reported that aggregate cellular localization is not random [9]. Small protein aggregates are delivered to a cell pole to form larger structures that are further dissolved by an energy dependent process [12]. All proteins in IB were initially considered as unfolded, but it has been shown that some polypeptides inside aggregates are present in an active form [2,13,14]. Several groups reported the formation of \"non-classical\" IB mainly characterized by the presence of folded and soluble recombinant proteins [15]16]."

The factors that determine IB formation include the nature of the protein expressed (v. gr., protein sequence), growth and induction conditions, cytoplasmic reducing environment, kinetic competition between aggregation and folding, high local protein concentration, inappropriate interactions with in vivo folding chaperones, intermolecular disulfide crosslinking (although proteins lacking cysteines can still form inclusion bodies), medium composition, and bacterial strain [137,[150][151][152][153]. Accumulation of the recombinant protein in IB has certain advantages, as it can be isolated and concentrated by a simple centrifugation step, reducing the downstream processing costs and facilitating the production of toxic proteins to cells [154][155][156]."

                            "BackgroundIn the interest of generating large amounts of recombinant protein, inducible systems have been studied to maximize both the growth of the culture and the production of foreign proteins. Even though thermo-inducible systems were developed in the late 1970's, the number of studies that focus on strategies for the implementation at bioreactor scale is limited. In this work, the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter is once again investigated as an inducible element but for the production of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Culture temperature, induction point, induction duration and number of inductions were considered as factors to maximize GFP production in a 20-L bioreactor.ResultsIt was found that cultures carried out at 37\u00b0C resulted in a growth-associated production of GFP without the need of an induction at 42\u00b0C. Specific production was similar to what was achieved when separating the growth and production phases. Shake flask cultures were used to screen for desirable operating conditions. It was found that multiple inductions increased the production of GFP. Induction decreased the growth rate and substrate yield coefficients; therefore, two time domains (before and after induction) having different kinetic parameters were created to fit a model to the data collected.ConclusionBased on two batch runs and the simulation of culture dynamics, a pre-defined feeding and induction strategy was developed to increase the volumetric yield of a temperature regulated expression system and was successfully implemented in a 20-L bioreactor. An overall cell density of 5.95 g DW l-1 was achieved without detriment to the cell specific production of GFP; however, the production of GFP was underestimated in the simulations due to a significant contribution of non-growth associated product formation under limiting nutrient conditions."

                            "A major challenge in obtaining a recombinant protein is correct folding. A protein synthesized in a recombinant cell is often produced in reduced form, which is then oxidized (refolded) using suitable folding conditions (Clark, 1998)(Rudolph et al., 1996). The target crude peptide/protein can be obtained in reduced form and then refolded with the aid of various enzymes as disulfide catalyst systems [95](\ud0a4\uc2a4\ud1a4 et al., 1985). Alternatively, oxidative folding is possible without the use of any enzyme (Freedman, 1995)(Frand et al., 2000). However, such refolding can be a problematic step. Misfolding is a major issue with cysteine-containing polypeptides resulting in low yields. This limitation has necessitated the development of new methodologies to enable the acquisition of correctly folded protein or peptide in its native form in high yields. To assist the refolding, various tactics have been employed including inclusion body formation (Luan et al., 2014)(Alibolandi et al., 2011), co-expression of supporting enzymes (Sandee et al., 2005)(Kondo et al., 2000) and chemical assistance (Alibolandi et al., 2011)."

In vitro refolding of inclusion body into proteins with native conformations is a solution for this problem but there is a need for optimization of condition for each protein specifically. Several approaches have been described for in vitro refolding; most of them involve the use of additives for assisting correct folding. Cosolutes play a major role in refolding process and can be classified according to their function as aggregation suppressors and folding enhancers. This paper presents a review of additives that are used in refolding process of insoluble recombinant proteins in small scale and industrial processes."

Most proteins, especially those with multiple disulfide bonds, have been shown to form insoluble protein or inclusion body in E. coli. An inactive form of protein would require an in vitro refolding step to regain biological functions. In this study, we described the system for soluble expression of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep27scFv) by coexpressing Dsb protein and enhancing with medium additives. The results revealed that overexpression of DsbABCD protein showed marked effect on the soluble production of Hep27scFv, presumably facilitating correct folding. The optimal condition for soluble scFv expression could be obtained by adding 0.5M sorbitol to the culture medium. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that soluble scFv expressed by our method retains binding activity toward the same epitope on a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HCC-S102) recognized by intact antibody (Ab) (Hep27 Mab). Here, we report an effective method for soluble expression of scFv in E. coli by the Dsb coexpression system with the addition of sorbitol medium additive. This method might be applicable for high-yield soluble expression of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds."

One major limitation is E. coli's relatively simple protein folding machinery, which lacks the sophisticated post-translational modification capabilities found in eukaryotic systems <Paper corpusId=\"31546198\" paperTitle=\"(Francis et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This becomes particularly problematic when expressing complex eukaryotic proteins that require longer folding times or specific chaperones to reach their native state <Paper corpusId=\"31546198\" paperTitle=\"(Francis et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe cytoplasmic redox environment of E. coli presents another significant challenge. The bacterial cytoplasm is highly reductive due to the presence of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which effectively reduce disulfide bonds back to free thiols <Paper corpusId=\"272055653\" paperTitle=\"(Solowinska et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reducing environment is particularly problematic for recombinant proteins requiring disulfide bonds for structural stability, as these bonds are essential for proper folding and functionality in many eukaryotic proteins <Paper corpusId=\"272055653\" paperTitle=\"(Solowinska et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"34983770\" paperTitle=\"(Scheiblhofer et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.

However, when recombinant proteins are overexpressed, the limited capacity of these systems can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation <Paper corpusId=\"6392822\" paperTitle=\"(Marco et al., 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe expression rate also significantly influences protein folding outcomes. High expression rates driven by strong promoters or high inducer concentrations can overwhelm the cell's folding machinery, leading to increased inclusion body formation <Paper corpusId=\"272645465\" paperTitle=\"(Kuri et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "The rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity.\n\nkaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool of partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded, insoluble proteins (Oberg et al., 1994). Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein."

This is unfavorable, as incomplete or incorrect folding can inhibit both the formation of conformational epitopes and the exposure of linear epitopes (Scheiblhofer et al., 2017). Two strategies can be employed to circumvent this issue: \n\n(1) taking steps to prevent the formation of aggregates or (2) solubilization and refolding of target proteins from inclusion bodies in vitro. \n\nOften, the challenge of achieving native protein conformations increases with the number of cysteine residues due to the various possible isoforms and complexity of disulfide bond patterns [80]. The correct folding of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in E. coli systems is limited by the reducing cytoplasmic environment maintained by several cellular components, including the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which are effective in reducing disulfide bonds back to free thiols (Baneyx et al., 2004)."

                            "ABSTRACT Introduction: In modern vaccinology and immunotherapy, recombinant proteins more and more replace whole organisms to induce protective or curative immune responses. Structural stability of proteins is of crucial importance for efficient presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC, which plays a decisive role for triggering strong immune reactions. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss structural stability as a key factor for modulating the potency of recombinant vaccines and its importance for antigen proteolysis, presentation, and stimulation of B and T cells. Moreover, the impact of fold stability on downstream events determining the differentiation of T cells into effector cells is reviewed. We summarize studies investigating the impact of protein fold stability on the outcome of the immune response and provide an overview on computational methods to estimate the effects of point mutations on protein stability. Expert commentary: Based on this information, the rational design of up-to-date vaccines is discussed. A model for predicting immunogenicity of proteins based on their conformational stability at different pH values is proposed."

                            "BackgroundThe first aim of the work was to analyze in detail the complexity of the aggregates formed upon overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A sucrose step gradient succeeded in separating aggregate subclasses of a GFP-GST fusion protein with specific biochemical and biophysical features, providing a novel approach for studying recombinant protein aggregates.ResultsThe total lysate separated into 4 different fractions whereas only the one with the lowest density was detected when the supernatant recovered after ultracentrifugation was loaded onto the sucrose gradient. The three further aggregate sub-classes were otherwise indistinctly precipitated in the pellet. The distribution of the recombinant protein among the four subclasses was strongly dependent on the DnaK availability, with larger aggregates formed in Dnak- mutants. The aggregation state of the GFP-GST recovered from each of the four fractions was further characterized by examining three independent biochemical parameters. All of them showed an increased complexity of the recombinant protein aggregates starting from the top of the sucrose gradient (lower mass aggregates) to the bottom (larger mass aggregates). These results were also confirmed by electron microscopy analysis of the macro-structure formed by the different aggregates. Large fibrils were rapidly assembled when the recombinant protein was incubated in the presence of cellular extracts, but the GFP-GST fusion purified soon after lysis failed to undergo amyloidation, indicating that other cell components probably participate in the active formation of large aggregates. Finally, we showed that aggregates of lower complexity are more efficiently disaggregated by a combination of molecular chaperones.ConclusionAn additional analytical tool is now available to investigate the aggregation process and separate subclasses by their mass. It was possible to demonstrate the complexity of the aggregation pattern of a recombinant protein expressed in bacteria and to characterize biochemically the different aggregate subclasses. Furthermore, we have obtained evidence that the cellular environment plays a role in the development of the aggregates and the problem of the artifact generation of aggregates has been discussed using in vitro models. Finally, the possibility of separating aggregate fractions with different complexities offers new options for biotechnological strategies aimed at improving the yield of folded and active recombinant proteins."

Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target."

While protein recovery from inclusion bodies is indeed possible, the process entails labour-intensive and time-consuming procedures, resulting in inevitable protein loss at each stage. Additionally, the absence of a universal technique emphasizes the necessity for a trialand-error approach to identify optimal strategies, thereby highlighting the intricate nature of protein handling in such instances",
                            "The inducer concentration profoundly influences the soluble protein fraction in E. coli expression systems. Higher concentrations typically yield elevated protein expression levels, potentially leading to a greater proportion of protein. Excessively high inducer concentrations can also lead to cellular stress or saturation of protein folding machinery, potentially causing misfolding, aggregation, and a decrease in solubility. Conversely, lower inducer concentrations may result in reduced protein expression but could enhance solubility by allowing for more controlled folding. However, excessively low inducer concentrations may not provide sufficient stimulation for protein expression, leading to inadequate levels of soluble protein. Thus, an optimal inducer concentration is crucial, striking a balance between robust protein expression and efficient folding to maximize soluble protein fraction while minimizing aggregation and cellular stress 52 ."

Additionally, E. coli has simple protein folding machinery, which lacks post-translational modifications. Due to the reducing potential of the E. coli cytoplasmic redox state, the production of proteins possessing more disulfide bonds still remains a challenge. The combination of all these factors, together with the exceeded solubility of over-expressed recombinant protein leads to the aggregation of recombinant proteins, which often gives rise to IBs formation.\n\nIBs were for a long time understood as inert deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins in some way separated from the cellular repair mechanism. However, it is now known that protein aggregation into IBs is reversible [26] and dependent on the physiological state of the host organism. IBs are very dynamic structures that are continuously formed in the host cell and simultaneously the proteins are also released from them and refolded or degraded by the cell repair mechanisms [27].\n\nSince protein aggregates represented an obstacle in recombinant protein production, various mechanisms that would enable production of soluble proteins in bacteria were studied. Yields of soluble protein expression can be increased by chaperone co-expression [28], fusion of target protein with suitable fusion tags [29], choosing appropriate host strain and promoter system or modifying the cultivation conditions (e.g., growth temperature, media composition) [17]. However, studies showed, that protein solubility does not imply protein activity, as large amount of the proteins found soluble in the cytoplasm can be biologically inactive [7]8]."

                            "Understanding the structure, functionalities and biology of functional amyloids is an issue of emerging interest. Inclusion bodies, namely protein clusters formed in recombinant bacteria during protein production processes, have emerged as unanticipated, highly tunable models for the scrutiny of the physiology and architecture of functional amyloids. Based on an amyloidal skeleton combined with varying amounts of native or native-like protein forms, bacterial inclusion bodies exhibit an unusual arrangement that confers mechanical stability, biological activity and conditional protein release, being thus exploitable as versatile biomaterials. The applicability of inclusion bodies in biotechnology as enriched sources of protein and reusable catalysts, and in biomedicine as biocompatible topographies, nanopills or mimetics of endocrine secretory granules has been largely validated. Beyond these uses, the dissection of how recombinant bacteria manage the aggregation of functional protein species into structures of highly variable complexity offers insights about unsuspected connections between protein quality (conformational status compatible with functionality) and cell physiology."

Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs (Kuczyn\u0301ska-Wis\u0301nik et al., 2004)(Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2006)[6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product (Hrab\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al., 2015)."

We investigated the effect of DeltaibpA/B mutation on formation of inclusion bodies and biological activity of enzymes sequestered in the aggregates in E. coli cells. Using three different recombinant proteins: Cro-beta-galactosidase, beta-lactamase and rat rHtrA1 we demonstrated that deletion of the ibpA/B operon did not affect the level of produced inclusion bodies. However, in aggregates containing IbpA/B a higher enzymatic activity was detected than in the IbpA/B-deficient inclusion bodies.

This results in aggregation of the folding intermediates into protein inclusion bodies throughout the bacterial cytoplasm. Interestingly, these inclusion bodies are pure in the recombinant protein and correctly folded forms may also be incorporated, leading to biologically active protein particles. Notably, an amorphous matrix fills the spaces between and inside the inclusion bodies, conceivably allowing diffusion of reactants. However, the characteristics of individual proteins greatly impact both whether the aggregates avoid degradation and whether active proteins (enzymes) can be incorporated."

These structures are associated with chaperones like IbpA. However, there are reported cases of \"non-classical\" inclusion bodies in which proteins are soluble, folded and active.\n\nIB formation results from the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides that have escaped quality control by chaperones and proteases to interact through their exposed hydrophobic regions before precipitating [3]. Aggregate formation and features are influenced by various growth conditions such as temperature and pH [4], culture phase [5] and glucose/oxygen availability [6].\n\nIn vivo protein aggregation is a dynamic reversible process [7]. Chaperones involved in aggregate dissociation, e.g. DnaK/DnaJ/ClpB and IbpA/IbpB, colocalize with IB in E. coli [8][9][10][11]. Recently, it has been reported that aggregate cellular localization is not random [9]. Small protein aggregates are delivered to a cell pole to form larger structures that are further dissolved by an energy dependent process [12]. All proteins in IB were initially considered as unfolded, but it has been shown that some polypeptides inside aggregates are present in an active form [2,13,14]. Several groups reported the formation of \"non-classical\" IB mainly characterized by the presence of folded and soluble recombinant proteins [15]16]."

Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many recombinant proteins form inclusion bodies (IBs) which represent insoluble protein aggregates and necessitates elaborate downstream processing including de/re-naturation methods (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). Recent work shows that IB-trapped proteins may actually be used directly [11], a result that contradicts the traditional thinking that IBs consist of misfolded, and thus inactive, protein. Still, in both cases further processing is needed to achieve soluble protein products (Nahalka et al., 2008).

                            "Production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins. One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012)."

The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production.

Overproduction by itself (the increase in the concentration of the nascent polypeptide chains) can be sufficient to induce the formation of inclusion bodies. These aggregates do not consist of pure recombinant polypeptide chains, but contain several impurities such as host proteins (RNA polymerase, outer membrane proteins), ribosomal components and circular and nicked forms of plasmid DNA. In addition, they might contain the small heat shock proteins IbpA and IbpB. Strategies to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies are aimed to slow down the production of recombinant proteins and include (1) low-copy number vectors, (2) weak promoters, (3) low temperature, (4) coexpression of molecular chaperones, (5) use of a solubilizing partner, and (6) fermentation at extreme pH values."

Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs (Kuczyn\u0301ska-Wis\u0301nik et al., 2004)(Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2006)[6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product (Hrab\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al., 2015)."

                            "Production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes or various functional studies requires a robust and cost-effective expression system which can synthesize heterologous proteins in soluble form. Although E. coli expression system is always a preferred choice for expression of recombinant proteins, accumulation of foreign proteins as insoluble aggregates, also called as inclusion bodies, is a major problem. Recovery of proteins from these inclusion bodies is a very cumbersome process which entails denaturation and renaturation steps to obtain recombinant protein in properly folded and soluble form. However, this extraction process causes tremendous loss of proteins and further reduces the total yield of biologically active recombinant proteins. One approach to enhance the solubility of heterologous protein and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies is to employ molecular chaperones. It is now known that molecular chaperones assist the nascent polypeptide to fold properly during the process of protein synthesis and thus prevent protein aggregation. Few molecular chaperones are found to improve folding and solubilization of misfolded protein, while other chaperones are involved in prevention of protein aggregation (Carrio et al., 2003)(Marco, 2007)(Ronez et al., 2012)."

It has been established that in vivo protein folding is an energy dependent process mediated by two classes folding modulators; molecular chaperones-DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES systems, which suppress offpathway aggregation reaction and lead to the proper folding through ATP-coordinated cycle of binding and release of intermediates [78]. Additionally, it accelerates rate-limiting steps along the protein folding pathway such as cis-trans isomerization of peptide-prolyl bonds and formation/reshuffling of disulfide-bridges [79,80]. These two chaperone system holds great promise in facilitating the production, purification and proper folding of heterologous protein [81]82]",

In absence of any chaperone protein, U can fold back to its native form (N) along with the aggregationprocess which leads to inclusion-bodies (Z); but in presence of chaperone protein U solely folds back to its native form (N) via an intermediate (I) with chaperone protein without any aggregation path which leads to inclusion bodies.

Protein expressed in an inclusion body form requires further steps for the folding process related to its purification. Whereas the purity level of the recombinant streptavidin is very crucial mainly for the specification test in diagnostic system. In this study, we designed synthetic gene of streptavidin to be fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene to enhance its solubility when expressed in E. coli BL21 (pD861-MBP: 327892) and purified using amylose resin with gradient column buffer. Based on the SDS-PAGE characterization, the majority of recombinant streptavidin was found in soluble than that of insoluble form. Recombinant streptavidin was found at its suitable size at 56.6 kDa in the soluble protein fraction with a concentration of 537.42 mg/L. The purest fraction of streptavidin recombinant was obtained at the 58th fraction in a concentration of 0.86 mg/L with purity level of 98.77%. Compared to the initial crude protein extract, the level of purity is lower, 6.03%. In summary, the MBP purification method improves the purity level and enhances the solubility of the recombinant streptavidin."

Escherichia coli is used for large-scale enzyme production because of its cost-effectiveness, rapid growth, and increased recombinant protein expression, but inclusion bodies can be formed during intracellular protein expression, so the maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag was used to improve the expression of soluble protein. The Tth DNA polymerase gene was optimized to have a codon adaptive index of 1.00% and 60.64% Guanine and Cytosine (GC) content, then inserted into E. coli BL21(DE3), which harbors pD861-His- Tth DNA polymerase and pD861-MBP- Tth DNA polymerase. The induction and postinduction incubation time were optimized to express pD861-His- Tth DNA polymerase and pD861-MBP- Tth DNA polymerase in the soluble form. The total protein concentration of His- Tth DNA polymerase is 3.9095 mg/ml while for MBP- Tth DNA polymerase it is 33.541 mg/ml; protein levels after optimization based on densitometry analysis show MBP- Tth DNA polymerase is seven times higher than His- Tth DNA polymerase.

                            "Upon over-expression, a high amount of proteins are constantly formed that cannot be simultaneously processed by the protein synthesis machinery, thus the quality control system is activated [25]. Additionally, E. coli has simple protein folding machinery, which lacks post-translational modifications. Due to the reducing potential of the E. coli cytoplasmic redox state, the production of proteins possessing more disulfide bonds still remains a challenge. The combination of all these factors, together with the exceeded solubility of over-expressed recombinant protein leads to the aggregation of recombinant proteins, which often gives rise to IBs formation.\n\nIBs were for a long time understood as inert deposits of misfolded and inactive proteins in some way separated from the cellular repair mechanism. However, it is now known that protein aggregation into IBs is reversible [26] and dependent on the physiological state of the host organism. IBs are very dynamic structures that are continuously formed in the host cell and simultaneously the proteins are also released from them and refolded or degraded by the cell repair mechanisms [27].\n\nSince protein aggregates represented an obstacle in recombinant protein production, various mechanisms that would enable production of soluble proteins in bacteria were studied. Yields of soluble protein expression can be increased by chaperone co-expression [28], fusion of target protein with suitable fusion tags [29], choosing appropriate host strain and promoter system or modifying the cultivation conditions (e.g., growth temperature, media composition) [17]. However, studies showed, that protein solubility does not imply protein activity, as large amount of the proteins found soluble in the cytoplasm can be biologically inactive [7]8]."

To address this challenge, various strategies have been devised, such as using MBP-tagged fusion proteins, refolding with the freezethawing method, adding a redox system (GSH/GSSG), and coexpression with chaperone [15][16][17][18][19].\n\nChaperones are proteins that aid in monitoring nonnative conformations, stabilizing proteins, and facilitating the folding process, despite not being part of the final native structure of the protein [20]. The co-expression of chaperones with heterologous proteins in E. coli has been shown to elevate the soluble fraction and diminish the occurrence of inclusion body formation. As indicated by reference [21], concurrent coexpression of GroEL/ES and Trigger factor in E. coli facilitates protein folding and impedes the formation of inclusion bodies in recombinant proteins. GroE proteins are molecular chaperones derived from E. coli, with GroEL and GroES encoding proteins of sizes 57 kDa and 10-15 kDa, respectively [22]. The GroEL rings create a cavity serving as a folding chamber for polypeptide substrates [23]. GroES functions as a co-chaperone for GroEL. Another relevant chaperone is the Trigger Factor, which operates independently of ATP and has a molecular weight of 48 kDa [24]."

The process of obtaining bioactive protein from inclusion bodies is labor intensive and the yields of recombinant protein are often low. Here we review the developments in the field that are targeted at improving the yield, as well as quality of the recombinant protein by optimizing the individual steps of the process, especially solubilization of the inclusion bodies and refolding of the solubilized protein. Mild solubilization methods have been discussed which are based on the understanding of the fact that protein molecules in inclusion body aggregates have native-like structure. These methods solubilize the inclusion body aggregates while preserving the native-like protein structure. Subsequent protein refolding and purification results in high recovery of bioactive protein. Other parameters which influence the overall recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies have also been discussed. A schematic model describing the utility of mild solubilization methods for high throughput recovery of bioactive protein has also been presented."

                            "Antibodies have been used for basic research, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic applications. Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies. Variable antibody genes have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteines. However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity."

Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs (Kuczyn\u0301ska-Wis\u0301nik et al., 2004)(Garcia-Fruit\u00f3s et al., 2006)[6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product (Hrab\u00e1rov\u00e1 et al., 2015)."

                            "Escherichia coli retains its dominant position as the first choice of host for the high-throughput production of proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest because of rapid biomass accumulation, well-established genetic manipulation methods and simple process scale-up (Baneyx, 1999)(Swartz, 2001). However, a major disadvantage derived from the intrinsic properties of E. coli is the frequent formation of an inclusion body, a dense aggregate of misfolded polypeptides (Kane et al., 1991). Refolding the inclusion bodies into the native conformation might be straightforward if an efficient refolding scheme is established. There are a variety of conventional methodologies for refolding recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies, which contains simple dilution, dialysis and chromatographic refolding methods. Dilution is the simplest and most widely used technique and involves refolding initiation by reducing the denaturant concentration. However, the target product in dilution refolding can be obtained only very low yield because of protein aggregation at high protein concentration. Column-based refolding is the most likely to renaturate the protein aggregates at high concentration and to reduce the cost for reagents and buffers in largescale protein refolding (Langenhof et al., 2005). Although these conventional methods are commonly used for protein refolding and quite progress has been made, disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization have often frustrated the successful refolding of insoluble recombinant proteins containing cysteine and proline in multiple numbers (Clark et al., 1998)(Kiefhaber et al., 1990). Generation of correct disulfide bonds and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans configuration are required processes for formation and stabilization of the native protein conformation. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics of disulfide bond formation and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization can dominate the rate and pathway of protein folding and in turn determine the refolding efficiency [7](Tan et al., 1997)."

The isomerisation of one or more of these peptidyl-proline bonds to the cis conformation in the denatured state gives rise to heterogeneity, leading to both fast and slow-folding species. The refolding of the fast-folding species, which has all trans peptidyl-proline bonds, is much faster than that of the slow-folding species, which have one or more cis peptidyl-proline bonds. In CI2, the slow-folding species can be classified into two groups by their rates of refolding, temperature-dependence, pH-dependence and [GdmCl]-dependence of the rate constants and the effect of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase on the rate constants. The replacement of Pro6 by Ala removes one of the slow refolding phases, suggesting that the cis peptidyl-Pro6 conformation is solely responsible for one of the slow-folding species. Pro6 is located in a region of the protein where non-random interactions have been found in a series of N-terminal fragments of CI2 (residues 1 to 13, 1 to 25, 1 to 28 and 1 to 40). In addition, NMR studies on a mutant fragment, (1-40)T3A, have confirmed that this non-native interaction is associated with the bulky side-chain of Trp5. The atypical rate of cis to trans isomerisation of the peptidyl-Pro bond is indicative of the presence of a similar hydrophobic cluster in the physiological denatured state of intact CI2."

                            "Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used as an integral host for production of recombinant proteins in biopharmaceutical industry; however, production of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been associated with serious challenges. One major part of challenges is related to the fact that the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli often leads to the formation of misfolded protein aggregates, called inclusion bodies (IBs), mainly because of differences in folding pathways and physicochemical conditions between expression and natural hosts (Wyre et al., 2014). Although recombinant protein production via inclusion body formation system looks attractive due to attributes such as relatively straightforward IB generation to high yields, good supply of soluble protein after applying a solubilization treatment and potential clear-cut purification of target protein to high purities, IB proteins mostly contain non-functional target proteins which need to be solubilized by denaturants (e.g., high concentrations of chaotropic agents including urea and guanidinium chloride) and then refolded to functional (bioactive) counterparts (Overton, 2014)[3]."

IbpA/B are induced during overproduction of recombinant proteins and bind to inclusion bodies in E. coli cells. We investigated the effect of DeltaibpA/B mutation on formation of inclusion bodies and biological activity of enzymes sequestered in the aggregates in E. coli cells. Using three different recombinant proteins: Cro-beta-galactosidase, beta-lactamase and rat rHtrA1 we demonstrated that deletion of the ibpA/B operon did not affect the level of produced inclusion bodies. However, in aggregates containing IbpA/B a higher enzymatic activity was detected than in the IbpA/B-deficient inclusion bodies. These results confirm that IbpA/B protect misfolded proteins from inactivation in vivo."
