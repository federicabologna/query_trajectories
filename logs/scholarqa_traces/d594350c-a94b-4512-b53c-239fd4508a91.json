The Biobrick system includes a registry of available genetic information and a set of standard protocols for assembling and testing them, which finds various significant uses in synthetic biology, such as in the production of \"Fourth generation\u201d biofuel. Genetic engineering techniques may be applied to manipulate crops or microbes for more efficient biofuel production. Such synthetic biology techniques also include modification of lignin structure and content, use of bacterial enzymes abundantly expressed in plants, and manipulation of hemicellulose biosynthesis. However, challenges such as high temperature, efficient conversion of all substrate molecules for maximum product yield, efficient pentose fermentation, and tolerance to acetic acid and bioethanol concentration can all impact the yield of the product. This article explores innovative genetic modification approaches designed to decrease lignin levels and enhance crop digestibility in plants, with a specific focus on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and herbaceous plants such as Alfalfa. The aim is to manipulate the Monolignol pathway and modify the CSE gene, known for its ability to decrease lignin content. These modifications have been shown to significantly improve saccharification efficiency and increase the yield of lignocellulosic bioethanol. Besides, the role of xylulose-5-phosphate as an intermediate in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and the use of heterologous xylose transporters and modified sugar transporters as potential solutions to improve the biofuel production efficiency is also discussed in this review article.",

                    "text": "One of the most efficient tools of synthetic biology is the Biobrick system, based on the use of standardized genetic parts that can be easily assembled to create new biological systems [3]. The Biobrick standard, developed by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, has since become a widely accepted standard in the field of synthetic biology [3]. Biobrick are DNA sequences that include promoters, coding sequences, and terminators, which are the basic building blocks of genetic engineering [3]. They are similar to electronic components in that they can be used to create complex systems by combining them in different ways. The Biobrick system also includes an archive of available genetic parts and a set of standard protocols for assembling and testing these parts [3]. One of the main benefits of using Biobrick is that they are exchangeable, meaning that they can be used in different biological systems without requiring significant modification [3]. This allows for the rapid and efficient construction of new biological systems, as well as the ability to test different combinations of parts to optimize performance [3]. Additionally, Biobrick are well-characterized, meaning that their function and behavior have been thoroughly studied and tested, which allows for greater predictability and reliability when building new systems [4]. Biobrick have been used in a wide range of applications in synthetic biology, including the production of biofuels, the detection of pollutants, and the creation of novel medical treatments. For example, Biobricks have been used to design bacteria that can convert plant material into biofuels, as well as to create biosensors that can detect pollutants in the environment [4].",

The Biobrick system includes a registry of available genetic information and a set of standard protocols for assembling and testing them, which finds various significant uses in synthetic biology, such as in the production of \"Fourth generation\u201d biofuel. Genetic engineering techniques may be applied to manipulate crops or microbes for more efficient biofuel production. Such synthetic biology techniques also include modification of lignin structure and content, use of bacterial enzymes abundantly expressed in plants, and manipulation of hemicellulose biosynthesis. However, challenges such as high temperature, efficient conversion of all substrate molecules for maximum product yield, efficient pentose fermentation, and tolerance to acetic acid and bioethanol concentration can all impact the yield of the product. This article explores innovative genetic modification approaches designed to decrease lignin levels and enhance crop digestibility in plants, with a specific focus on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and herbaceous plants such as Alfalfa. The aim is to manipulate the Monolignol pathway and modify the CSE gene, known for its ability to decrease lignin content. These modifications have been shown to significantly improve saccharification efficiency and increase the yield of lignocellulosic bioethanol. Besides, the role of xylulose-5-phosphate as an intermediate in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and the use of heterologous xylose transporters and modified sugar transporters as potential solutions to improve the biofuel production efficiency is also discussed in this review article.\n## Biobrick System\nOne of the most efficient tools of synthetic biology is the Biobrick system, based on the use of standardized genetic parts that can be easily assembled to create new biological systems [3]. The Biobrick standard, developed by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, has since become a widely accepted standard in the field of synthetic biology [3]. Biobrick are DNA sequences that include promoters, coding sequences, and terminators, which are the basic building blocks of genetic engineering [3]. They are similar to electronic components in that they can be used to create complex systems by combining them in different ways. The Biobrick system also includes an archive of available genetic parts and a set of standard protocols for assembling and testing these parts [3]. One of the main benefits of using Biobrick is that they are exchangeable, meaning that they can be used in different biological systems without requiring significant modification [3]. This allows for the rapid and efficient construction of new biological systems, as well as the ability to test different combinations of parts to optimize performance [3]. Additionally, Biobrick are well-characterized, meaning that their function and behavior have been thoroughly studied and tested, which allows for greater predictability and reliability when building new systems [4]. Biobrick have been used in a wide range of applications in synthetic biology, including the production of biofuels, the detection of pollutants, and the creation of novel medical treatments. For example, Biobricks have been used to design bacteria that can convert plant material into biofuels, as well as to create biosensors that can detect pollutants in the environment [4].",

The field terms these elements as parts, which acknowledges the intent for each genetic element to be used in a modular fashion. For example, promoters, repressors, and reporters can be used again and again in disparate studies with the hope that each part will perform consistently. This has led to the creation of a parts registry [62] and a database where increasing numbers of biological parts are added [22]. Several coordinated efforts have been aimed at defining and refining each part for not only their activity but quality [6,41].\n\nThis collective effort to produce modular and standardized genetic parts to aid in synthetic biology applications is bolstered in large part by community building [21]. Apart from international conferences, the field of synthetic biology is fed by the recruitment and activity of young researchers through the highly active International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), which has been held annually since 2004 [63]. As a requirement for this student competition, each group contributes new parts and refinements of parts to the BioBricks database. Such collection and standardization of parts can be used to build not only devices such as logic gates [37], but also larger and larger systems [44], using the principles of engineering.",

The gene editing system CRISPR makes genetic changes easy [15] (even with commercial kits being offered to the home market (e.g., [64]).\n\nChallenges remain in several areas. One of the most overlooked aspects of living systems is the amount of inherent noise. In efforts to program organisms with precisely designed genetic constructs, it is often the case that the construct does not perform as intended, due to the variability produced by the host organism. One challenge on this front is to understand how to modulate or control the inherent noise to an acceptable level (if possible) or to understand how to use the inherent noise to the benefit of the system. Related to that challenge is how to produce sustainable genetically modified systems using standard genetic elements such as plasmids. Genetic circuits can function in a host cell for minutes to days before the system becomes nonfunctional, typically due to the loss of plasmids over time. The development of sophisticated feedback mechanisms may allow for sustained function of genetic constructs over time. Again related to the above challenges is the challenge of understanding the toll on the fitness of the engineered organism. How does the metabolic burden manifest itself, what are the underlying mechanisms, and are the effects additive?\n\nStandardization and modularity continue to play a primary role in the refinement of synthetic biology research and practices. With the development of tools and techniques in synthetic biology, deeper questions in biology may become experimentally tractable: for example, the nature of noise, attractor states, embodiment, mutation regimes, biological optimization, and information transfer, to name a few. So far, most of these considerations are appropriately considered for short time scales, for example, from hours to days of functionality. The long-term visions of genetic manipulations are not clearly defined, although they are being discussed. Although synthetic biology provides more control over genetic systems, the limits to the amount of engineering possible in biological systems are yet to be elucidated.",

There is a commercial dimension as well, where living organisms are engineered as green technologies that could offer alternatives to industrial standards in the pharmaceutical and petroleum-based chemical industries. This review attempts to provide an introduction to this field as well as a consideration of important contributions that exemplify how synthetic biology may be commensurate or even disproportionate with the complexity of living systems. The engineerability of living systems remains a difficult task, yet advancements are reported at an ever-increasing pace.\n## Parts, Modularity, Standardization\nAs a discipline, synthetic biology aims to fully characterize the genetic elements it needs to build new genetic circuits and modify the behavior of organisms. The field terms these elements as parts, which acknowledges the intent for each genetic element to be used in a modular fashion. For example, promoters, repressors, and reporters can be used again and again in disparate studies with the hope that each part will perform consistently. This has led to the creation of a parts registry [62] and a database where increasing numbers of biological parts are added [22]. Several coordinated efforts have been aimed at defining and refining each part for not only their activity but quality [6,41].\n\nThis collective effort to produce modular and standardized genetic parts to aid in synthetic biology applications is bolstered in large part by community building [21]. Apart from international conferences, the field of synthetic biology is fed by the recruitment and activity of young researchers through the highly active International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), which has been held annually since 2004 [63]. As a requirement for this student competition, each group contributes new parts and refinements of parts to the BioBricks database. Such collection and standardization of parts can be used to build not only devices such as logic gates [37], but also larger and larger systems [44], using the principles of engineering.\n\n## Conclusions\nGenes can be transferred successfully from one organism to another, and the level of gene expression and activity can be changed using different promoters and/or copy numbers of the genes or balanced with rates of degradation. The gene editing system CRISPR makes genetic changes easy [15] (even with commercial kits being offered to the home market (e.g., [64]).\n\nChallenges remain in several areas. One of the most overlooked aspects of living systems is the amount of inherent noise. In efforts to program organisms with precisely designed genetic constructs, it is often the case that the construct does not perform as intended, due to the variability produced by the host organism. One challenge on this front is to understand how to modulate or control the inherent noise to an acceptable level (if possible) or to understand how to use the inherent noise to the benefit of the system. Related to that challenge is how to produce sustainable genetically modified systems using standard genetic elements such as plasmids. Genetic circuits can function in a host cell for minutes to days before the system becomes nonfunctional, typically due to the loss of plasmids over time. The development of sophisticated feedback mechanisms may allow for sustained function of genetic constructs over time. Again related to the above challenges is the challenge of understanding the toll on the fitness of the engineered organism. How does the metabolic burden manifest itself, what are the underlying mechanisms, and are the effects additive?\n\nStandardization and modularity continue to play a primary role in the refinement of synthetic biology research and practices. With the development of tools and techniques in synthetic biology, deeper questions in biology may become experimentally tractable: for example, the nature of noise, attractor states, embodiment, mutation regimes, biological optimization, and information transfer, to name a few. So far, most of these considerations are appropriately considered for short time scales, for example, from hours to days of functionality. The long-term visions of genetic manipulations are not clearly defined, although they are being discussed. Although synthetic biology provides more control over genetic systems, the limits to the amount of engineering possible in biological systems are yet to be elucidated.",

A large portion of synthetic biology innovation has occurred under a framework of iterative cycles of \"design-build-test\" development. Growth in the field of synthetic biology can be correlated with innovations in each of the \"design\", \"build\", and \"test\" processes [2]. For example, there has been a significant effort in the standardization of parts within synthetic biology, with modularity and \"plug and play\" components receiving significant attention. Combined with the steady progress of systems biology, this modularization has enabled the \"design\" phase to become less time consuming and less dependent on specialized knowledge. The cost of DNA sequencing and synthesis has also decreased significantly in recent years, allowing the cheap synthesis of large constructs [3]. This has allowed a rapid improvement in the \"build\" phase, enabling researchers to explore a greater proportion of the biological solution space. Finally, high-throughput screening has also become a focal point within the synthetic biology \"test\" phase. The increased capacity for \"design\", and \"build\" has led to an increased need for throughput in assessing the plethora of new designs. In part, this has been achieved with the incorporation of robotics and high-throughput analytics into the laboratory setting, wherein new designs can be assayed at a volume not possible for human researchers [4]. \n\nBiosensors represent a revolutionary new technology that can be implemented for highthroughput screening. They are most simply defined as an analytical tool comprised of biological components that are used to detect the presence of a target ligand and to generate a signal [5]. Biosensors are at the forefront of synthetic biology, both as a tool for high-throughput screening, but also as the direct result of advances within the synthetic biology field itself. Furthermore, biosensors have received increased attention as alternatives to traditional analytics due to the unparalleled specificity and sensitivity that biological parts afford compared to conventional analytical techniques.",

Williams\n## Abstract\nBiosensors are enabling major advances in the field of analytics that are both facilitating and being facilitated by advances in synthetic biology. The ability of biosensors to rapidly and specifically detect a wide range of molecules makes them highly relevant to a range of industrial, medical, ecological, and scientific applications. Approaches to biosensor design are as diverse as their applications, with major biosensor classes including nucleic acids, proteins, and transcription factors. Each of these biosensor types has advantages and limitations based on the intended application, and the parameters that are required for optimal performance. Specifically, the choice of biosensor design must consider factors such as the ligand specificity, sensitivity, dynamic range, functional range, mode of output, time of activation, ease of use, and ease of engineering. This review discusses the rationale for designing the major classes of biosensor in the context of their limitations and assesses their suitability to different areas of biotechnological application.\n## Introduction\nIn the past decade, the field of synthetic biology has flourished, significantly impacting fields such as metabolic engineering, protein engineering, computational biology, and whole-genome engineering [1]. A large portion of synthetic biology innovation has occurred under a framework of iterative cycles of \"design-build-test\" development. Growth in the field of synthetic biology can be correlated with innovations in each of the \"design\", \"build\", and \"test\" processes [2]. For example, there has been a significant effort in the standardization of parts within synthetic biology, with modularity and \"plug and play\" components receiving significant attention. Combined with the steady progress of systems biology, this modularization has enabled the \"design\" phase to become less time consuming and less dependent on specialized knowledge. The cost of DNA sequencing and synthesis has also decreased significantly in recent years, allowing the cheap synthesis of large constructs [3]. This has allowed a rapid improvement in the \"build\" phase, enabling researchers to explore a greater proportion of the biological solution space. Finally, high-throughput screening has also become a focal point within the synthetic biology \"test\" phase. The increased capacity for \"design\", and \"build\" has led to an increased need for throughput in assessing the plethora of new designs. In part, this has been achieved with the incorporation of robotics and high-throughput analytics into the laboratory setting, wherein new designs can be assayed at a volume not possible for human researchers [4]. \n\nBiosensors represent a revolutionary new technology that can be implemented for highthroughput screening. They are most simply defined as an analytical tool comprised of biological components that are used to detect the presence of a target ligand and to generate a signal [5]. Biosensors are at the forefront of synthetic biology, both as a tool for high-throughput screening, but also as the direct result of advances within the synthetic biology field itself. Furthermore, biosensors have received increased attention as alternatives to traditional analytics due to the unparalleled specificity and sensitivity that biological parts afford compared to conventional analytical techniques.",

Synthetic biology covers a broad research area, which combines the disciplines in biology and engineering. It aims to design and create new biological systems to perform functions that are not found in nature. The statement of \"synthetic biology\" was first appeared in 1980. Until recently, with the matureness of genetic tools, the rapid growth of synthetic biology in research, innovation, and policy interest has been seen [1]. The opinion was held that synthetic biology will bring to the industries of chemical synthesis (including materials, energy, and natural compounds), medicine, agriculture, and environment a surprising \"gift\". \n\nSynthetic biology is deemed as an emerging research field, which will bring new opportunities as well as challenges to biotechnology. Synthetic biology can be classified into three levels. First, new types of regulatory network are constructed using natural biological motifs or modules with known functions. The second is to synthesize genomic DNA and reconstruct the living body using de novo synthesis method.

Dong, M. Jiang, F. Xin\n## Abstract\nWith the increased development in research, innovation, and policy interest in recent years, biosynthetic technology has developed rapidly, which combines engineering, electronics, computer science, mathematics, and other disciplines based on classical genetic engineering and metabolic engineering. It gives a wider perspective and a deeper level to perceive the nature of life via cell mechanism, regulatory networks, or biological evolution. Currently, synthetic biology has made great breakthrough in energy, chemical industry, and medicine industries, particularly in the programmable genetic control at multiple levels of regulation to perform designed goals. In this review, the most advanced and comprehensive developments achieved in biosynthetic technology were represented, including genetic engineering as well as synthetic genomics. In addition, the superiority together with the limitations of the current genome-editing tools were summarized.\n## Background\nSynthetic biology is based on the study of system biology, using \"problem-oriented\" and \"bottom-up\" engineering design ideas to build standardized components and modules, which rebuilds existing natural systems to obtain new biological systems or de novo synthesize new artificial biological systems. Synthetic biology covers a broad research area, which combines the disciplines in biology and engineering. It aims to design and create new biological systems to perform functions that are not found in nature. The statement of \"synthetic biology\" was first appeared in 1980. Until recently, with the matureness of genetic tools, the rapid growth of synthetic biology in research, innovation, and policy interest has been seen [1]. The opinion was held that synthetic biology will bring to the industries of chemical synthesis (including materials, energy, and natural compounds), medicine, agriculture, and environment a surprising \"gift\". \n\nSynthetic biology is deemed as an emerging research field, which will bring new opportunities as well as challenges to biotechnology. Synthetic biology can be classified into three levels. First, new types of regulatory network are constructed using natural biological motifs or modules with known functions. The second is to synthesize genomic DNA and reconstruct the living body using de novo synthesis method. The third is the creation of a completely new biological system and even artificial life after the first two fields have been well developed. By several decades' development of synthetic biology, great progresses in fundamental science and practical applications have been achieved. Furthermore, new breakthroughs will be brought to the biotechnology in the foreseeable future. \n\nSynthetic biology covers various aspects, including genetic circuits, minimal genomes, DNA synthesis, and genetic modification [2]. And also, synthetic biology can be developed in organisms with reverse genetic tools and methodologies, including genetic transformation, selection markers, specific plasmid vectors, different promoters, and other advanced molecular biology techniques, such as (zinc finger proteins) ZFPs, (transcription activators like effector nucleases) TALENs, and (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) CRISPR [3,4]. To provide insight to further understand synthetic biology and discuss future perspectives in this area, the most updated techniques occurring in synthetic biology are summarized in this review.",

The aim is to artificially create biological systems of increasing size, complexity, and tailored functionality.

Synthetic biology involves the design and assembly of genetic circuits to create new biological functions. By understanding the native genetic circuits that are usually optimized via evolution and reconstructing them from modular design, bioengineers can use synthetic biology to build systems with novel activity. 4 In the early stage of synthetic biology, simple gene circuits could be built to be precisely executed to recapitulate patterns of certain natural biological systems in bacteria, such as oscillating gene expression networks, multistate toggle switches, logic computation, and intercellular signaling networks. 24,31,38 Following these early successes, significant progress has been made, such as new modular genetic parts with standardized design and connectivity principles to streamline the construction of novel circuits with greater complexity. 47,73 However, most of the early success of synthetic biology is performed in prokaryotic cells, while it remains difficult to directly transfer the methods into eukaryotic cells due to the complexity of the genetic networks. With the discovery of more precise genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, researchers have begun to interrogate and control gene function and network dynamics in eukaryotic cells. 75 CRISPR/ Cas9 allows precise targeting of specific genome loci.

Recent research has utilized tools and principles from synthetic biology to recreate natural developmental processes or engineer cell fate in precise ways.

Conventional modification of pre-existing cells is referred to as the top-down approach. Bottom-up synthetic biology is an emerging complementary branch that seeks to construct artificial cells from natural or synthetic components. One of the aims in bottom-up synthetic biology is to construct or mimic the complex pathways present in living cells. The recent, and rapidly growing, application of microfluidics in the field is driven by the central tenet of the bottom-up approach\u2014the pursuit of controllably generating artificial cells with precisely defined parameters, in terms of molecular and geometrical composition. In this review we survey conventional methods of artificial cell synthesis and their limitations. We proceed to show how microfluidic approaches have been pivotal in overcoming these limitations and ushering in a new generation of complexity that may be imbued in artificial cells and the milieu of applications that result.",

The success of doing so has paved way for the application of such technology in various fields such as basic research, medicine and industrial application. \n\nThanks to the advances in systems biology as well as the emergence of new powerful tools that allow scientists to synthesise and create DNA, we are no longer limited to physical DNA samples isolated from organisms [10][11][12]. The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells. \n\nDespite this progress, one of the biggest challenges that exists within this field is our incomplete knowledge of how life works and the true complexity of the cells and their interactions. Though there have been advances in the field of DNA sequencing and gene technologies, the basic toolkit for synthetic biology lies with molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. The assembly of a system with these molecules is often complex as it requires a large amount of genetic reprogramming, DNA and protein synthesis as well as functional screening. The lack of understanding coupled with the complexity of each of these components make it a challenge to mimic the true nature of any biological system with high fidelity. Another major challenge of this field is the reliability and robustness of new biological systems implemented within living organisms [13]. \n\nSynthetic biology however is still closely tied to living cells. Though with the advantage of being able to reproduce, the use of a living cell still brings about four major challenges in synthetic biology. This includes the difficulty to standardise, its complexity, incompatibility and variability [14,15]. Therefore, from the standpoint of synthetic biology, it is desirable for these challenges to be overcome using a set of standardised engineering solutions. An interdisciplinary approach that has been adopted to address this challenge is that of cell-free synthetic biology.",

An amalgamation of various fields, different experts have defined synthetic biology differently. However, at its core, synthetic biology centres at design, construction and characterisation of improved or novel biological systems [1]. \n\nMuch of the inspiration for the field is derived from the diversity and complexity of biological cells. Their complexity has paved way to allow for the design and modification of a system's functionality or the addition of a new function. Much of this field relies heavily upon an engineering-driven approach that accelerates the design-build-test loops required for reprogramming existing and constructing new systems [2]. One of the many unique capabilities of synthetic biology lies within this ability. \n\nThis advancement has seen synthetic biology to have broad applications not only in the medical, biofuel, chemicals and biomaterials field but also provides a revolutionary tool in the understanding of basic life sciences. Though synthetic biology is often rooted to its origins in genetic engineering, it is an umbrella term for a much wider field of its own. Genetic engineering in its own right is now a very mature field; however, much of the modern field synthetic biology is in its infancy using lesser understood and, arguably, unreliable methods [3]. \n\nThe first wave of synthetic biology focused upon the combination of basic elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and transcriptional repressors to form modules with specified behaviours. Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes [4,5]. Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches [6], pulse generators [7], oscillators [8] and digital logic gates [9]. These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation.",

Ces, A. Salehi-Reyhani\n## Abstract\nSynthetic biology is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary branch of science that exploits the advancement of molecular and cellular biology. Conventional modification of pre-existing cells is referred to as the top-down approach. Bottom-up synthetic biology is an emerging complementary branch that seeks to construct artificial cells from natural or synthetic components. One of the aims in bottom-up synthetic biology is to construct or mimic the complex pathways present in living cells. The recent, and rapidly growing, application of microfluidics in the field is driven by the central tenet of the bottom-up approach\u2014the pursuit of controllably generating artificial cells with precisely defined parameters, in terms of molecular and geometrical composition. In this review we survey conventional methods of artificial cell synthesis and their limitations. We proceed to show how microfluidic approaches have been pivotal in overcoming these limitations and ushering in a new generation of complexity that may be imbued in artificial cells and the milieu of applications that result.\n## Introduction\nSynthetic biology is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field bringing together several different disciplines which include genetic design and engineering, biology, nanotechnology, chemistry and physics. An amalgamation of various fields, different experts have defined synthetic biology differently. However, at its core, synthetic biology centres at design, construction and characterisation of improved or novel biological systems [1]. \n\nMuch of the inspiration for the field is derived from the diversity and complexity of biological cells. Their complexity has paved way to allow for the design and modification of a system's functionality or the addition of a new function. Much of this field relies heavily upon an engineering-driven approach that accelerates the design-build-test loops required for reprogramming existing and constructing new systems [2]. One of the many unique capabilities of synthetic biology lies within this ability. \n\nThis advancement has seen synthetic biology to have broad applications not only in the medical, biofuel, chemicals and biomaterials field but also provides a revolutionary tool in the understanding of basic life sciences. Though synthetic biology is often rooted to its origins in genetic engineering, it is an umbrella term for a much wider field of its own. Genetic engineering in its own right is now a very mature field; however, much of the modern field synthetic biology is in its infancy using lesser understood and, arguably, unreliable methods [3]. \n\nThe first wave of synthetic biology focused upon the combination of basic elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and transcriptional repressors to form modules with specified behaviours. Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes [4,5]. Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches [6], pulse generators [7], oscillators [8] and digital logic gates [9]. These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation.\n...\nThis allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation. The success of doing so has paved way for the application of such technology in various fields such as basic research, medicine and industrial application. \n\nThanks to the advances in systems biology as well as the emergence of new powerful tools that allow scientists to synthesise and create DNA, we are no longer limited to physical DNA samples isolated from organisms [10][11][12]. The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells. \n\nDespite this progress, one of the biggest challenges that exists within this field is our incomplete knowledge of how life works and the true complexity of the cells and their interactions. Though there have been advances in the field of DNA sequencing and gene technologies, the basic toolkit for synthetic biology lies with molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. The assembly of a system with these molecules is often complex as it requires a large amount of genetic reprogramming, DNA and protein synthesis as well as functional screening. The lack of understanding coupled with the complexity of each of these components make it a challenge to mimic the true nature of any biological system with high fidelity. Another major challenge of this field is the reliability and robustness of new biological systems implemented within living organisms [13]. \n\nSynthetic biology however is still closely tied to living cells. Though with the advantage of being able to reproduce, the use of a living cell still brings about four major challenges in synthetic biology. This includes the difficulty to standardise, its complexity, incompatibility and variability [14,15]. Therefore, from the standpoint of synthetic biology, it is desirable for these challenges to be overcome using a set of standardised engineering solutions. An interdisciplinary approach that has been adopted to address this challenge is that of cell-free synthetic biology.",

In this paper, we describe the first application of this powerful technology to the rapidly developing field of synthetic biology, for DNA synthesis and assembly at the nanoliter scale using a Labcyte Echo 550 acoustic dispenser. We were able to successfully downscale PCRs and the popular one-pot DNA assembly methods, Golden Gate and Gibson assemblies, from the microliter to the nanoliter scale with high assembly efficiency, which effectively cut the reagent cost by 20- to 100-fold. We envision that acoustic dispensing will become an instrumental technology in synthetic biology, in particular in the era of DNA foundries.",

Collectively, these technologies open up the possibility to redesign and resynthesize DNA at the genome scale. Poliovirus cDNA was synthesized without a natural template in 2002 by Cello et al. 14 Itaya's group pioneered the combination of two genomes in one cell in vivo. 15 The J. Craig Venter Institute chemically resynthesized a bacterial genome 16 and developed the genome transplantation technology to reboot the cell with the synthetic bacterial genome. 17 Together with several other groups across the world, our group is part of the international synthetic yeast consortium (www.syntheti cyeast.org), which aims to redesign and resynthesize the world's first eukaryotic genome.",

Rosser, Yizhi Cai\n## Abstract\nAcoustic droplet ejection (ADE) technology uses focused acoustic energy to transfer nanoliter-scale liquid droplets with high precision and accuracy. This noncontact, tipless, low-volume dispensing technology minimizes the possibility of cross-contamination and potentially reduces the costs of reagents and consumables. To date, acoustic dispensers have mainly been used in screening libraries of compounds. In this paper, we describe the first application of this powerful technology to the rapidly developing field of synthetic biology, for DNA synthesis and assembly at the nanoliter scale using a Labcyte Echo 550 acoustic dispenser. We were able to successfully downscale PCRs and the popular one-pot DNA assembly methods, Golden Gate and Gibson assemblies, from the microliter to the nanoliter scale with high assembly efficiency, which effectively cut the reagent cost by 20- to 100-fold. We envision that acoustic dispensing will become an instrumental technology in synthetic biology, in particular in the era of DNA foundries.\n## Introduction\nSynthetic biology is a nascent interdisciplinary research field that leverages rational design approaches based on engineering principles. 1,2 Synthetic biology distinguishes itself from traditional genetic engineering in several ways: (1) synthetic biology takes advantage of de novo DNA synthesis technologies, rather than relying on the existing natural templates; (2) synthetic biologists use standardized genetic parts not only to facilitate the assembly of novel sequences, but also to more predictably construct the biological system based on the characterization of individual parts 3 ; and (3) similar to other engineering disciplines, computer-assisted designers (CADs) and mathematical modeling are instrumental in synthetic biology to effectively help synthetic biologists navigate the design space. 4 lthough synthetic biology is still in an early stage, several breakthroughs in the past decade have already demonstrated its great potential for society; for instance, Keasling's group used a synthetic biology approach to engineer the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce artemisinin, an important antimalarial drug. 5 Lu and Collins engineered bacteriophage for an antibiotic therapy 6 and, more recently, also developed a paper-based cell-free methodology to rapidly detect Ebola viruses. 7 he enabling technology for synthetic biology is the development of a suite of advanced DNA synthesis and assembly methods, such as Golden Gate assembly, 8 Gibson assembly, 9 circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC), 10 transformation-assisted recombination (TAR) cloning, 11 and PaperClip assembly 12 (for a comprehensive review on DNA assembly methods, refer to Ellis et al. 13 ). Collectively, these technologies open up the possibility to redesign and resynthesize DNA at the genome scale. Poliovirus cDNA was synthesized without a natural template in 2002 by Cello et al. 14 Itaya's group pioneered the combination of two genomes in one cell in vivo. 15 The J. Craig Venter Institute chemically resynthesized a bacterial genome 16 and developed the genome transplantation technology to reboot the cell with the synthetic bacterial genome. 17 Together with several other groups across the world, our group is part of the international synthetic yeast consortium (www.syntheti cyeast.org), which aims to redesign and resynthesize the world's first eukaryotic genome.",

Surmounting the challenges en route to this ambitious objective will require answering several \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d design questions. Bottom-up questions relate to the parts and modules of the synthetic biological system as well as their characterization and assembly in isolation, whereas top-down questions focus on desirable and undesirable interactions between the synthetic system and its biological context.

This paper by Y. Zheng and G. Sriram provides detailed insights into mathematical modeling concepts and methodologies as relevant to synthetic biology. Any model is formulated on the basis of certain assumptions regarding the system under investigation as discussed by the authors. The paper introduces the two broad types of modeling frameworks: deterministic and stochastic modeling. The importance of parameter estimation and optimization in modeling is emphasized. In addition, mathematical techniques used to analyze a model such as sensitivity analysis and bifurcation analysis are presented. The authors discuss the role of modeling in phenotype analysis and conclude with three in-depth case studies about mathematical modeling in the framework of synthetic biology. \n \nThe second class of articles highlights examples and applications of synthetic biology for improved biofuels and biochemicals production. M. R. Connor and S. Atsumi review progress in improving microbial production of renewable liquid fuels and the unique role of synthetic biology in advancing these efforts. The fuel challenges facing society are first highlighted. They then provide an overview of research for the production of fermentative alcohols, nonfermentative higher alcohols, isoprenoids, and fatty acids. The importance of photosynthetic organisms in biofuels research is also discussed, and the reliance on synthetic biology tools to improve productivities and titers is emphasized. \n \nNext, L. R. Jarboe et al. review the combined use of synthetic biology tools with traditional metabolic engineering strategies for designing and improving microbial production of chemicals from renewable resources. They begin with an overview of technologies and tools available for biocatalyst redesign. They next describe strain engineering examples in which existing pathways were modified for the overproduction of various chemicals (e.g., succinate and D-lactate). These examples are contrasted with strain re-design via the introduction of foreign or nonnatural genes and pathways for production of compounds such as L-alanine and xylitol. The latter scenario includes the use of enzymes which have been engineered to have unnatural activities. \n \nFinally, G. H. McArthur IV and S. S. Fong focus in their paper on the impact of synthetic biology on engineering microbial metabolism. They discuss recent progress and current challenges in applying synthetic biology to metabolic engineering. In particular, the authors separately focus on each of the four workflow steps, design, modeling, synthesis, and analysis, and distinguish between parts (individual functional units) and pathways (part-based systems) for each single level. \n \nCollectively, these papers describe the current state of synthetic biology in the context of microbial biotechnology. Current and ongoing advances in this field will certainly propel our capacity to engineer improved microorganisms in the future. In this regard, these articles all provide prospective into the future of this field. \n \n \nHal Alper \n \nPatrick Cirino \n \nElke Nevoigt \n \nGanesh Sriram",

The importance of photosynthetic organisms in biofuels research is also discussed, and the reliance on synthetic biology tools to improve productivities and titers is emphasized. \n \nNext, L. R. Jarboe et al. review the combined use of synthetic biology tools with traditional metabolic engineering strategies for designing and improving microbial production of chemicals from renewable resources. They begin with an overview of technologies and tools available for biocatalyst redesign. They next describe strain engineering examples in which existing pathways were modified for the overproduction of various chemicals (e.g., succinate and D-lactate). These examples are contrasted with strain re-design via the introduction of foreign or nonnatural genes and pathways for production of compounds such as L-alanine and xylitol. The latter scenario includes the use of enzymes which have been engineered to have unnatural activities. \n \nFinally, G. H. McArthur IV and S. S. Fong focus in their paper on the impact of synthetic biology on engineering microbial metabolism. They discuss recent progress and current challenges in applying synthetic biology to metabolic engineering. In particular, the authors separately focus on each of the four workflow steps, design, modeling, synthesis, and analysis, and distinguish between parts (individual functional units) and pathways (part-based systems) for each single level. \n \nCollectively, these papers describe the current state of synthetic biology in the context of microbial biotechnology. Current and ongoing advances in this field will certainly propel our capacity to engineer improved microorganisms in the future. In this regard, these articles all provide prospective into the future of this field. \n \n \nHal Alper \n \nPatrick Cirino \n \nElke Nevoigt \n \nGanesh Sriram\n## body\nRecent advances in synthetic biology have greatly expanded the capacity to improve pathway performance and cellular phenotype. The design, use, and importation of constructed genetic control elements, optimized genes, and functional genetic circuits can be used to modulate the function of metabolic pathways. The modularity and hierarchy of parts, devices, systems, and chassis provide a framework for studying and controlling cellular functions. Moreover, synthetic biology provides an interface where protein engineering, directed evolution, DNA synthesis, and in silico design can direct the field of metabolic engineering. Many of these advances are influencing how scientists and engineers view and perturb cellular systems. Perhaps the paramount application of these tools is in the arena of microbial biotechnology where the overarching goal is to rewire cellular systems for biochemical production. This task is quite complex given the complexity and interconnectedness of metabolism and regulation. Synthetic biology approaches provide a way to both intervene in as well as bypass cellular complexities. \n\nThis special issue contains six review articles that highlight two major aspects of synthetic biology: (1) general design principles and modeling of synthetic biology and (2) applications of synthetic biology to biochemical and biofuels production. The articles are ordered based on these two areas. In the first class, review articles describe the basic paradigm of synthetic biology and include the design and modeling of systems. \n\nIn the first article, E. Young and H. Alper discuss the areas of synthetic biology within a process engineering paradigm, through a three-tiered model that uses the central dogma of biology as a pivot. The first tier comprises the units of the central dogma and the possible flows between them (DNA, transcription, RNA, translation, and protein), the second tier includes intrinsic interactions between these units by means of regulatory mechanisms, and the third tier comprises external or environmental influences on the units. This conceptualization permits engineering approaches in synthetic biology to be classified by which components they influence. The authors provide several examples to illustrate how synthetic biology approaches can be combined toward realizing the goal of integrative synthetic biology, which the authors exemplify with two examples from the literature. \n\nIn the second article, Fritz et al. discuss a \"biology by design\" paradigm, which involves the conceptualization, design, and construction of a synthetic biological system, followed by the expectation that the system will perform as desired.",

From this perspective, one way of summarizing synthetic biology is by its intended goal of making biological systems explicitly tractable through careful modularization of biology [1]. In this vein, the core emphases in synthetic biology are synthesis, abstraction, and standardization of biological components [2]. Synthesis refers to the generation of modular, reusable biological parts (normally as DNA). Abstraction refers to the implementation of synthesized parts by function rather than composition (e.g., \"this is a promoter\" rather than \"this is ttgacagctagctcagtcctaggtataatgctagc\") and can facilitate the design of more complex biological devices and systems. One of the hallmarks of this approach is the push for standardization where all synthesized parts and devices are characterized, reproducible, and interchangeable. \n\nAlthough nascent, the approach employed in synthetic biology is already making significant contributions in areas within biological engineering and basic biological research by providing a rigorous framework for building biological systems from the ground-up [3]. Progress in synthetic biology is providing the concepts and tools to develop biological engineering as an application of biology, just as chemical engineering is an application of chemistry. Although the scope of applied synthetic biology is wide, including areas that are \"beyond the bioreactor\" such as bioremediation, agriculture, and human health [4], it is apparent that many of the applications of synthetic biology that will materialize in the near future are in metabolic engineering [5]. In this context, the synthetic biology approach aims to generate scalable, reusable genetic parts for controlling genetically encoded unit operations (e.g., enzymes, transporters), for the predictable design and construction of metabolic pathways [6]. \n\nSince its inception, made possible by the advent of recombinant DNA technology and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the goal of metabolic engineering has been to optimize cellular metabolism for a particular process application-often through extensive genetic modification.",

Fong\n## Abstract\nThe generation of well-characterized parts and the formulation of biological design principles in synthetic biology are laying the foundation for more complex and advanced microbial metabolic engineering. Improvements in de novo DNA synthesis and codon-optimization alone are already contributing to the manufacturing of pathway enzymes with improved or novel function. Further development of analytical and computer-aided design tools should accelerate the forward engineering of precisely regulated synthetic pathways by providing a standard framework for the predictable design of biological systems from well-characterized parts. In this review we discuss the current state of synthetic biology within a four-stage framework (design, modeling, synthesis, analysis) and highlight areas requiring further advancement to facilitate true engineering of synthetic microbial metabolism.\n## Introduction\nAs with its sister field of systems biology, synthetic biology is perhaps best described not by what you do, but how you do it. From this perspective, one way of summarizing synthetic biology is by its intended goal of making biological systems explicitly tractable through careful modularization of biology [1]. In this vein, the core emphases in synthetic biology are synthesis, abstraction, and standardization of biological components [2]. Synthesis refers to the generation of modular, reusable biological parts (normally as DNA). Abstraction refers to the implementation of synthesized parts by function rather than composition (e.g., \"this is a promoter\" rather than \"this is ttgacagctagctcagtcctaggtataatgctagc\") and can facilitate the design of more complex biological devices and systems. One of the hallmarks of this approach is the push for standardization where all synthesized parts and devices are characterized, reproducible, and interchangeable. \n\nAlthough nascent, the approach employed in synthetic biology is already making significant contributions in areas within biological engineering and basic biological research by providing a rigorous framework for building biological systems from the ground-up [3]. Progress in synthetic biology is providing the concepts and tools to develop biological engineering as an application of biology, just as chemical engineering is an application of chemistry. Although the scope of applied synthetic biology is wide, including areas that are \"beyond the bioreactor\" such as bioremediation, agriculture, and human health [4], it is apparent that many of the applications of synthetic biology that will materialize in the near future are in metabolic engineering [5]. In this context, the synthetic biology approach aims to generate scalable, reusable genetic parts for controlling genetically encoded unit operations (e.g., enzymes, transporters), for the predictable design and construction of metabolic pathways [6]. \n\nSince its inception, made possible by the advent of recombinant DNA technology and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the goal of metabolic engineering has been to optimize cellular metabolism for a particular process application-often through extensive genetic modification.",

In a process engineering paradigm, each biological process stream and process unit is heavily influenced by regulatory interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Synthetic biology is developing the tools and methods that will increase control over these interactions, eventually resulting in an integrative synthetic biology that will allow ground-up cellular optimization. In this review, we attempt to contextualize the areas of synthetic biology into three tiers: (1) the process units and associated streams of the central dogma, (2) the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, and (3) the extrinsic physical and chemical environment. Efforts at each of these three tiers attempt to control cellular systems and take advantage of emerging tools and approaches. Ultimately, it will be possible to integrate these approaches and realize the vision of integrative synthetic biology when cells are completely rewired for biotechnological goals. This review will highlight progress towards this goal as well as areas requiring further research.",

These manipulations are made possible through detailed knowledge of the central dogma process. While this capacity has existed for several decades [34], novel capabilities and genetic tools afforded by synthetic biology may help overcome some of the limitations and time-consuming bottlenecks inherent in established techniques. In this regard, synthetic biology aims to develop foundational technologies such as large-scale, economical de novo DNA synthesis [35] that would increase the efficiency of traditional recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. Collectively, synthetic engineering of the central dogma aims to optimize and expand the capabilities of native cellular machinery. The methods and technologies developed from this research will contribute to a more powerful and efficient toolbox for the microbial engineer. \n\nIn this section, we will review synthetic biology technologies and applications for influencing components within the first tier. \n\n2.1. Engineering DNA. DNA manipulation began very early in the biotechnological revolution with recombinant DNA methods [36][37][38] and DNA sequencing technology [39][40][41]. Mutagenesis techniques and the establishment of standardized molecular biology methods [34] expanded these tools and empowered metabolic engineers with more powerful approaches to improve metabolic phenotypes [42][43][44][45][46]. Despite being straightforward and robust, these approaches are inherently limited by template-based DNA synthesis and restriction enzyme cloning. However, inexpensive, large scale synthetic (de novo) DNA manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize this process once again. Unlike traditional methods, de novo synthesis removes the need to engineer cellular systems using preexisting DNA as a template. In this regard, this technology brings about a new power to synthetically design genes, control elements, and circuits that do not exist in nature-thus creating novel function from the basic building blocks of nucleic acids and amino acids. Already, there are multiple companies with expertise in synthesizing DNA (Blue Heron, DNA2.0, GENEART, IDT, etc.), from small fragments to whole genes and genetic elements.",

Young, H. Alper\n## Abstract\nThe general central dogma frames the emergent properties of life, which make biology both necessary and difficult to engineer. In a process engineering paradigm, each biological process stream and process unit is heavily influenced by regulatory interactions and interactions with the surrounding environment. Synthetic biology is developing the tools and methods that will increase control over these interactions, eventually resulting in an integrative synthetic biology that will allow ground-up cellular optimization. In this review, we attempt to contextualize the areas of synthetic biology into three tiers: (1) the process units and associated streams of the central dogma, (2) the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, and (3) the extrinsic physical and chemical environment. Efforts at each of these three tiers attempt to control cellular systems and take advantage of emerging tools and approaches. Ultimately, it will be possible to integrate these approaches and realize the vision of integrative synthetic biology when cells are completely rewired for biotechnological goals. This review will highlight progress towards this goal as well as areas requiring further research.\n## The First Tier-Process Optimization of the Central Dogma\nThe first tier of synthetic biology focuses on altering the general process flow-specifically modifications to the function and behavior of the process units (transcription [32] and translation) and the associated process streams (DNA, RNA [33], and protein). These manipulations are made possible through detailed knowledge of the central dogma process. While this capacity has existed for several decades [34], novel capabilities and genetic tools afforded by synthetic biology may help overcome some of the limitations and time-consuming bottlenecks inherent in established techniques. In this regard, synthetic biology aims to develop foundational technologies such as large-scale, economical de novo DNA synthesis [35] that would increase the efficiency of traditional recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. Collectively, synthetic engineering of the central dogma aims to optimize and expand the capabilities of native cellular machinery. The methods and technologies developed from this research will contribute to a more powerful and efficient toolbox for the microbial engineer. \n\nIn this section, we will review synthetic biology technologies and applications for influencing components within the first tier. \n\n2.1. Engineering DNA. DNA manipulation began very early in the biotechnological revolution with recombinant DNA methods [36][37][38] and DNA sequencing technology [39][40][41]. Mutagenesis techniques and the establishment of standardized molecular biology methods [34] expanded these tools and empowered metabolic engineers with more powerful approaches to improve metabolic phenotypes [42][43][44][45][46]. Despite being straightforward and robust, these approaches are inherently limited by template-based DNA synthesis and restriction enzyme cloning. However, inexpensive, large scale synthetic (de novo) DNA manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize this process once again. Unlike traditional methods, de novo synthesis removes the need to engineer cellular systems using preexisting DNA as a template. In this regard, this technology brings about a new power to synthetically design genes, control elements, and circuits that do not exist in nature-thus creating novel function from the basic building blocks of nucleic acids and amino acids. Already, there are multiple companies with expertise in synthesizing DNA (Blue Heron, DNA2.0, GENEART, IDT, etc.), from small fragments to whole genes and genetic elements.",

For example, it is possible to analyse with significant accuracy the flight characteristics of a new aeroplane before construction has begun. At its most ambitious, synthetic biology aims to enable this for living organisms. By applying the engineering cycle of design-test-build-learn and founding principles such as standardization, automation and abstraction, synthetic biology aims to increase both the scale and predictability of biotechnology. \n\nThe phenotype of every living organism is dictated by a combination of the genes coded among the billions of nucleotide bases in DNA and the environment in which that organism lives. While genomics and metabolomics have enabled the identification of genes coding for enzymes responsible for biosynthesis, transferring these genes into new hosts requires regulatory elements that produce the correct quantities of each gene at the correct time. It also requires that proteins fold and function properly, that suitable quantities of metabolic precursors are available, and that the intermediates and end-products of the new metabolic pathways are not destroyed or used to make alternate products by the host cell. \n\nWe can now read, write and edit DNA with increasing fluency, facilitating the engineering cycle. Standardized DNA parts encoding regulatory elements can be designed and rapidly assembled in multiple combinations with enzymes that catalyse existing precursors into new compounds. These high-performance pathways can then be introduced to cells. In addition, genome engineering tools such as those derived from bacteria CRISPR/Cas9 systems can be used to remove genes from the host that encode products that use or break down the products of the new pathway. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the application of quantitative modelling is starting to inform how the design of new DNA and protein sequences inserted into host cells will influence their interactions with each other and with molecules present in the host to affect yield.",

Bickerton\n## Abstract\nSynthetic biology applies the principles of engineering to biology, helping us to design, redesign and build novel biological systems. First applied to microorganisms it has enabled the industrialscale production of beneficial, bio-based products such as pharmaceuticals, flavourings and textiles. It is now advancing to multicellular organisms. In plants, the field is still in its infancy, yet the potential for plants as light-powered, sustainable biomanufacturing platforms is tremendous.\n## Synthetic biology: application of design-build-test-learn\nContemporary engineering enables computer-based design and accurate prediction of behaviour before any structure is built. For example, it is possible to analyse with significant accuracy the flight characteristics of a new aeroplane before construction has begun. At its most ambitious, synthetic biology aims to enable this for living organisms. By applying the engineering cycle of design-test-build-learn and founding principles such as standardization, automation and abstraction, synthetic biology aims to increase both the scale and predictability of biotechnology. \n\nThe phenotype of every living organism is dictated by a combination of the genes coded among the billions of nucleotide bases in DNA and the environment in which that organism lives. While genomics and metabolomics have enabled the identification of genes coding for enzymes responsible for biosynthesis, transferring these genes into new hosts requires regulatory elements that produce the correct quantities of each gene at the correct time. It also requires that proteins fold and function properly, that suitable quantities of metabolic precursors are available, and that the intermediates and end-products of the new metabolic pathways are not destroyed or used to make alternate products by the host cell. \n\nWe can now read, write and edit DNA with increasing fluency, facilitating the engineering cycle. Standardized DNA parts encoding regulatory elements can be designed and rapidly assembled in multiple combinations with enzymes that catalyse existing precursors into new compounds. These high-performance pathways can then be introduced to cells. In addition, genome engineering tools such as those derived from bacteria CRISPR/Cas9 systems can be used to remove genes from the host that encode products that use or break down the products of the new pathway. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the application of quantitative modelling is starting to inform how the design of new DNA and protein sequences inserted into host cells will influence their interactions with each other and with molecules present in the host to affect yield.",

We also successfully used the resulting vectors to assemble and propagate other BioBrick standard biological parts.ConclusionWe extended the principles of part reuse and standardization to BioBrick vectors. As a result, myriad new BioBrick vectors can be readily produced from all existing and newly designed BioBrick parts. We invite the synthetic biology community to (1) use the process to make and share new BioBrick vectors; (2) expand the current collection of BioBrick vector parts; and (3) characterize and improve the available collection of BioBrick vector parts.\n",

One of the goals is to have the capacity to design and build synthetic cells with predictable functions and applications, including the production of biocommodities, therapeutic treatment and biosensors [88,89]. Indeed, recent reviews of synthetic biology have highlighted artificial cells as promising synthetic systems [88,89]. The field approaches biological engineering from several unique angles. First, synthetic biology highlights design principles that can guide the control of biological systems [90,91]. Rational design is a mainstay of synthetic biology that relies on the idea that biological systems are fundamentally modular [54,92]. During the design process, genes are defined as the basic biological units. The aim of rational design is to generate an optimized outcome through logical assembly of these basic units. For example, the synthesis of the precursor of the anti-malaria drug, artemisinic acid was achieved by coupling an engineered mevalonate pathway with two enzymes (amorphadiene synthase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) in yeast [93]. \n\nSecond, synthetic biologists use well-characterized and interoperable modules, such as promoters, operators, transcriptional factors and ribosome binding sites, as building blocks to create higher-order circuits [53,[94][95][96][97].

The repression strength was less strong when located in the proximal region and was the weakest when located in the distal region. Conversely, activators worked only in the distal region and had no effect in the core and proximal regions [99]. These basic principles could be exploited to assemble promoter modules in a bottom-up approach. \n\nThird, synthetic biology uses a bottom-up approach to understand biological circuits.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Synthetic biology conceptualizes biological complexity as a network of biological parts, devices, and systems with predetermined functionalities and has had a revolutionary impact on fundamental and applied research. With the unprecedented ability to synthesize and transfer any DNA and RNA across organisms, the scope of synthetic biology is expanding and being recreated in previously unimaginable ways. The field has matured to a level where highly complex networks, such as artificial communities of synthetic organisms, can be constructed. In parallel, computational biology became an integral part of biological studies, with computational models aiding the unravelling of the escalating complexity and emerging properties of biological phenomena. However, there is still a vast untapped potential for the complete integration of modelling into the synthetic design process, presenting exciting opportunities for scientific advancements. Here, we first highlight the most recent advances in computer-aided design of microbial communities. Next, we propose that such a design can benefit from an organism-free modular modelling approach that places its emphasis on modules of organismal function towards the design of multispecies communities. We argue for a shift in perspective from single organism\u2013centred approaches to emphasizing the functional contributions of organisms within the community. By assembling synthetic biological systems using modular computational models with mathematical descriptions of parts and circuits, we can tailor organisms to fulfil specific functional roles within the community. This approach aligns with synthetic biology strategies and presents exciting possibilities for the design of artificial communities. Graphical Abstract",

                    "text": "Synthetic biology is now a mature field of research with an established record of newly developed biological molecular tools, devices, and cellular structural and functional modules. A core tenet of synthetic biology is that biological systems can exhibit the emergence of highly complex behaviours by virtue of the interconnection between simple 'modules' (e.g. DNA regulatory elements, and protein domains) that exhibit robust, well-defined functions regardless of the organismal context in which they are contained. Synthetic biology principles have found relevance and have been applied in the research design for a wide range of topics from fundamental to biotechnological, providing promising solutions to global challenges [5,6]. \n\nThe construction of the first synthetic circuits at the 'dawn' of synthetic biology was highly reliant on breaking genetic control systems down into definable parts and then collecting and using existing quantitative data that were most important for the function of these parts when used in different contexts [7,8]. While earlier engineering was, in part, restrained by technical limitations on what could be cloned, this restriction has largely evaporated in recent years. Improved DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have laid the groundwork for designing increasingly complex systems, such as biocellular and cell-free multipurpose metabolic factories, and the design of synthetic protocells and xenobiological systems [9][10][11]. Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial [13] and eukaryotic cells [14]. \n\nOne example of recombining large functional modules is the design of multispecies synthetic microbial communities: where individual microbial strains may be of natural origin or genetically engineered to conduct desired functions [15]. Still, many current applications in the literature were achieved by following a more handcrafted and intuitive type of approach, rather than following the whole engineering cycle and utilizing a quantitative approach.",

Axmann\n## Abstract\nAbstract Synthetic biology conceptualizes biological complexity as a network of biological parts, devices, and systems with predetermined functionalities and has had a revolutionary impact on fundamental and applied research. With the unprecedented ability to synthesize and transfer any DNA and RNA across organisms, the scope of synthetic biology is expanding and being recreated in previously unimaginable ways. The field has matured to a level where highly complex networks, such as artificial communities of synthetic organisms, can be constructed. In parallel, computational biology became an integral part of biological studies, with computational models aiding the unravelling of the escalating complexity and emerging properties of biological phenomena. However, there is still a vast untapped potential for the complete integration of modelling into the synthetic design process, presenting exciting opportunities for scientific advancements. Here, we first highlight the most recent advances in computer-aided design of microbial communities. Next, we propose that such a design can benefit from an organism-free modular modelling approach that places its emphasis on modules of organismal function towards the design of multispecies communities. We argue for a shift in perspective from single organism\u2013centred approaches to emphasizing the functional contributions of organisms within the community. By assembling synthetic biological systems using modular computational models with mathematical descriptions of parts and circuits, we can tailor organisms to fulfil specific functional roles within the community. This approach aligns with synthetic biology strategies and presents exciting possibilities for the design of artificial communities. Graphical Abstract\n## From synthetic parts towards communities\nSynthetic biology is now a mature field of research with an established record of newly developed biological molecular tools, devices, and cellular structural and functional modules. A core tenet of synthetic biology is that biological systems can exhibit the emergence of highly complex behaviours by virtue of the interconnection between simple 'modules' (e.g. DNA regulatory elements, and protein domains) that exhibit robust, well-defined functions regardless of the organismal context in which they are contained. Synthetic biology principles have found relevance and have been applied in the research design for a wide range of topics from fundamental to biotechnological, providing promising solutions to global challenges [5,6]. \n\nThe construction of the first synthetic circuits at the 'dawn' of synthetic biology was highly reliant on breaking genetic control systems down into definable parts and then collecting and using existing quantitative data that were most important for the function of these parts when used in different contexts [7,8]. While earlier engineering was, in part, restrained by technical limitations on what could be cloned, this restriction has largely evaporated in recent years. Improved DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have laid the groundwork for designing increasingly complex systems, such as biocellular and cell-free multipurpose metabolic factories, and the design of synthetic protocells and xenobiological systems [9][10][11]. Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial [13] and eukaryotic cells [14]. \n\nOne example of recombining large functional modules is the design of multispecies synthetic microbial communities: where individual microbial strains may be of natural origin or genetically engineered to conduct desired functions [15]. Still, many current applications in the literature were achieved by following a more handcrafted and intuitive type of approach, rather than following the whole engineering cycle and utilizing a quantitative approach.",

However, historical treatment options are continuously updated and reimagined in the context of novel technical developments, such as those facilitated through the application of synthetic biology. When it comes to the development of genetic forms of therapies and vaccines, synthetic biology offers diverse tools and approaches to influence the content, dosage, and breadth of treatment with the prospect of economic advantage provided in time and cost benefits. This can be achieved by utilizing the broad tools within this discipline to enhance the functionality and efficacy of pharmaceutical agent sequences. This review will describe how synthetic biology principles can augment RNA-based treatments through optimizing not only the vaccine antigen, therapeutic construct, therapeutic activity, and delivery vector.

Moreover, the modular components within this catalog can be assembled and tested to identify combinations that yield further advantages beyond each individually. One such modular component, a genetic toggle switch, was engineered into Escherichia coli in the early 2000's 8 , which resulted in the creation of the first synthetic biological system 8 . This breakthrough paved the way for further advances such as bacteria that produce biofuels or cells programmed to target cancer cells. \n\nIn the past, synthetic biologists have primarily used DNA as the molecule of choice for designing synthetic systems. As a result, synthetic DNA had been instrumental in the development of artificial genes 9 , gene regulatory networks 10 , and even entire genomes 11,12 , enabling scientists to study complex biological processes and even create synthetic organisms 2,13 . However, with the rise of RNA therapeutics, there has been a growing interest in developing synthetic systems exploiting the unique attributes of RNA molecules. RNA is more than just a messenger-it has a direct role in regulating cellular behavior and, in the past few years, large libraries of RNA parts affecting almost every step of biological control have become available 14 . RNA-based systems constructed using these libraries are safer than those constructed from DNA as they do not integrate into the host genome, making them suitable for therapeutic applications with higher safety standards 15 . Unlike DNA-based systems, RNA-based systems, built from RNA devices and circuits, are fast-acting as they do not require transcription 16 . Using diverse libraries of RNA components, researchers have begun to generate RNA-based systems that couple environmental sensing with functional outputs for therapeutic synthetic biology applications 17,18 . \n\nThe recent success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has sparked a surge in interest in RNA therapeutic technology and how the field of synthetic biology can be employed. Particularly, there are some challenges associated with RNA technology which can be addressed using synthetic biology. For example, base modifications and mRNA circularization have been employed to reduce mRNA immunogenicity and improve mRNA's lifespan respectively.",

However, they often fall short when addressing complex diseases or diseases with genetic roots. Additionally, the cost and extended development timelines associated with these approaches have the potential to limit their application to emergent diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Synthetic biology, a field that has already had a significant impact on the agricultural, environmental, and renewable biofuel industries 2 , has emerged as an attractive alternative drug development approach. \n\nSynthetic biology is a scientific field that involves the rewiring of organisms or biomolecular parts for new and desired abilities.

Pfeifer, M. Beitelshees, A. Hill, Justin Bassett, Charles H. Jones\n## Abstract\nRecent global events have drawn into focus the diversity of options for combatting disease across a spectrum of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. The recent success of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has paved the way for RNA-based treatments to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. However, historical treatment options are continuously updated and reimagined in the context of novel technical developments, such as those facilitated through the application of synthetic biology. When it comes to the development of genetic forms of therapies and vaccines, synthetic biology offers diverse tools and approaches to influence the content, dosage, and breadth of treatment with the prospect of economic advantage provided in time and cost benefits. This can be achieved by utilizing the broad tools within this discipline to enhance the functionality and efficacy of pharmaceutical agent sequences. This review will describe how synthetic biology principles can augment RNA-based treatments through optimizing not only the vaccine antigen, therapeutic construct, therapeutic activity, and delivery vector. The enhancement of RNA vaccine technology through implementing synthetic biology has the potential to shape the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe pharmaceutical industry has long depended on synthetic chemistry approaches to develop novel therapeutics. These approaches, which have led to numerous breakthroughs in drug development, have typically relied on screening compound libraries populated by a range of molecules derived from a set of known and robust chemistry reactions in order to achieve improved efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties 1 . However, they often fall short when addressing complex diseases or diseases with genetic roots. Additionally, the cost and extended development timelines associated with these approaches have the potential to limit their application to emergent diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Synthetic biology, a field that has already had a significant impact on the agricultural, environmental, and renewable biofuel industries 2 , has emerged as an attractive alternative drug development approach. \n\nSynthetic biology is a scientific field that involves the rewiring of organisms or biomolecular parts for new and desired abilities. This encompasses diverse applications, from engineering new or improved activities in enzymes, heterologous production of commodity chemicals, assembly of genetic parts in a synthetic manner and developing cellular therapies.

Moreover, the modular components within this catalog can be assembled and tested to identify combinations that yield further advantages beyond each individually. One such modular component, a genetic toggle switch, was engineered into Escherichia coli in the early 2000's 8 , which resulted in the creation of the first synthetic biological system 8 . This breakthrough paved the way for further advances such as bacteria that produce biofuels or cells programmed to target cancer cells. \n\nIn the past, synthetic biologists have primarily used DNA as the molecule of choice for designing synthetic systems. As a result, synthetic DNA had been instrumental in the development of artificial genes 9 , gene regulatory networks 10 , and even entire genomes 11,12 , enabling scientists to study complex biological processes and even create synthetic organisms 2,13 . However, with the rise of RNA therapeutics, there has been a growing interest in developing synthetic systems exploiting the unique attributes of RNA molecules. RNA is more than just a messenger-it has a direct role in regulating cellular behavior and, in the past few years, large libraries of RNA parts affecting almost every step of biological control have become available 14 . RNA-based systems constructed using these libraries are safer than those constructed from DNA as they do not integrate into the host genome, making them suitable for therapeutic applications with higher safety standards 15 . Unlike DNA-based systems, RNA-based systems, built from RNA devices and circuits, are fast-acting as they do not require transcription 16 . Using diverse libraries of RNA components, researchers have begun to generate RNA-based systems that couple environmental sensing with functional outputs for therapeutic synthetic biology applications 17,18 . \n\nThe recent success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has sparked a surge in interest in RNA therapeutic technology and how the field of synthetic biology can be employed. Particularly, there are some challenges associated with RNA technology which can be addressed using synthetic biology. For example, base modifications and mRNA circularization have been employed to reduce mRNA immunogenicity and improve mRNA's lifespan respectively.",

The term \u201cSB\u201d can be traced back to 1912 to Stephane Leduc\u2019s book La Biologie Synthetique. The next direct reference to the term is found in 1974 when Waclaw Szybalski, in only a few sentences, laid the foundations for the emerging field of SB. The new wave of SB aims to design and engineer biologically based parts, novel devices, and networks as well as redesigning existing, natural biological pathways. Hence, SB has the potential to deliver significant technological benefits and economic growth. \n \nSynthetic biology has already made a resounding impact in fundamental and applied research. Currently it has broad applications in a number of areas including medicine, the environment and energy, agriculture, and food industries. Selected milestones and significant achievements include the reconstruction of a complete microbial genome (Gibson et al., 2010), the synthesis of a yeast chromosome (Dymond et al., 2011), and most recently, the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high levels of a key precursor of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Paddon et al., 2013). \n \nSynthetic Biology: Tools and Applications, edited by Huimin Zhao (University of Illinois) provides a comprehensive coverage and a succinct overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge on SB (Zhao, 2013). The overall scope of the book is based on a review article (Zhao, 2013) published in Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine (Liang et al., 2011). On more than 300 pages, structured into 17 chapters, Synthetic Biology: Tools and Applications brings together thought leaders and leading researchers in SB, by providing a systematic and integrated framework to examine key enabling components in SB. \n \nThe era of SB has arrived. As tellingly described in the introduction by the editor, SB builds on the advances in molecular, and systems biology and seeks to revolutionize life sciences in the same way that chemical synthesis revolutionized chemistry and integrated circuit design revolutionized computing. In addition, the number of publications on SB has increased exponentially in recent years. As a consequence, it is almost impossible to follow the rush of SB-literature in detail. Furthermore, the emergence of SB has been accompanied by the development of new and improved experimental tools and approaches. However, more exciting applications in basic and applied research would be useful to make SB easier, safer, and more predictable. Therefore, it is sound and timely to collect and converge the various research tools, methodologies, and prospects of SB research in a single comprehensive book. \n \nThe organization of the book into four well-chosen sections (rather than into 17 imposing chapters) lures the reader into reading a thematic section of several chapters at any one time, rather than the entire book. The order of topics is intended to represent a logical progression. Each chapter starts with an essential introduction; this allows reading the chapters independently from each other, a feature that readers will highly acknowledge. \n \nThe first thematic section, entitled \u201cSynthesis and Engineering Tools in SB.\u201d This section (chapters 1\u20134) addresses the latest state-of-the-art experimental tools and approaches developed for engineering biological systems at molecular, cellular, and multi-cellular levels. In addition, this section discusses the technologies for DNA synthesis and their limitations, whereas it also provides an overview of the key methods for protein engineering. The section closes by describing the challenges and opportunities in the standardization and modularization of biological parts, which is one of the key distinguishing features of SB. The second thematic section (chapters 5\u20138) reviews the mathematical modeling approaches, and in silico tools, which can dramatically accelerate the design process, as well as reduce the cost of development of novel devices and networks. In addition, this section introduces a new computational SB tool, the Synthetic Biology Software Suite, whereas a wide variety of successful examples are also discussed to highlight the effectiveness of these computational tools and approaches. The next section (chapters 9\u201313) deals with exciting practical applications of SB. Chapters of this section provide an overview on the potential therapeutic applications of SB on human health and disease, and on microbial production of pharmaceuticals. In addition, this section discusses the industrial application of SB in the microbial production of biofuels, and the challenges associated with biofuels production on an industrial scale. Furthermore, the available technologies and strategies for designing and constructing bacterial genomes, and the recent efforts on the analysis and creation of microbial consortia are also overviewed elegantly. The final section (chapters 14\u201317), Future Prospects, describes the current status of designing and constructing synthetic or artificial cells. This section also provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in cell-free SB. Furthermore, it provides an overview on the use of several tools to engineer light-energy conversion and carbon fixation in diverse non-photosynthetic hosts. Moreover, the recent developments and future prospects in engineering synthetic microbial ecosystems are also described. Finally, although an index is present, a glossary would be desirable. \n \nSynthetic Biology: Tools and Applications uses a combination of elegant tables, figures, and graphs to present complicated information in a way that is accessible and understandable by the reader. All chapters are skillfully reviewed and highly citable. In summary, the book is an excellent addition to the current literature on SB. It is a perfect companion for policy makers and funding agencies. Lastly, but most importantly, Synthetic Biology: Tools and Applications will be greatly appreciated by geneticists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, physicists, chemists, and bioengineers, and those contemplating a future in SB.",

Matsoukas\n## Abstract\nSynthetic biology (SB) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The term \u201cSB\u201d can be traced back to 1912 to Stephane Leduc\u2019s book La Biologie Synthetique. The next direct reference to the term is found in 1974 when Waclaw Szybalski, in only a few sentences, laid the foundations for the emerging field of SB. The new wave of SB aims to design and engineer biologically based parts, novel devices, and networks as well as redesigning existing, natural biological pathways. Hence, SB has the potential to deliver significant technological benefits and economic growth. \n \nSynthetic biology has already made a resounding impact in fundamental and applied research. Currently it has broad applications in a number of areas including medicine, the environment and energy, agriculture, and food industries. Selected milestones and significant achievements include the reconstruction of a complete microbial genome (Gibson et al., 2010), the synthesis of a yeast chromosome (Dymond et al., 2011), and most recently, the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high levels of a key precursor of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Paddon et al., 2013). \n \nSynthetic Biology: Tools and Applications, edited by Huimin Zhao (University of Illinois) provides a comprehensive coverage and a succinct overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge on SB (Zhao, 2013). The overall scope of the book is based on a review article (Zhao, 2013) published in Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine (Liang et al., 2011). On more than 300 pages, structured into 17 chapters, Synthetic Biology: Tools and Applications brings together thought leaders and leading researchers in SB, by providing a systematic and integrated framework to examine key enabling components in SB. \n \nThe era of SB has arrived. As tellingly described in the introduction by the editor, SB builds on the advances in molecular, and systems biology and seeks to revolutionize life sciences in the same way that chemical synthesis revolutionized chemistry and integrated circuit design revolutionized computing. In addition, the number of publications on SB has increased exponentially in recent years. As a consequence, it is almost impossible to follow the rush of SB-literature in detail. Furthermore, the emergence of SB has been accompanied by the development of new and improved experimental tools and approaches. However, more exciting applications in basic and applied research would be useful to make SB easier, safer, and more predictable. Therefore, it is sound and timely to collect and converge the various research tools, methodologies, and prospects of SB research in a single comprehensive book. \n \nThe organization of the book into four well-chosen sections (rather than into 17 imposing chapters) lures the reader into reading a thematic section of several chapters at any one time, rather than the entire book. The order of topics is intended to represent a logical progression. Each chapter starts with an essential introduction; this allows reading the chapters independently from each other, a feature that readers will highly acknowledge. \n \nThe first thematic section, entitled \u201cSynthesis and Engineering Tools in SB.\u201d This section (chapters 1\u20134) addresses the latest state-of-the-art experimental tools and approaches developed for engineering biological systems at molecular, cellular, and multi-cellular levels. In addition, this section discusses the technologies for DNA synthesis and their limitations, whereas it also provides an overview of the key methods for protein engineering. The section closes by describing the challenges and opportunities in the standardization and modularization of biological parts, which is one of the key distinguishing features of SB. The second thematic section (chapters 5\u20138) reviews the mathematical modeling approaches, and in silico tools, which can dramatically accelerate the design process, as well as reduce the cost of development of novel devices and networks. In addition, this section introduces a new computational SB tool, the Synthetic Biology Software Suite, whereas a wide variety of successful examples are also discussed to highlight the effectiveness of these computational tools and approaches. The next section (chapters 9\u201313) deals with exciting practical applications of SB. Chapters of this section provide an overview on the potential therapeutic applications of SB on human health and disease, and on microbial production of pharmaceuticals. In addition, this section discusses the industrial application of SB in the microbial production of biofuels, and the challenges associated with biofuels production on an industrial scale. Furthermore, the available technologies and strategies for designing and constructing bacterial genomes, and the recent efforts on the analysis and creation of microbial consortia are also overviewed elegantly. The final section (chapters 14\u201317), Future Prospects, describes the current status of designing and constructing synthetic or artificial cells. This section also provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in cell-free SB. Furthermore, it provides an overview on the use of several tools to engineer light-energy conversion and carbon fixation in diverse non-photosynthetic hosts. Moreover, the recent developments and future prospects in engineering synthetic microbial ecosystems are also described. Finally, although an index is present, a glossary would be desirable. \n \nSynthetic Biology: Tools and Applications uses a combination of elegant tables, figures, and graphs to present complicated information in a way that is accessible and understandable by the reader. All chapters are skillfully reviewed and highly citable. In summary, the book is an excellent addition to the current literature on SB. It is a perfect companion for policy makers and funding agencies. Lastly, but most importantly, Synthetic Biology: Tools and Applications will be greatly appreciated by geneticists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, physicists, chemists, and bioengineers, and those contemplating a future in SB.\n",

It plays a pivotal role in microbial engineering by enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and functionality of microorganisms for pharmaceutical applications. The ability to redesign gene expression to create minimal-genome microorganisms with novel traits or custom genetic circuits offers promising solutions for pharmaceutical applications, bioremediation, and biofuel production [63,64]. \n\nThe robust theoretical foundation of synthetic biology enables researchers to integrate protein engineering, DNA synthesis, and in silico design methods to construct metabolic pathways and biological circuits that control cellular processes. These technologies not only improve communication systems between microorganisms but also expand their functionality through intercellular signaling and cooperative microbial networks [65]. \n\nA key aspect of synthetic biology is the availability of modular toolboxes that provide standardized genetic elements to control and optimize gene expression. These toolboxes include various types of promoters (constitutive and inducible), ribosome binding sites (RBSs) for translational efficiency, riboswitches that enable the dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to specific metabolites, and terminators ensuring proper transcriptional control. Additionally, synthetic biology toolkits often incorporate modular operons, genetic logic gates, and regulatory circuits that allow the precise manipulation of microbial metabolism. These elements are crucial for fine-tuning biosynthetic pathways and optimizing microbial production systems in pharmaceutical applications [66]. \n\nThrough the development of genetic platforms and control systems, synthetic biology has transformed microorganisms into tools for diagnosing diseases and precisely delivering therapeutic molecules. Engineered microbes have been successfully applied in biosensors and diagnostic platforms, enabling the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens and disease markers [67]. Engineered microbes overcome the limitations of traditional therapies by delivering therapeutic molecules in targeted, localized doses, minimizing side effects while maintaining efficacy. For example, microorganisms like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, capable of surviving in the human gut for extended periods, can be reprogrammed for the long-term monitoring and treatment of chronic diseases.",

Belkozhayev\n## Abstract\nMicrobial engineering has made a significant breakthrough in pharmaceutical biotechnology, greatly expanding the production of biologically active compounds, therapeutic proteins, and novel drug candidates. Recent advancements in genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and adaptive evolution have contributed to the optimization of microbial strains for pharmaceutical applications, playing a crucial role in enhancing their productivity and stability. The CRISPR-Cas system is widely utilized as a precise genome modification tool, enabling the enhancement of metabolite biosynthesis and the activation of synthetic biological pathways. Additionally, synthetic biology approaches allow for the targeted design of microorganisms with improved metabolic efficiency and therapeutic potential, thereby accelerating the development of new pharmaceutical products. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) plays a vital role in further advancing microbial engineering by predicting metabolic network interactions, optimizing bioprocesses, and accelerating the drug discovery process. However, challenges such as the efficient optimization of metabolic pathways, ensuring sustainable industrial-scale production, and meeting international regulatory requirements remain critical barriers in the field. Furthermore, to mitigate potential risks, it is essential to develop stringent biocontainment strategies and implement appropriate regulatory oversight. This review comprehensively examines recent innovations in microbial engineering, analyzing key technological advancements, regulatory challenges, and future development perspectives.\n## Synthetic Biology\nSynthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that integrates the principles of engineering and biology to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems, or to reprogram existing ones [62]. It plays a pivotal role in microbial engineering by enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and functionality of microorganisms for pharmaceutical applications. The ability to redesign gene expression to create minimal-genome microorganisms with novel traits or custom genetic circuits offers promising solutions for pharmaceutical applications, bioremediation, and biofuel production [63,64]. \n\nThe robust theoretical foundation of synthetic biology enables researchers to integrate protein engineering, DNA synthesis, and in silico design methods to construct metabolic pathways and biological circuits that control cellular processes. These technologies not only improve communication systems between microorganisms but also expand their functionality through intercellular signaling and cooperative microbial networks [65]. \n\nA key aspect of synthetic biology is the availability of modular toolboxes that provide standardized genetic elements to control and optimize gene expression. These toolboxes include various types of promoters (constitutive and inducible), ribosome binding sites (RBSs) for translational efficiency, riboswitches that enable the dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to specific metabolites, and terminators ensuring proper transcriptional control. Additionally, synthetic biology toolkits often incorporate modular operons, genetic logic gates, and regulatory circuits that allow the precise manipulation of microbial metabolism. These elements are crucial for fine-tuning biosynthetic pathways and optimizing microbial production systems in pharmaceutical applications [66]. \n\nThrough the development of genetic platforms and control systems, synthetic biology has transformed microorganisms into tools for diagnosing diseases and precisely delivering therapeutic molecules. Engineered microbes have been successfully applied in biosensors and diagnostic platforms, enabling the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens and disease markers [67]. Engineered microbes overcome the limitations of traditional therapies by delivering therapeutic molecules in targeted, localized doses, minimizing side effects while maintaining efficacy. For example, microorganisms like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, capable of surviving in the human gut for extended periods, can be reprogrammed for the long-term monitoring and treatment of chronic diseases.\n...\nModified microorganisms are being developed as biodiagnostic and therapeutic tools to address health challenges such as treating gastrointestinal disorders and regulating the immune system. Moreover, researchers have adapted microorganisms to produce antimicrobial peptides to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. For instance, Lactobacillus species have been engineered to detect multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium and release antimicrobial peptides against it. This highlights the immense potential of targeted microbial therapies [74]. \n\nFurthermore, synthetic biology has significantly improved the efficiency of pharmaceutical production by enabling the precise regulation of metabolic pathways and the optimization of genetic circuits. For example, data-driven models integrated with CRISPR-Cas systems have been successfully applied to reprogram metabolic fluxes in yeast, significantly enhancing the production of bioactive compounds [75]. This achievement exemplifies the successful integration of computational methods and advanced genetic editing technologies for designing and optimizing synthetic pathways, demonstrating great potential for the scalable biomanufacturing of pharmaceuticals. \n\nSynthetic biology has enabled the reprogramming of microorganisms for the production of therapeutic compounds and other applications. By integrating chemical sensors with metabolic pathways, engineered microbes can detect specific molecules and dynamically regulate production efficiency. For instance, sensor-effector systems allow the real-time control of bioactive compound synthesis, facilitating the scaling of pharmaceutical production while maintaining precision and productivity [76]. These innovations highlight the critical role of synthetic biology in advancing microbial engineering. \n\nThe costs associated with research and development in synthetic biology have significantly increased in recent years. For instance, global investments in synthetic biology reached USD 9 billion in 2021. This funding has been directed toward developing new therapeutic tools, advancing gene engineering methods, and optimizing production processes [77,78]. Such investment levels highlight the rapid growth of synthetic biology and its establishment as a strategic direction in biotechnology. One of the most prominent examples of synthetic biology's efficiency in pharmaceutical production is the development of mRNA vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna utilized advanced synthetic biology tools to create vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These methods, which rely on sequence homology between the ends of DNA parts, have become widely adopted in synthetic biology, despite being incompatible with a key principle of engineering: modularity. To answer this, we present MODAL: a Modular Overlap-Directed Assembly with Linkers strategy that brings modularity to overlap-directed methods, allowing assembly of an initial set of DNA parts into a variety of arrangements in one-pot reactions. MODAL is accompanied by a custom software tool that designs overlap linkers to guide assembly, allowing parts to be assembled in any specified order and orientation. The in silico design of synthetic orthogonal overlapping junctions allows for much greater efficiency in DNA assembly for a variety of different methods compared with using non-designed sequence. In tests with three different assembly technologies, the MODAL strategy gives assembly of both yeast and bacterial plasmids, composed of up to five DNA parts in the kilobase range with efficiencies of between 75 and 100%. It also seamlessly allows mutagenesis to be performed on any specified DNA parts during the process, allowing the one-step creation of construct libraries valuable for synthetic biology applications.",

                    "text": "Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that takes an engineering approach to biosciences research and to the development of new biotechnologies (1,2). The rise of synthetic biology has been triggered by the increasing use of quantitative and mathematical techniques in biological research and the explosion of biological data (e.g. genome sequences) provided by the 'omics' era (3,4), combined with impressive decreases in the cost of custom synthesized genes and DNA (5,6). The capacity of synthetic biology is now largely limited by our ability to design, assemble and screen new DNA-encoded constructs for their intended biological function (7)(8)(9)(10). \n\nOne of the key engineering principles that synthetic biology researchers aim to apply to biology is standardization (11,12). Community efforts have made impressive steps toward standardization of measurement (13,14) and standardization of data and models (15,16); however, standardization of DNA assembly has fared less well. Early on in the emergence of synthetic biology, a standard for DNA assembly that defined DNA sequences as biological parts known as BioBricks (17), gained significant traction despite recognized shortcomings that include requiring all DNA parts to be absent of four common restriction enzyme recognition sites, and only permitting pairwise (two-at-a-time) assembly (9). Iterations of this standard have since appeared that address some of the limitations of BioBrick assembly and the BioBrick part format (18,19), but these have not been widely adopted. Instead, the DNA assembly methodologies that have seen the widest adoption within the synthetic biology community are those that do not require standardization of the parts involved. In particular, Gibson assembly, previously known as isothermal DNA assembly (20), has rapidly risen to being the most-used DNA assembly method in the field (21), despite being essentially a bespoke method, rather than a modular standard.",

T. MacDonald, Joachim De Jonghe, Georgia Christodoulou, P. Freemont, G. Baldwin, T. Ellis\n## Abstract\nOverlap-directed DNA assembly methods allow multiple DNA parts to be assembled together in one reaction. These methods, which rely on sequence homology between the ends of DNA parts, have become widely adopted in synthetic biology, despite being incompatible with a key principle of engineering: modularity. To answer this, we present MODAL: a Modular Overlap-Directed Assembly with Linkers strategy that brings modularity to overlap-directed methods, allowing assembly of an initial set of DNA parts into a variety of arrangements in one-pot reactions. MODAL is accompanied by a custom software tool that designs overlap linkers to guide assembly, allowing parts to be assembled in any specified order and orientation. The in silico design of synthetic orthogonal overlapping junctions allows for much greater efficiency in DNA assembly for a variety of different methods compared with using non-designed sequence. In tests with three different assembly technologies, the MODAL strategy gives assembly of both yeast and bacterial plasmids, composed of up to five DNA parts in the kilobase range with efficiencies of between 75 and 100%. It also seamlessly allows mutagenesis to be performed on any specified DNA parts during the process, allowing the one-step creation of construct libraries valuable for synthetic biology applications.\n## INTRODUCTION\nSynthetic biology is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that takes an engineering approach to biosciences research and to the development of new biotechnologies (1,2). The rise of synthetic biology has been triggered by the increasing use of quantitative and mathematical techniques in biological research and the explosion of biological data (e.g. genome sequences) provided by the 'omics' era (3,4), combined with impressive decreases in the cost of custom synthesized genes and DNA (5,6). The capacity of synthetic biology is now largely limited by our ability to design, assemble and screen new DNA-encoded constructs for their intended biological function (7)(8)(9)(10). \n\nOne of the key engineering principles that synthetic biology researchers aim to apply to biology is standardization (11,12). Community efforts have made impressive steps toward standardization of measurement (13,14) and standardization of data and models (15,16); however, standardization of DNA assembly has fared less well. Early on in the emergence of synthetic biology, a standard for DNA assembly that defined DNA sequences as biological parts known as BioBricks (17), gained significant traction despite recognized shortcomings that include requiring all DNA parts to be absent of four common restriction enzyme recognition sites, and only permitting pairwise (two-at-a-time) assembly (9). Iterations of this standard have since appeared that address some of the limitations of BioBrick assembly and the BioBrick part format (18,19), but these have not been widely adopted. Instead, the DNA assembly methodologies that have seen the widest adoption within the synthetic biology community are those that do not require standardization of the parts involved. In particular, Gibson assembly, previously known as isothermal DNA assembly (20), has rapidly risen to being the most-used DNA assembly method in the field (21), despite being essentially a bespoke method, rather than a modular standard.",

This could help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. Synthetic biology can also be used to improve the production of a variety of natural products and chemicals in industrial settings. Synthetic biology can also be used to store digital information in living organisms. \n\nMany different cutting-edge techniques are being used in synthetic biology. Some of the most common techniques are listed below. \n\n(2a) Genetic engineering and genome editing: \n\nThese techniques are used to alter the genetic makeup of an organism. This can be achieved by inserting new genes, removing existing genes, rewriting nucleotide sequences, or changing the order of genes. The recent state-of-art DNA synthesis methods developed in industry could accelerate the supply of long DNA. Relevant technologies include directed evolution, viral vectors, embryo manipulation, and cell/organoid culture. Synthetic biology is also used to regenerate extinct organisms. \n\n(2b) Informatics, Big data, and artificial intelligence: \n\nThis field of study uses computational methods to analyze large biological data. These data can be used to understand biological structures, including genomes, proteins, and multicellular and organismal societies, and devise new ones. Multimodal integration and spatial biology based on single-cell transcriptomics are creating the latest big datasets for understanding multicellular systems and assisting in the design of new biological systems. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including generative AI, hold great promise in this area. AI has already been used to predict the structures of proteins. \n\n(2c) Systems biology and metabolic engineering: Systems biology studies how different parts of a biological system interact. This knowledge can be used to modify genetic circuits, create new metabolic pathways, and invent new biological systems that are more efficient than natural systems.",

Yamagata\n## Abstract\nSynthetic biology is a science that uses engineering principles to design and build new biological systems [...]\n## body\n(1d) Generating renewable energy and natural products: Synthetic biology is being used to create new means of producing energy from renewable sources. This could help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. Synthetic biology can also be used to improve the production of a variety of natural products and chemicals in industrial settings. Synthetic biology can also be used to store digital information in living organisms. \n\nMany different cutting-edge techniques are being used in synthetic biology. Some of the most common techniques are listed below. \n\n(2a) Genetic engineering and genome editing: \n\nThese techniques are used to alter the genetic makeup of an organism. This can be achieved by inserting new genes, removing existing genes, rewriting nucleotide sequences, or changing the order of genes. The recent state-of-art DNA synthesis methods developed in industry could accelerate the supply of long DNA. Relevant technologies include directed evolution, viral vectors, embryo manipulation, and cell/organoid culture. Synthetic biology is also used to regenerate extinct organisms. \n\n(2b) Informatics, Big data, and artificial intelligence: \n\nThis field of study uses computational methods to analyze large biological data. These data can be used to understand biological structures, including genomes, proteins, and multicellular and organismal societies, and devise new ones. Multimodal integration and spatial biology based on single-cell transcriptomics are creating the latest big datasets for understanding multicellular systems and assisting in the design of new biological systems. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including generative AI, hold great promise in this area. AI has already been used to predict the structures of proteins. \n\n(2c) Systems biology and metabolic engineering: Systems biology studies how different parts of a biological system interact. This knowledge can be used to modify genetic circuits, create new metabolic pathways, and invent new biological systems that are more efficient than natural systems.",

While the field has seen many advances, bottlenecks in the complexity of the systems built are emerging and designs that function in the lab often fail when used in real-world contexts. Here, we propose an open-ended approach to biological design, with the novelty of designed biology being at least as important as how well it fulfils its goal. Rather than solely focusing on optimization toward a single best design, designing with novelty in mind may allow us to move beyond the diminishing returns we see in performance for most engineered biology. Research from the artificial life community has demonstrated that embracing novelty can automatically generate innovative and unexpected solutions to challenging problems beyond local optima. Synthetic biology offers the ideal playground to explore more creative approaches to biological design.",

When paired with an engineering mindset that brings together concepts of abstraction, standardization, and modularity (8), synthetic biology has been able to move beyond merely harnessing the inherent capabilities of biological systems and has pushed us toward creating entirely new-to-nature biological parts, devices, and systems (9,10). \n\nBiological engineering is distinct from other more established engineering disciplines because biology can adapt and evolve (11). Typically, human-engineered machines are designed according to a \"blueprint\" and consist of modular parts that can be studied using a reductionist framework. In contrast, biological systems have evolved and arise through self-organizing structures that adapt to changing contexts and environments. Living systems are also characterized by emerging multiscale structures that are complex and robust to change, the human brain being perhaps the best example. Furthermore, human-made machines often have a hardware-software duality where functions can be programmed and interrupted. Biological systems lack this separation, having their function and information processing embodied as part of the organism itself. Information is encoded not only in an organism's genome but also in the array of diverse components and processes making up each cell (12), e.g., the expressed proteins, metabolic fluxes, and cell membrane organization. \n\nThe ability for biology to evolve, i.e., its evolvability, can be both a blessing and a curse for synthetic biology. Evolution is a powerful engineering tool (13,14). However, it also allows biology to alter itself after deployment in unanticipated, potentially undesired, or dangerous ways (15)(16)(17). Directed evolution has become a routine tool in biotechnology for optimizing the function of biological components or systems (13,(18)(19)(20). Typically, a bioengineer creates a set of variants via random or directed mutagenesis or combinatorial recombination methods like SCRaMbLE (21). The library of variants is then screened via a selection procedure that retains the most performant designs.",

Gorochowski\n## Abstract\nDesign in synthetic biology is typically goal oriented, aiming to repurpose or optimize existing biological functions, augmenting biology with new-to-nature capabilities, or creating life-like systems from scratch. While the field has seen many advances, bottlenecks in the complexity of the systems built are emerging and designs that function in the lab often fail when used in real-world contexts. Here, we propose an open-ended approach to biological design, with the novelty of designed biology being at least as important as how well it fulfils its goal. Rather than solely focusing on optimization toward a single best design, designing with novelty in mind may allow us to move beyond the diminishing returns we see in performance for most engineered biology. Research from the artificial life community has demonstrated that embracing novelty can automatically generate innovative and unexpected solutions to challenging problems beyond local optima. Synthetic biology offers the ideal playground to explore more creative approaches to biological design.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe major difference from historical approaches to biological modification is our newfound ability to precisely alter or augment biology in useful ways, leaning on our growing knowledge of how biology works across scales and advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis (6,7). When paired with an engineering mindset that brings together concepts of abstraction, standardization, and modularity (8), synthetic biology has been able to move beyond merely harnessing the inherent capabilities of biological systems and has pushed us toward creating entirely new-to-nature biological parts, devices, and systems (9,10). \n\nBiological engineering is distinct from other more established engineering disciplines because biology can adapt and evolve (11). Typically, human-engineered machines are designed according to a \"blueprint\" and consist of modular parts that can be studied using a reductionist framework. In contrast, biological systems have evolved and arise through self-organizing structures that adapt to changing contexts and environments. Living systems are also characterized by emerging multiscale structures that are complex and robust to change, the human brain being perhaps the best example. Furthermore, human-made machines often have a hardware-software duality where functions can be programmed and interrupted. Biological systems lack this separation, having their function and information processing embodied as part of the organism itself. Information is encoded not only in an organism's genome but also in the array of diverse components and processes making up each cell (12), e.g., the expressed proteins, metabolic fluxes, and cell membrane organization. \n\nThe ability for biology to evolve, i.e., its evolvability, can be both a blessing and a curse for synthetic biology. Evolution is a powerful engineering tool (13,14). However, it also allows biology to alter itself after deployment in unanticipated, potentially undesired, or dangerous ways (15)(16)(17). Directed evolution has become a routine tool in biotechnology for optimizing the function of biological components or systems (13,(18)(19)(20). Typically, a bioengineer creates a set of variants via random or directed mutagenesis or combinatorial recombination methods like SCRaMbLE (21). The library of variants is then screened via a selection procedure that retains the most performant designs.",

We review current, likely, and potential genetic engineering (GE) applications for the development of disease-resistant crop cultivars. Gene editing, gene drives, and synthetic biology offer novel opportunities to control viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, parasitic weeds, and insect vectors of plant pathogens. We conclude that there will be no shortage of GE applications to tackle disease resistance and other farmer and consumer priorities for agricultural crops. Beyond reviewing scientific prospects for genetically engineered crops, we address the social institutional forces that are commonly overlooked by biological scientists. Intellectual property regimes, technology regulatory frameworks, the balance of funding between public- and private-sector research, and advocacy by concerned civil society groups interact to define who uses which GE technologies, on which crops, and for the benefit of whom. Ensuring equitable access to the benefits of genetically engineered crops requires affirmative policies, targeted investments, and excellent science.

                    "text": "Synthetic biology applies GE principles to design and alter natural systems or artificially construct biological devices and systems with predictable behaviors (83,121). CRISPR-mediated gene editing is a synthetic biology extension of current GE paradigms and is already proving useful for conferring various resistance traits to crops. Looking beyond gene editing, the redesign of simple genetic parts, usually as single components in a construct, such as promoters, has been the most frequent embodiment of synthetic biology. At its core, synthetic biology should be capable of endowing extensive and transformative changes to organisms by leveraging advanced computational design to build synthetic DNA constructs and then large-scale installation of many genetic components into plant genomes at once or in series. Analogous to the DNA sequencing revolution that has enabled reading genomic DNA, the emerging DNA synthesis revolution allows for unprecedented scales of writing DNA into genomes. \n\nIn Sc2.0 (http://syntheticyeast.org), the most ambitious synthetic biology program with a eukaryotic organism to date, each chromosome of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is being synthesized and inserted into the genome piece by piece (24,114). The goal is to create the first synthetic genome within a complex organism. This stepwise rebuilding of a complete genome elucidates an unprecedented understanding of the organism and its fundamental biology, raising immense prospects for rewriting genomes. Advances in synthetic biology may enable the design, building, and installation of a synthetic genome into plants (or even a chromosome or subgenome) to confer pest resistance or for other practical uses in agriculture. Indeed, writing large amounts of synthetic DNA into plants has natural precedence in the form of viruses, such as caulimovirus and geminivirus, that exist episomally and add information to plant genomes. \n\nThe most amenable subgenome in plants for synthetic engineering is the plastid genome, and the expanding list of crop plants with engineered plastids currently includes soybean, lettuce, and potato. Given that the plant kingdom excels in producing a wide range of biochemicals, it follows that the blueprints for endowing crops with new defense chemicals exist in nature.",

Pixley, J. Falck-Zepeda, Ken E. Giller, Leland L. Glenna, F. Gould, C. Mallory-Smith, D. Stelly, C. Stewart\n## Abstract\nGenetically engineered crops have been grown for more than 20 years, resulting in widespread albeit variable benefits for farmers and consumers. We review current, likely, and potential genetic engineering (GE) applications for the development of disease-resistant crop cultivars. Gene editing, gene drives, and synthetic biology offer novel opportunities to control viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, parasitic weeds, and insect vectors of plant pathogens. We conclude that there will be no shortage of GE applications to tackle disease resistance and other farmer and consumer priorities for agricultural crops. Beyond reviewing scientific prospects for genetically engineered crops, we address the social institutional forces that are commonly overlooked by biological scientists. Intellectual property regimes, technology regulatory frameworks, the balance of funding between public- and private-sector research, and advocacy by concerned civil society groups interact to define who uses which GE technologies, on which crops, and for the benefit of whom. Ensuring equitable access to the benefits of genetically engineered crops requires affirmative policies, targeted investments, and excellent science. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Phytopathology Volume 57 is August 26, 2019. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.\n## Synthetic Biology: Unfolding and Futuristic Genetic Engineering Technology\nSynthetic biology applies GE principles to design and alter natural systems or artificially construct biological devices and systems with predictable behaviors (83,121). CRISPR-mediated gene editing is a synthetic biology extension of current GE paradigms and is already proving useful for conferring various resistance traits to crops. Looking beyond gene editing, the redesign of simple genetic parts, usually as single components in a construct, such as promoters, has been the most frequent embodiment of synthetic biology. At its core, synthetic biology should be capable of endowing extensive and transformative changes to organisms by leveraging advanced computational design to build synthetic DNA constructs and then large-scale installation of many genetic components into plant genomes at once or in series. Analogous to the DNA sequencing revolution that has enabled reading genomic DNA, the emerging DNA synthesis revolution allows for unprecedented scales of writing DNA into genomes. \n\nIn Sc2.0 (http://syntheticyeast.org), the most ambitious synthetic biology program with a eukaryotic organism to date, each chromosome of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is being synthesized and inserted into the genome piece by piece (24,114). The goal is to create the first synthetic genome within a complex organism. This stepwise rebuilding of a complete genome elucidates an unprecedented understanding of the organism and its fundamental biology, raising immense prospects for rewriting genomes. Advances in synthetic biology may enable the design, building, and installation of a synthetic genome into plants (or even a chromosome or subgenome) to confer pest resistance or for other practical uses in agriculture. Indeed, writing large amounts of synthetic DNA into plants has natural precedence in the form of viruses, such as caulimovirus and geminivirus, that exist episomally and add information to plant genomes. \n\nThe most amenable subgenome in plants for synthetic engineering is the plastid genome, and the expanding list of crop plants with engineered plastids currently includes soybean, lettuce, and potato. Given that the plant kingdom excels in producing a wide range of biochemicals, it follows that the blueprints for endowing crops with new defense chemicals exist in nature.",

Each panel contained up to six samples with increasingly small copy number differences between the two reporter genes that ranged from 1- to 2-fold differences. These copy number differences represent the magnitude of changes that may need to be measured to validate an engineered system. Using digital PCR (dPCR), we demonstrated that it is possible to quantify changes in both gene and gene transcript numbers both within and between samples down to 1.05-fold. We corroborated these findings using a simple gene circuit within a bacterial model to demonstrate that dPCR was able to precisely identify small changes in gene expression of two transcripts in response to promoter stimulation. Finally, we used our findings to highlight sources of error that can contributed to the measurement uncertainty in the measurement of small ratios in biological systems.

Whale\n## Abstract\nThe use of standardized components and processes in engineering underpins the design-build-test model, and the engineering of biological systems is no different. Substantial efforts to standardize both the components and the methods to validate the engineered biological systems is ongoing. This study has developed a panel of control materials encoding the commonly used reporter genes GFP and RFP as DNA or RNA molecules. Each panel contained up to six samples with increasingly small copy number differences between the two reporter genes that ranged from 1- to 2-fold differences. These copy number differences represent the magnitude of changes that may need to be measured to validate an engineered system. Using digital PCR (dPCR), we demonstrated that it is possible to quantify changes in both gene and gene transcript numbers both within and between samples down to 1.05-fold. We corroborated these findings using a simple gene circuit within a bacterial model to demonstrate that dPCR was able to precisely identify small changes in gene expression of two transcripts in response to promoter stimulation. Finally, we used our findings to highlight sources of error that can contributed to the measurement uncertainty in the measurement of small ratios in biological systems. Together, the development of a panel of control materials and validation of a high accuracy method for the measurement of small changes in gene expression, this study can contribute to the engineering biology \u201ctoolkit\u201d of methods and materials to support the current standardization efforts.\n## body\nA dvances in engineering biology (also referred to as synthetic biology) are currently transforming our ability to produce new chemicals, energy, food, and medicines. 1,2 The field covers all aspects of intended manipulation and modification of living organisms. Standardization of the components and processes used is central to enhancing productivity and predictability, and to generate sustainable bioengineering of organisms that will ensure the development of repeatable high-quality products. 3,4 roadly, biological systems are engineered within host cells that have had their existing genetic material modified using editing methods such as CRISPR-Cas9, or by the addition of new genetic material in the form of expression vectors.

            "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, with an expected 1.5-3.0 million new cases and 0.5-2.0 million deaths in 2011 for the US and Europe, respectively (Jemal et al., 2011). Hence, this is an enormously important health risk, and progress leading to enhanced survival is a global priority. Strategies that have been pursued over the years include the search for new biomarkers, drugs or treatments (Rodrigues et al., 2007). Synthetic biology together with bioinformatics represents a powerful tool towards the discovery of novel biomarkers and the design of new biosensors. Traditionally, the majority of new drugs has been generated from compounds derived from natural products (Neumann & Neumann-Staubitz, 2010). However, advances in genome sequencing together with possible manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, constitute important resources for screening and designing new drugs (Carothers et al. 2009). Furthermore, the development of rational approaches through the use of bioinformatics for data integration will enable the understanding of mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effect of such drugs (Leonard et al., 2008; Rocha et al., 2010). Besides in biomarker development and the production of novel drugs, synthetic biology can also play a crucial role in the level of specific drug targeting. Cells can be engineered to recognize specific targets or conditions in our bodies that are not naturally recognized by the immune system (Forbes, 2010). Synthetic biology is the use of engineering principles to create, in a rational and systematic way, functional systems based on the molecular machines and regulatory circuits of living organisms or to re-design and fabricate existing biological systems (Benner & Sismour, 2005). The focus is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system (Endy, 2005). Virtually, through synthetic biology, solutions for the unmet needs of humankind can be achieved, namely in the field of drug discovery. Indeed, synthetic biology tools enable the elucidation of disease mechanisms, identification of potential targets, discovery of new chemotherapeutics or design of novel drugs, as well as the design of biological elements that recognize and target cancer cells. Furthermore, through synthetic biology it is possible to develop economically attractive microbial production processes for complex natural products.",

                    "text": "Synthetic biology uses biological insights combined with engineering principles to design and build new biological functions and complex artificial systems that do not occur in Nature (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The building blocks used in synthetic biology are the components of molecular biology processes: promoter sequences, operator sequences, ribosome binding sites (RBS), termination sites, reporter proteins, and transcription factors. Examples of such building blocks are given in Table 1. Great developments of DNA synthesis technologies have opened new perspectives for the design of very large and complex circuits (Purnick & Weiss, 2009), making it now affordable to synthesize a given gene instead of cloning it. It is possible to synthesize de novo a small virus (Mueller et al., 2009), to replace the genome of one bacterium by another (Lartigue et al., 2007) and to make large chunks of DNA coding for elaborate genetic circuits. Software tools to simulate large networks and the entire panel of omics technologies to analyze the engineered microorganism are available (for details see section 3). Finally, the repositories of biological parts (e.g. Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org/)) will increase in complexity, number and reliability of circuits available for different species. Currently, the design and synthesis of biological systems are not decoupled. For example, the construction of metabolic pathways or any circuit from genetic parts first requires a collection of well characterized parts, which do not yet fully exist. Nevertheless, this limitation is being addressed through the development and compilation of standard biological parts (Kelly et al., 2009). When designing individual biological parts, the base-bybase content of that part (promoter, RBS, protein coding region, terminator, among others) is explicitly dictated (McArthur IV & Fong, 2010). Rules and guidelines for designing genetic parts at this level are being established (Canton et al., 2008). Particularly, an important issue when designing protein-coding parts is codon optimization, encoding the same amino acid sequence with an alternative, preferred nucleotide sequence.",

Kluskens\n## Abstract\nCancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, with an expected 1.5-3.0 million new cases and 0.5-2.0 million deaths in 2011 for the US and Europe, respectively (Jemal et al., 2011). Hence, this is an enormously important health risk, and progress leading to enhanced survival is a global priority. Strategies that have been pursued over the years include the search for new biomarkers, drugs or treatments (Rodrigues et al., 2007). Synthetic biology together with bioinformatics represents a powerful tool towards the discovery of novel biomarkers and the design of new biosensors. Traditionally, the majority of new drugs has been generated from compounds derived from natural products (Neumann & Neumann-Staubitz, 2010). However, advances in genome sequencing together with possible manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, constitute important resources for screening and designing new drugs (Carothers et al. 2009). Furthermore, the development of rational approaches through the use of bioinformatics for data integration will enable the understanding of mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effect of such drugs (Leonard et al., 2008; Rocha et al., 2010). Besides in biomarker development and the production of novel drugs, synthetic biology can also play a crucial role in the level of specific drug targeting. Cells can be engineered to recognize specific targets or conditions in our bodies that are not naturally recognized by the immune system (Forbes, 2010). Synthetic biology is the use of engineering principles to create, in a rational and systematic way, functional systems based on the molecular machines and regulatory circuits of living organisms or to re-design and fabricate existing biological systems (Benner & Sismour, 2005). The focus is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system (Endy, 2005). Virtually, through synthetic biology, solutions for the unmet needs of humankind can be achieved, namely in the field of drug discovery. Indeed, synthetic biology tools enable the elucidation of disease mechanisms, identification of potential targets, discovery of new chemotherapeutics or design of novel drugs, as well as the design of biological elements that recognize and target cancer cells. Furthermore, through synthetic biology it is possible to develop economically attractive microbial production processes for complex natural products.\n## Synthetic biology: tools to design, build and optimize biological processes\nSynthetic biology uses biological insights combined with engineering principles to design and build new biological functions and complex artificial systems that do not occur in Nature (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The building blocks used in synthetic biology are the components of molecular biology processes: promoter sequences, operator sequences, ribosome binding sites (RBS), termination sites, reporter proteins, and transcription factors. Examples of such building blocks are given in Table 1. Great developments of DNA synthesis technologies have opened new perspectives for the design of very large and complex circuits (Purnick & Weiss, 2009), making it now affordable to synthesize a given gene instead of cloning it. It is possible to synthesize de novo a small virus (Mueller et al., 2009), to replace the genome of one bacterium by another (Lartigue et al., 2007) and to make large chunks of DNA coding for elaborate genetic circuits. Software tools to simulate large networks and the entire panel of omics technologies to analyze the engineered microorganism are available (for details see section 3). Finally, the repositories of biological parts (e.g. Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org/)) will increase in complexity, number and reliability of circuits available for different species. Currently, the design and synthesis of biological systems are not decoupled. For example, the construction of metabolic pathways or any circuit from genetic parts first requires a collection of well characterized parts, which do not yet fully exist. Nevertheless, this limitation is being addressed through the development and compilation of standard biological parts (Kelly et al., 2009). When designing individual biological parts, the base-bybase content of that part (promoter, RBS, protein coding region, terminator, among others) is explicitly dictated (McArthur IV & Fong, 2010). Rules and guidelines for designing genetic parts at this level are being established (Canton et al., 2008). Particularly, an important issue when designing protein-coding parts is codon optimization, encoding the same amino acid sequence with an alternative, preferred nucleotide sequence.",

            "text": "Life in every organism composed of cells is governed by a complex interplay of signalling pathways, metabolism and regulatory components. Synthetic biology aims to understand and harness components of these pathways at every level. 1 This engineering discipline also focuses on the development of frameworks for the rational design of novel biological systems through the application of fundamental engineering principles, such as abstraction, characterization, standardization, and modularization. 2,3 Following the key initial breakthroughs including the genetic toggle switch 4 and repressilator 5 at the beginning of the 21st century, rational design of biological systems benefited from advances in technical capabilities of DNA and RNA sequencing and synthesis, as well as the decreasing costs of these foundational tools of synthetic biology. 6 t the same time, the availability of mathematical and computational design tools for engineered biological systems has improved significantly. 7 Consequently, engineering biology has transformed from an intellectually stimulating intersection of engineering, systems theory and molecular biology that once drew the attention of a small number of engineers and biologists, to one of the most important engineering disciplines with major economic potential and societal impacts. 8 ombining improved understanding and rational design approach should lead to numerous practical applications in healthcare, 9 sustainability, 10 industry, [11][12][13] and many other areas of modern society. Indeed, synthetic biologists are developing novel therapeutic 14 and diagnostic modalities, 15 produce novel drug delivery systems, 16 discover new ways of decreasing the costs of bioproduction of industrial compounds 17 and support sustainability efforts. 10 Overall, synthetic biology is a major contributor to the global bioeconomy, which might have a direct economic impact of up to $4 trillion a year in the next two decades. 18 any countries have recognized the potential of engineering biology education, research and industry. These countries including the United Kingdom, the United States and Singapore have devoted significant resources not only to the planning of their national synthetic biology strategies, [19][20][21] but also to focusing on synthetic biology curriculum [22][23][24] investing in engineering biology research, 25,26 support of entrepreneurial efforts in rational biosystems design, and assistance in establishing of national synthetic biology ecosystems. 27,28",

            "text": "Synthetic biology goes beyond the genetic engineering approaches described in the work above by treating DNA not just as genetic information that can be mutated or added into cells but seeing it fundamentally as a modular code that can be treated like a programming language that can open up new possibilities in biotechnology [36]. Since its emergence in 2000, it has had a major impact on the engineering and industrial application of many organisms, most notably the model microbes E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast). The rich information available at the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels for these organisms have made them the go-to cells for creating modular DNA part libraries and rapid cloning toolkits that can quickly and easily combine these DNA parts into novel genetic programs [37,38]. Synthetic biology projects in these microbes regularly now involve the design and construction of synthetic DNA programs 10 s and 100 s of kilobases in length, often containing dozens of modular DNA parts and typically with many design variants built and tested in parallel [39,40]. \n\nGenome, transcriptome and metabolome data have only been generated quite recently for BC-producing organisms like K. xylinus. As such it is unsurprising that synthetic biology has been slower to take off for these bacteria. Nonetheless significant progress has been made in the last 5 years to introduce and use modular DNA programming for engineering BC-producing bacteria. This has resulted in a handful of publications that now use synthetic biology approaches to engineer cells to have new functionalities and to produce BC with modified material properties. Florea et al. (2016) were the first to bring the key principles of modular DNA engineering to BC-producing bacteria, when they described a 'toolkit' of standardized, modular DNA parts that could be used for genetic programming of controlled gene expression in the bacteria as they grow and produce cellulose pellicles [41]. Like many other innovations in synthetic biology, their work began as a student project for the international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition. They isolated, characterized and sequenced their own strain of Komagataeibacter taken from a kombucha tea pellicle.",

            "text": "In the past decade, the field of synthetic biology has flourished, significantly impacting fields such as metabolic engineering, protein engineering, computational biology, and whole-genome engineering [1]. A large portion of synthetic biology innovation has occurred under a framework of iterative cycles of \"design-build-test\" development. Growth in the field of synthetic biology can be correlated with innovations in each of the \"design\", \"build\", and \"test\" processes [2]. For example, there has been a significant effort in the standardization of parts within synthetic biology, with modularity and \"plug and play\" components receiving significant attention. Combined with the steady progress of systems biology, this modularization has enabled the \"design\" phase to become less time consuming and less dependent on specialized knowledge. The cost of DNA sequencing and synthesis has also decreased significantly in recent years, allowing the cheap synthesis of large constructs [3]. This has allowed a rapid improvement in the \"build\" phase, enabling researchers to explore a greater proportion of the biological solution space. Finally, high-throughput screening has also become a focal point within the synthetic biology \"test\" phase. The increased capacity for \"design\", and \"build\" has led to an increased need for throughput in assessing the plethora of new designs. In part, this has been achieved with the incorporation of robotics and high-throughput analytics into the laboratory setting, wherein new designs can be assayed at a volume not possible for human researchers [4]. \n\nBiosensors represent a revolutionary new technology that can be implemented for highthroughput screening. They are most simply defined as an analytical tool comprised of biological components that are used to detect the presence of a target ligand and to generate a signal [5]. Biosensors are at the forefront of synthetic biology, both as a tool for high-throughput screening, but also as the direct result of advances within the synthetic biology field itself. Furthermore, biosensors have received increased attention as alternatives to traditional analytics due to the unparalleled specificity and sensitivity that biological parts afford compared to conventional analytical techniques.",

            "text": "As interest and demand for this material rises, researchers and industry are increasingly looking to improve the biotechnology of BC production from bacteria. \n\nMicrobial biotechnology has been around for decades or even centuries depending on how you define it. However, in the last 20 years it has been transformed thanks to a slew of new tools and technologies for genome sequencing and genetic engineering. For the major industrial microbes-yeasts and Escherichia coli-the most transformative changes during this time have been due to the new field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology takes an engineering approach to genetically modifying a cell within a sequenced genome, treating its DNA as reprogrammable code that can be synthesized, edited and inserted into cells to improve specific cell functions or add new functionalities [16]. By taking cues from other engineering disciplines and making use of modularity, standardization and mathematical design approaches, synthetic biology has greatly accelerated what is possible for metabolic and genetic engineering in key microbes [17]. \n\nIn the last decade, what is possible in synthetic biology for E. coli and for yeasts has started to become possible in other microbes. Indeed a few pioneering groups have now begun to apply synthetic biology methods to Komagataeibacter in the hope of engineering strains of bacteria that produce higher yields of BC, make BC with improved quality or produce BC with modified properties or new functionalities that make it of high value for new research and application areas. In this review we will summarize how past work in genetic engineering of BC-producing bacteria has now led to the first successes in using synthetic biology in Komagataeibacter and in producing BC-based materials.",

Among various tools, the CRISPR-Cas system is modularly composed of guide RNA and Cas nuclease; therefore, it is convenient for editing the genome freely. Recently, various strategies have been developed to accurately edit the genome at a single nucleotide level. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas technology has been extended to molecular diagnostics for nucleic acids and detection of pathogens, including disease-causing viruses. Moreover, CRISPR technology, which can precisely control the expression of specific genes in cells, is evolving to find the target of metabolic biotechnology.

            "text": "Synthetic biology has been defined as 'the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically-based (or inspired) systems, which display functions that do not exist in nature' [41] and its emergence has led to a wide range of applications ranging from genetic circuits for monitoring metabolites, engineered foods, cellular computing and many other applications [42][43][44][45][46][47][48]. Consensus on this definition is not universal as it could be argued that the development of synthetic cells [49,50], genome-wide editing approaches [51], novel DNA base-pairs [52] and genome-wide engineering efforts [53] are also examples of synthetic biology approaches. Further, as synthetic biology borrows heavily from engineering and, molecular and systems biology approaches, the demarcations between these fields are ambiguous. Nonetheless, perhaps a characteristic feature of synthetic biology is the emphasis on higher-order abstraction in which distinct 'parts' are combined into 'modules' and then into 'circuits' [42]. We will use the definition of a biological 'component' as a protein, protein domain, or nucleic acid sequence and a 'part' represents a process or system that performs a particular function. A module represents a functional combination of parts with defined inputs and outputs, while a circuit represents the entire system of parts and modules. Within this framework, biological parts are the key functional units for building circuits [42]. A significant aim for synthetic biology is the development of circuits de novo using a range of standardized, interoperable parts, which has led to the development of parts lists [54] such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition repository (http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page) [55].\n\nThe development of biological circuits can be traced to the description of the lac operon by Jacob and Monod [56]. This pioneering work inspired recombinant cloning and expression technologies that used relatively simple switches for artificial gene regulation. With the recognition that even complex biological networks could be de-convoluted into simpler modules, genetic circuits such as toggle switches [57] and repressilators [58] were developed in the early 2000s. These circuits comprised parts that recognized environmental inputs, effected a logical",

We remark how synthetic biology became a turning point in designing these genetic tools to create meaningful innovations. We have placed special focus on the tools for engineering bacteria and fungi (both yeast and filamentous fungi) and those available to construct metagenomic libraries. Based on this overview, future goals would include the development of modular vectors bearing standardized parts and orthogonally designed circuits, a task not fully addressed thus far.

It plays a pivotal role in microbial engineering by enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and functionality of microorganisms for pharmaceutical applications. The ability to redesign gene expression to create minimal-genome microorganisms with novel traits or custom genetic circuits offers promising solutions for pharmaceutical applications, bioremediation, and biofuel production [63,64]. \n\nThe robust theoretical foundation of synthetic biology enables researchers to integrate protein engineering, DNA synthesis, and in silico design methods to construct metabolic pathways and biological circuits that control cellular processes. These technologies not only improve communication systems between microorganisms but also expand their functionality through intercellular signaling and cooperative microbial networks [65]. \n\nA key aspect of synthetic biology is the availability of modular toolboxes that provide standardized genetic elements to control and optimize gene expression. These toolboxes include various types of promoters (constitutive and inducible), ribosome binding sites (RBSs) for translational efficiency, riboswitches that enable the dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to specific metabolites, and terminators ensuring proper transcriptional control. Additionally, synthetic biology toolkits often incorporate modular operons, genetic logic gates, and regulatory circuits that allow the precise manipulation of microbial metabolism. These elements are crucial for fine-tuning biosynthetic pathways and optimizing microbial production systems in pharmaceutical applications [66]. \n\nThrough the development of genetic platforms and control systems, synthetic biology has transformed microorganisms into tools for diagnosing diseases and precisely delivering therapeutic molecules. Engineered microbes have been successfully applied in biosensors and diagnostic platforms, enabling the rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens and disease markers [67]. Engineered microbes overcome the limitations of traditional therapies by delivering therapeutic molecules in targeted, localized doses, minimizing side effects while maintaining efficacy. For example, microorganisms like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, capable of surviving in the human gut for extended periods, can be reprogrammed for the long-term monitoring and treatment of chronic diseases.",

            "text": "The origins of synthetic biology lie in the early 1960s when Jacob and Monod made groundbreaking discoveries on the regulation of lac operons in E. coli, an achievement that earned them the Nobel Prize [236].The authors found that a protein known as a transcription factor can bind to the promoter region of a gene, thereby regulating  [231,232] its synthesis rate by activating or repressing it.This paves the way for viewing gene expression as a dynamic system with recognizable inputs and outputs.This concept holds promise for combining input and output systems to construct more intricate functionalities [237].Since the late 1960s, progress in biotechnology has bestowed the scientific community with cost-effective and temporally efficient tools for DNA extraction, sequencing, amplification, and integration of exogenous DNA elements into cells.The advent of molecular cloning and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques in the 1970s and the 1980s made genetic manipulation common in microbiological research.In recognition of their pioneering work on restriction endonucleases, pivotal components of DNA synthesis, Smith, Arber, and Nathans were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978 [238].This recognition began a new biotechnological era, allowing the description and analysis of existing genes as well as the construction and evaluation of novel gene arrangements.Nevertheless, in the pre-genomic period, research methods categorized as genetic engineering were primarily confined to cloning and recombinant gene expression.In essence, the field of genetic engineering lacked the requisite knowledge and tools to engineer biological systems that could exhibit the diversity and intricacy of regulatory behaviors inherent in microorganisms [239,240].\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the emergence of automated DNA sequencing and improvements in computational tools have facilitated the sequencing of entire microbial genomes [241].As biologists and computer scientists embarked on a collaborative journey to reverse engineer cellular networks, the expanding confluence of molecular biology gave birth to the field of systems biology.In 2016, a consortium of prominent scientists proposed an ambitious synthetic biology endeavor known as the Human Genome Writing Project.This initiative leverages synthetic biology tools encompassing standardized genes, whole-genome synthesis, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to craft new genomes on a substantial scale.",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass, and often involves integration of multiple genes to re-direct metabolic fluxes [1]. In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering plays a critical part in bio-based production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass, and often involves integration of multiple genes to re-direct metabolic fluxes [1]. In recent years, biosynthesis techniques have attracted increased attention. As synthetic biology applications have grown in complexity, so too has the sophistication of available genetic and biochemical tools. For example, researchers started to produce antibiotic using microbial fermentation in the mid-20th century [2]. Currently, a dramatic change in the scope and complexity manufacturing processes within the space of synthetic biology has occurred. Thanks to development of genetic engineering, accomplishments have progressed from simple reconstitution of biosynthetic pathways in heterologous hosts to ambitious refactoring efforts [3][4][5] that can produce high titers of medicinally relevant compounds (strictosamide, taxa-diene, etc. ) [6,7] or amino acids (L-valine, L-threonine, etc. ) [8,9]. Up to now, synthetic biologists have employed many tools to modify and reform bacterial strains to produce desired compounds. These tools include well-characterized sets of expression vectors [10], promoters for dynamic pathway control [11,12], tunable protein degradation [13], and advanced methods for genome editing [14,15]. Synthetic biologists prefer two organisms for expression and optimization of heterologous biosynthetic pathways: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli is the most widely used prokaryotic system that produces heterologous proteins for industrial production of bacterial metabolites by batch and fed-batch operations [16,17]. E. coli is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating bacterium [18]. E. coli has been regarded as the workhorse of modern biotechnology in the microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals [19]. \n\nTo express heterologous proteins in E. coli, researchers have designed and developed a large number of expression vectors based on specific signals (such as promoters) that bacteria can recognize. One of the most frequently used expression systems is the T7 expression system.",

            "text": "What is Synthetic Biology? Synthetic Biology is an arising field of research that integrates basic sciences with engineering. The interdisciplinarity of Synthetic Biology is evident as it has evolved along with the progress made in Biology, Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, and Computer Science. The discovery of DNA as the molecule carrying the organisms' genetic information, the findings regarding the regulation of E. coli's lac operon, and the advent of recombinant DNA technology, all paved the way for Synthetic Biology. This field owes its further development to Computer Science, which made possible the construction of models that describe and predict the processes and interactions between and within biological systems. The goal of Synthetic Biology is to create, design, and redesign biological systems and devices to understand biological processes and to achieve useful and sophisticated functionalities to improve human welfare [1][2][3][4][5][6] . \n\nThe term \"synthetic biology\" was not always associated with the design of biological systems. In the 80s, the term was first used in the literature to describe bacteria that were genetically engineered employing recombinant DNA technology. Later, in the early 2000s, synthetic biology was associated with the synthesis of non-natural organic molecules that could function in living systems. The current definition of Synthetic Biology began to crystallize when the engineering community took part in the discussion and introduced the idea of extraction and reassembly of \"biological parts\" along with the principles of abstraction, modularity, and standardization. Abstraction refers to dissecting the design procedure into several hierarchies as an effective way to handle complexity. The division of the engineering process into several more straightforward abstraction levels (DNA, parts, devices, and systems) allows designers to work at a specific level somewhat independently to build a part, device, or system. Modularity or decoupling is the degree to which a system can be separated into \"functional blocks\" or orthogonal components. Functional blocks can be combined to construct modules with different functionalities that do not interact with each other. Finally, standardization aims to provide tools and protocols to ensure predictability and reproducibility in biological experimentation.

Synthetic biology covers a broad research area, which combines the disciplines in biology and engineering. It aims to design and create new biological systems to perform functions that are not found in nature. The statement of \"synthetic biology\" was first appeared in 1980. Until recently, with the matureness of genetic tools, the rapid growth of synthetic biology in research, innovation, and policy interest has been seen [1]. The opinion was held that synthetic biology will bring to the industries of chemical synthesis (including materials, energy, and natural compounds), medicine, agriculture, and environment a surprising \"gift\". \n\nSynthetic biology is deemed as an emerging research field, which will bring new opportunities as well as challenges to biotechnology. Synthetic biology can be classified into three levels. First, new types of regulatory network are constructed using natural biological motifs or modules with known functions. The second is to synthesize genomic DNA and reconstruct the living body using de novo synthesis method. The third is the creation of a completely new biological system and even artificial life after the first two fields have been well developed. By several decades' development of synthetic biology, great progresses in fundamental science and practical applications have been achieved. Furthermore, new breakthroughs will be brought to the biotechnology in the foreseeable future. \n\nSynthetic biology covers various aspects, including genetic circuits, minimal genomes, DNA synthesis, and genetic modification [2]. And also, synthetic biology can be developed in organisms with reverse genetic tools and methodologies, including genetic transformation, selection markers, specific plasmid vectors, different promoters, and other advanced molecular biology techniques, such as (zinc finger proteins) ZFPs, (transcription activators like effector nucleases) TALENs, and (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) CRISPR [3,4]. To provide insight to further understand synthetic biology and discuss future perspectives in this area, the most updated techniques occurring in synthetic biology are summarized in this review.",

            "text": "The plant synthetic biology field has exploded in the last five years, in part driven by techniques such as CRISPR and cheap DNA synthesis. This review summarizes the current state of research in plant synthetic biology, and how it is being applied to two topics: renewable fuels and chemicals, and medicine. \n\nbiology-based toolkit that uses abstraction, standardization, and automated construction to change how we build biological systems and expand the range of possible products.\" The application of engineering principles to biology requires us to be able to move from a sequenced genome to a predictable systems output, which is very challenging. 7 The engineering concept of the design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle can underpin the application of synthetic biology to organismal engineering (Figure 1(a)). 8,9 Synthetic biology aims to speed up the rate at which we move round the DBTL cycle, and, combined with systems biology, encourages us to explicitly learn from each experiment and integrate that knowledge into the next iteration. Engineers rely on interchangeable components and this concept has also been adopted by synthetic biologists. In microbial synthetic biology, this was pioneered by the BioBrick standards (https://biobricks.org/) and more recently a plant standard has been developed based on Type IIS restriction endonuclease assembly 10 (Figure 1(b)). \n\nHow does synthetic biology differ from conventional genetic engineering? It can be considered in some senses a continuum. Whereas genetic engineering may manipulate the expression of a single gene, synthetic biology aims to go much further -for example by the introduction of a complete metabolic pathway under tight regulatory control. While the design, synthesis and expression of the DNA parts are important, it is also the incorporation of systems data (such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and mathematical modeling into subsequent experiments that really sets synthetic biology apart. The eventual goal is to possess biological blueprints such that we can understand and modify an organism, as an engineer does a car. For plants, these latter goals are still very distant. However, progress has been made, and it is that which will be discussed in this review.",

            "text": "The development of economically feasible and sustainable biotechnological processes as alternatives to oil based chemistry is one of the major goals of biobased economy. The success of this strategy will require efficient, robust and versatile cell factories but the improvement of currently used strains towards such platforms is hindered by the limitations of conventional methods for strain improvement. Synthetic biology is expected to provide means for engineering cell factories in a more efficient and controllable way. Synthetic biology is regarded as the engineering discipline by which novel organisms can be constructed by assembling parts, devices and modules into systems. Proponents such as the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) foundation aim at a high level of standardization and foster the definition of a framework of rules for the conceptualization, design and manufacture of biological systems with predictable properties. A more practical, problem driven approach, however, sees synthetic biology as the field that makes use of advanced tools of genetic engineering, genomics and systems biology in order to programme and control a biological device and create new behaviour previously not found in that system. In contrast to the former approach, this description does not draw a clear line to other sciences; the designation of a strain as simply genetically engineered or synthetic seems rather arbitrary. Because of the complexity of biological systems, each problem is seen as unique and the occurrence of unpredictable effects of genetic modifications is expected, making attempts for standardization a futile effort. Irrespective of the ongoing debate about its definition [1,2], there is general agreement that the success of synthetic biology in biotechnology will rely on the development of new methods to analyse and control cell systems and to allow for the targeted modification of genomes on a large scale. Hence, with the advance of recent genome editing techniques, of next generation sequencing and gene synthesis, and the merging of large datasets with modelling and novel bioinformatics tools, we expect that synthetic biology will significantly advance the design of industrially relevant strains for producing novel chemicals. \n\nThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most intensively studied unicellular eukaryote and one of the main industrial microorganisms used in the production of biochemicals.",

            "text": "Compatible expression vectors are widely used in synthetic biology, and are of great importance for the efficient co-expression of multiple genes. Synthetic biology is a discipline that integrates the application of science, technology, and engineering to facilitate and accelerate the design, modification, and alteration of genetic material in living organisms. Synthetic biology breaks away from the limits of natural evolution and focuses on \"artificial design and genome editing\" to produce specific target products. In this study, the Duet family of expression vectors was genetically edited using biosynthetic techniques, and plasmids were constructed, designed, and modified. The Duet family of expression vector replicons is mutually compatible and contains different antibiotic markers, allowing the stable co-expression of multiple genes in E. coli [25,27]. The synthesis, assembly, and editing of genetic material such as DNA are of great importance to biosynthetics. Using gene-editing techniques, recombinant plasmids are edited by ligating the target gene to a compatible expression vector. The recombinant plasmids of different copy numbers were then transferred to the same E. coli BL21 (DE3)\u2206nanA to achieve the co-expression of multiple genes. The change from \"discovery\" to \"creation\" opens up new ideas for genetic modification. Many biological functions are not controlled by a single gene, but require the coordinated action of multiple related genes. The use of genetic engineering techniques to co-express multiple genes in the same host bacterium is an effective tool for developmental regulation studies and metabolic pathway modification in E. coli. The target gene is integrated into a compatible expression vector using gene assembly technology. The target gene is cleaved with the same fast cutting enzyme as the vector, and the two are then ligated to create the desired expression vector. Synthetic biology has a wide range of applications in health care. PSA plays an important role in numerous biogenic reactions in living organisms, and is also an ideal material for controlled drug release and scaffolding. The multiple biological effects of PSA make it promising for a wide range of applications in the biomedical field.",

The introduction of mutations in chromosomes, such as nucleotide substitutions, gene deletions or insertions, and the overexpression of homologous or heterologous genes can affect the expression of target proteins. Specific genes in cellular pathways involved in protein biogenesis can be temporarily or permanently modified in a targeted manner by using RNA interference, Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) gene editing systems. Global genetic or strain engineering and whole genome analysis tools, such as random mutagenesis, RNA interference screens, whole genome fluxomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses, have also been employed to identify novel target molecules involved in protein biogenesis.

By mining naturally occurring systems and employing conventional means of protein engineering, such as rational design, saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution, significant progress has been made in the field of gene editing. A prime example of such success is the discovery and optimization of CRISPR-Cas systems, which has been successfully adapted for efficient gene-editing in mammalian cells. Subsequently, various higher-activity, high-specificity, and/or expanded-PAM variants have been generated, along with various inventive modalities such as base editors and prime editors. These innovations highlight the dramatic advancements made in enhancing the precision and versatility of gene-editing tools. \n\nMoving forward, the integration of AI/ML will revolutionize future gene editor discovery and engineering by reducing the cost and time required for such efforts. AI/ML also has the potential to allow the design of de novo editors with unprecedented efficiency, specificity and safety, while introducing novel editing capabilities tailored to specific therapeutic applications. The convergence of synthetic biology and AI/ ML, underpinned by training on expansive and high-quality data sets, could unlock the full potential of gene-editing technologies, redefining the landscape of gene therapy and personalized medicine and transforming healthcare on a global scale.",

Craig Venter Institute.Other emerging variants of synthetic biology include in-vitro synthetic biology [41], RNA synthetic biology [42], cyanobacterial synthetic biology [43], plant synthetic biology [44] and nano-enabled synthetic biology [45].\n\nWhile low in frequency, these modules or flavours of synthetic biology suggest the diversification and potential fragmentation of the field.This is important for policy debates because the longer term implication is that synthetic biology may cease to be a 'unitary' object for policy action and become multiple in applications to particular organisms or the components of organisms.\n\nViewed purely from the perspective of key terms, synthetic biology emerges as a research mobilisation around the term ''synthetic biology'' and, to a lesser extent, ''synthetic genomics'' that draws on methods, techniques and technologies from a wider range of established and emergent research areas.That is, synthetic biology is a rallying flag around which researchers are articulating themselves focusing on genetic circuits, networks, pathways and parts and extending to minimal cells, genome transplantation, synthetic genomes and whole genome engineering.Synthetic biology draws on a variety of techniques from systems biology, metabolic engineering, protein engineering and genetic engineering but cannot simply be reduced to these fields.",

Bacteria that can be programmed to take photographs [2] or form visible patterns [3]. Cells that can count the number of times they divide [4]. A live polio virus \"created from scratch using mailorder segments of DNA and a viral genome map that is freely available on the Internet\" [5]. These are some of the remarkable, and occasionally disturbing, fruits of \"synthetic biology,\" the attempt to construct life starting at the genetic level. In terms of their scale and ambition, these efforts go beyond traditional recombinant DNA technology. Rather than simply transferring a pre-existing gene from one species to another, synthetic biologists aim to make biology a true engineering discipline.\n\nIn the same way that electrical engineers rely on standard capacitors and resistors, or computer programmers rely on modular blocks of code, synthetic biologists wish to create an array of modular biological parts that can be readily synthesized and mixed together in different combinations. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has a Registry of Standard Biological Parts that supports this goal by indexing biological parts that have been built, and offering assembly services to construct new parts, devices, and systems [6]. Systems, devices, parts, and DNA represent descending levels of complexity-systems consist of devices, and devices consist of parts composed of DNA. The idea behind a registry of parts is that these parts can, and should, be recombined in different ways to produce many different types of devices and systems. Although the registry currently contains physical DNA, its developers believe that, as DNA synthesis technology becomes increasingly inexpensive [7], the registry will be composed largely of information and specifi cations that can be executed in synthesizers just as semiconductor chip designs are executed by fabrication fi rms.\n\nSynthetic biology has already produced important results, including more accurate AIDS tests and the possibility of unlimited supplies of previously scarce drugs for malaria [8]. Proponents hope to use synthetic organisms to produce not only medically relevant chemicals but also industrial materials, including biofuels such as hydrogen and ethanol [9]. At the same time, synthetic biology has engendered numerous policy concerns. From its inception, commentators have raised issues ranging from bioethical and",

These include the understanding of gene circuitry and the protein-based regulation of gene transcription as well as the tools provided by recombinant DNA technology (e.g., Jacob and Monod 1961;Szybalski and Skalka 1978). These foundational concepts and methods made synthetic biology possible, in principle. In practice, recombinant DNA allowed the production of engineered proteins, but the engineering of whole organisms has had to wait for four developments: inexpensive DNA synthesis, rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing, a large collection of components in the form of well-characterized genetic modules from years of study and from genome sequencing efforts, and a selfconscious importation of engineering approaches. The importance of DNA synthesis and sequencing in synthetic biology has been reviewed by others (Carlson 2003;Knight 2005), so we will focus on the availability of modular genetic parts. For synthetic biology, the modules of biological systems, from DNA to RNA, protein, and pathway levels, constitute a natural set of building blocks for engineering.",

            "text": "In comparison to the genetic toolboxes for work in popular heterotrophic chasses like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, relatively limited genetic tools have been developed in cyanobacteria (Sun et al., 2018). The design of standardized gene expression parts (e.g., promoters, terminators) that can be modularly recombined with other genetic elements with predictable outputs has catalyzed a revolution in the complexity of heterotrophic genetic circuits (Popp et al., 2017). Unfortunately, many of the synthetic biology tools and modular parts developed for model heterotrophs often do not perform as robustly in the context of cyanobacterial strains (Huang et al., 2010). For example, many characterized E. coli promoters do not display similar traits when used in cyanobacteria (Heidorn et al., 2011). These problems may arise in part because of species-dependent distinctions in key features, such as RBS sequences or promoter recognition by endogenous transcription, leading to unpredictability in gene expression (Huang et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2012;Camsund and Lindblad, 2014). In recent years, significant efforts have been made in adapting molecular techniques from other organisms in order to extend cyanobacterial toolboxes and facilitate cellular reprogramming for increased production yields. Here, we outline the latest advances in cyanobacterial synthetic biology tools, including promoters, riboswitches, RBSs, reporters, modular vectors, and markerless selection systems.",

It is true that scientists have been attempting to design biological systems for decades. However, synthetic biology has become a field of its own only recently, mostly driven by the advances in systems biology and the development of new powerful tools for DNA synthesis and sequencing.

            "text": "Synthetic biology uses a ground-up approach to genetic engineering with a vision to solve the technical and conceptual bottlenecks associated with the field. Standard biological parts have emerged as a mechanism through which researchers can emphasize the engineering component of genetic engineering. To viably implement such a vision, however, a new experimental approach that can systematically identify and optimize biological function is needed. Currently there are no established methodologies to encapsulate biological part function such that meaningful, quantitative predictions about genetic composition can be made a priori. Although in practice post-hoc analyses of projects provide insights into the individual properties of parts, most engineering strategies require either an ad-hoc search of intuitively-chosen constructs or library-based approaches. In the hands of experienced researchers these methods can be quite effective for systems containing up to 6 genes [1]. Nevertheless, beyond this scale these methods appear to be insufficient. We have implemented an alternate approach to experimental design that uncovers optimal solutions to design problems by linking automated DNA fabrication to effective construct screening. In the first step, we use cost effective, fast and scalable DNA fabrication methods to generate large sets of explicit DNA constructs automatically. In the second step, we functionally screen those DNAs via readily available assays that are also automatable, cost effective, fast and scalable. Additionally, we integrate these activities under a software tool chain specifically developed for these types of applications. By linking these functions together into a single process we not only uncover optimal solutions to a design problem, but also encapsulate important data about the parts from which they were composed. In turn, this leads to greater insight and faster optimization.\n\nTo illustrate how this alternate approach can be implemented in a synthetic biology lab we have focused on the production of multi-subunit protein complexes. The ability to produce functional protein from recombinant sources is essential in synthetic biology and for the scientific community at large. Nevertheless, producing these proteins quickly and successfully, particularly in the case of multi-subunit complexes, can be challenging. Given an overall lack of tools available to quickly and effectively identify appropriate conditions a priori, production efforts are often inefficient, resulting in poor or failed attempts. In these cases, original constructs need to be modified, which is often costly, laborintensive and time-consuming, particularly if multiple rounds of",

            "text": "Microorganisms are at the core of the production of pharmaceuticals, industrial enzymes, and fine chemicals. In many cases, heterologous expression of genes is required to meet commerciallevel demands of target proteins and/or metabolites. In this context, variation in codon usage is considered as one of the major factors affecting protein expression levels, since the presence of rare codons can reduce the translation rate and induce translation errors with a significant impact on the economics of recombinant microbe-based production processes (Ikemura, 1981;Gustafsson et al., 2004). The generation of massive genome sequencing data and cost-effective custom DNA synthesis are foundational technologies for synthetic biology, an emerging discipline that aims to create novel organisms containing designer genetic circuits for the production of drugs, industrial enzymes, biofuels, and chemicals (Endy, 2005;McDaniel and Weiss, 2005;Heinemann and Panke, 2006;Leonard et al., 2008). These circuits are built from standard biological parts, including vectors, promoters, ribosomal binding sites (RBSs), transcriptional terminators, and other gene expression regulatory elements. These parts were initially borrowed from nature and nowadays engineered, to adapt their performance to a particular application, or combined to create sophisticated devices (Shiue and Prather, 2012). \n\nOver the past decade, synthetic biology has contributed to significantly reduce the cost of many products manufactured in microbial systems where only one gene needs to be over-expressed. In many cases, the production of a target protein can be boosted by several orders of magnitude by replacing a native sequence with its optimized counterpart (Gustafsson et al., 2004(Gustafsson et al., , 2012)). This seemingly simple adjustment is of remarkable importance, since many of these products are now traded as commodities and thus there is a continuous need to reduce manufacturing costs in order to remain competitive in the global markets (Menzella, 2011). The ambitious next step of synthetic biology is to further reduce the cost and time involved in developing recombinant organisms by using pre-assembled parts that provide stable, predictable protein expression (Dellomonaco et al., 2010;Nielsen and Keasling, 2011).",

Extract-based systems have been utilized to rapidly evaluate different RBSs, showing the inconsistency between the theoretical prediction and actual protein synthesis levels (Wang et al., 2018). Interestingly, recent studies showed that there was also a deviation between the in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis levels using the same elements (Zhang et al., 2021). Therefore, the systematic characterization of the regulation of protein expression in various strains and even in vitro systems is necessary for improving standardization and modularization in synthetic biology. \n\nIn this study, we systematically quantified the expression levels of 416 superfolder GFP (sfGFP) expression cassettes with various 5\u2032-UTR sequences in two E. coli strains, BL21 Star (DE3) and JM109 (DE3), as well as an in vitro lysate-based system to evaluate the consistency of UTR function. In contrast to the strong correlation between these two cellular systems, the consistency between in vivo and in vitro protein translation is lost, whereby both in vivo and in vitro translation levels evidently deviate from the estimation of the standard statistical thermodynamic model. Specifically, we also quantified the function of 5\u2032-UTRs comprising only three types of nucleotides. Finally, we found that the absence of C nucleotides and a complex secondary structure in the 5\u2032-UTR significantly improve protein translation, both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we believe that designing genetic elements with high consistency across various strains and even in vitro systems is necessary for effective standardization and modularization in synthetic biology.",

            "text": "For many centuries, humans have been constantly modifying plants that are beneficial to them. With advancements in crop improvement practices, modification of plant characteristics that were beneficial especially in terms of yield, were favorably targeted. For many decades, traditional breeding practices along with mutation breeding programs have been instrumental in modifying agricultural traits in crop plants. However, a growing global population coupled with altered weather patterns, present multifaceted challenges to future agricultural production both for food and non-food applications. Synthetic biology has emerged as a viable technology for rapid, precise, and robust engineering of organisms for useful societal purposes (Shih et al., 2016). Synthetic biology attempts to create user-designed biological systems including plants which can display various characteristics such as responses to nutrition status, infections or to changes in environment. One defining emphasis of synthetic biology is the designed control of gene expression. Through various approaches, gene expression can be controlled at the DNA, RNA, or protein level, depending on the strategy or application. The increasing availability of resources to efficiently inactivate or replace genes in complex organisms such as plants, has led to a revolution in genome editing in the plant science community. Gene editing tools allow targeting of specific DNA sequences within the plant genome thereby enabling researchers to engineer genes and genomes with higher precision than would have been possible earlier. The various tools and technologies utilized in plant synthetic biology have been discussed in previous reviews (Bortesi and Fischer, 2015;Schaeffer and Nakata, 2015;Puchta, 2016;Weeks et al., 2016). While most of the focus of synthetic biology has been on microbes, plant synthetic biology has made rapid progress in recent years. Within the last few years, synthetic biology approaches for regulating plant responses has been successfully demonstrated in several crop species (Table 3). As gene editing techniques become more precise, the modulation of photoreceptor activity by engineering designer photoreceptors provides novel opportunities for improving productivity of crop plants. While different engineered photoreceptor systems may require different designs for optimal function (Schmidt and Cho, 2015), such photoreceptor systems can be utilized to determine how the light input affects agronomically beneficial phenotypes.",

            "text": "These technological advancements have since led to the creation of a vast and ever-growing catalog of cellular components and their interactions which, in-turn, has enabled a bottom-up approach to designing regulatory networks and circuits that can be used for the biosynthesis of various biochemical products (e.g., proteins and metabolites) 7 . Moreover, the modular components within this catalog can be assembled and tested to identify combinations that yield further advantages beyond each individually. One such modular component, a genetic toggle switch, was engineered into Escherichia coli in the early 2000's 8 , which resulted in the creation of the first synthetic biological system 8 . This breakthrough paved the way for further advances such as bacteria that produce biofuels or cells programmed to target cancer cells. \n\nIn the past, synthetic biologists have primarily used DNA as the molecule of choice for designing synthetic systems. As a result, synthetic DNA had been instrumental in the development of artificial genes 9 , gene regulatory networks 10 , and even entire genomes 11,12 , enabling scientists to study complex biological processes and even create synthetic organisms 2,13 . However, with the rise of RNA therapeutics, there has been a growing interest in developing synthetic systems exploiting the unique attributes of RNA molecules. RNA is more than just a messenger-it has a direct role in regulating cellular behavior and, in the past few years, large libraries of RNA parts affecting almost every step of biological control have become available 14 . RNA-based systems constructed using these libraries are safer than those constructed from DNA as they do not integrate into the host genome, making them suitable for therapeutic applications with higher safety standards 15 . Unlike DNA-based systems, RNA-based systems, built from RNA devices and circuits, are fast-acting as they do not require transcription 16 . Using diverse libraries of RNA components, researchers have begun to generate RNA-based systems that couple environmental sensing with functional outputs for therapeutic synthetic biology applications 17,18 . \n\nThe recent success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has sparked a surge in interest in RNA therapeutic technology and how the field of synthetic biology can be employed. Particularly, there are some challenges associated with RNA technology which can be addressed using synthetic biology. For example, base modifications and mRNA circularization have been employed to reduce mRNA immunogenicity and improve mRNA's lifespan respectively.",

An amalgamation of various fields, different experts have defined synthetic biology differently. However, at its core, synthetic biology centres at design, construction and characterisation of improved or novel biological systems [1]. \n\nMuch of the inspiration for the field is derived from the diversity and complexity of biological cells. Their complexity has paved way to allow for the design and modification of a system's functionality or the addition of a new function. Much of this field relies heavily upon an engineering-driven approach that accelerates the design-build-test loops required for reprogramming existing and constructing new systems [2]. One of the many unique capabilities of synthetic biology lies within this ability. \n\nThis advancement has seen synthetic biology to have broad applications not only in the medical, biofuel, chemicals and biomaterials field but also provides a revolutionary tool in the understanding of basic life sciences. Though synthetic biology is often rooted to its origins in genetic engineering, it is an umbrella term for a much wider field of its own. Genetic engineering in its own right is now a very mature field; however, much of the modern field synthetic biology is in its infancy using lesser understood and, arguably, unreliable methods [3]. \n\nThe first wave of synthetic biology focused upon the combination of basic elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and transcriptional repressors to form modules with specified behaviours. Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes [4,5]. Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches [6], pulse generators [7], oscillators [8] and digital logic gates [9]. These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation.",

            "text": "A model example of synthetic biology is synthetic nucleases. Fusion of synthetic domains modeled on the DNA-binding domains of zinc finger (ZNF) proteins or transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) with the nuclease domain of a natural restriction endonuclease, synthetic enzymes have been developed that enable scientists to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in any genomic locus they wish [63]. \n\nModular genetic fragments constitute the key components which are combined to create synthetic biological systems. For full functionality, each part requires its own unique mathematical model-guided designs and quantitative function characterisation [64]. Currently, plant synthetic biology still lags behind yeast, bacterial and mammalian systems, which have significantly contributed to research efforts and are also extensively applied in the biotechnological and biopharmaceutical industries [65,66]. Standardization of genetic parts and development of modular cloning tools constituted the pioneering efforts towards establishing a more generalised implementation of synthetic biology strategies for plant research and applications [67,68]. Reported potential benefits of applications of synthetic biology to efforts to increase food production and quality include development of synthetic metabolic routes for improved CO 2 fixation and carbon-conservation, reduction of natural and synthetic fertiliser application in agriculture by engineering nitrogen fixation in crop plants and construction of synthetic plant microbiome consortia, increased nutritional value of crop plants and the utilisation of photoautotrophic organisms as production platforms for commercially interesting compounds [69]. \n\nGiven the importance of synthetic biology, groups such as Open Plant (https://www.openplant.org/) and the Joint BioEnergy Institute (https://public-registry.jbei.org/) are currently developing open-source registries for plant-specific DNA parts [12]. Also, Synbio Africa, a forum for researchers, students, citizen scientists, policy makers and the public at large, convenes to strategise and develop successful pathways for the propagation of synthetic biology technologies, products and services throughout Africa [70]. Again, there is the Biomaker Africa programme which aims to train biologists, as well as non-biologists, to learn, design, prototype and share science hardware critical to building tools for laboratory use and environmental sensing.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology aims to use modular, well-characterised biological parts to predictably construct novel genetic devices and complex cell-based systems following engineering principles [1]. This process has shown particular promise in Escherichia coli, where many useful parts and devices have been described [2,3] and a public-benefit facility (biofab.org) now exists to produce freeto-access collections of standard biological parts [4]. Rationally combining well-characterised parts and devices using modelling to aid design has allowed complex systems to be produced, endowing bacteria with novel abilities such as pattern formation [5], edgedetection [6] and co-ordinated oscillation [7]. Key parts that enable this advanced engineering include promoters, particularly regulated promoters, as these control gene network logic and are routinely used to provide nodes at which to combine devices [6]. Currently, there are a limited number of well-characterised promoter systems in synthetic biology and this presents a bottleneck to increasing the complexity of designs [8][9][10]. \n\nThe budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a long history of use in biotechnology and has also emerged as a versatile chassis for synthetic biology. Yeast cells have been previously engineered using synthetic biology to exhibit a variety of useful properties that include regulatory responses to light as an input, production of a precursor of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin, and expression of external cellulosome components that allow cellulose degradation [11][12][13][14]. It has also been demonstrated that model-based approaches can be used to investigate and produce predictable behaviours in synthetic gene networks in yeast [15,16]. Furthermore, recent ground-breaking work placing synthetic re-factored chromosomal arms into living cells indicates great promise for the future construction of large, modular synthetic biology systems in yeast [17]. Yet, to accelerate yeast to a chassis for advanced synthetic biology on par with E. coli, there is still a need for more fundamental parts and devices, particularly as multiple re-use of the same biological parts in Saccharomyces poses problems due to the cell's natural ability to recombine long stretches of homologous DNA [18].",

            "text": "I ncreased ability to engineer microbial hosts has led to quick expansion of synthetic biology applications ranging from therapeutic cells to biological production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. 1 This ability has been enabled by the availability of novel genome editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, by rapid and affordable DNA sequencing and synthesis services, and by the use of modular and standardized DNA parts that allow quick assembly and optimization of genetic systems. Such tools are especially well established for the commonly used model and production organisms such as Escherichia coli. Another widely used model and production host with a comprehensive collection of engineering tools is the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, development of the tools in S. cerevisiae lags behind as compared to E. coli. Especially tools for gene expression control need to be developed further. 2 he orthogonality of gene expression systems is an important feature to limit or, in the best case, completely avoid the cross-talk between the engineered gene circuit and the native cellular regulation. The use of homologous (native) DNA regulatory parts in an expression system can lead to unintended behavior that is caused, for instance, by changing growth conditions during extended bioprocesses. This is due to the often poorly understood, complex native cellular regulation in which several transcription factors and other regulators are involved and can influence the performance of the expression system. 3,4 Adjustability, expression output stability and predictability, the ability to reach high expression levels, and independence on specific inducer compounds are also desirable features of gene expression tools. To address these challenges, a number of recent studies describe development of orthogonal gene expression tools for S. cerevisiae. \u22129 Modularity of the different parts is a great advantage as it allows design of sTFs with desired functions and target specificities. In addition, the existing parts typically originate from evolutionarily distant organisms, such as bacterial repressor proteins, 6,9\u221211 zinc finger domains, 3,5,8,11 transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), 12 or the Cas9 null mutant (dCas9) protein, 12\u221214 which have no homologues in yeast and thus potentially provide a high degree of orthogonality.",

Standardization of the components and processes used is central to enhancing productivity and predictability, and to generate sustainable bioengineering of organisms that will ensure the development of repeatable high-quality products. 3,4 roadly, biological systems are engineered within host cells that have had their existing genetic material modified using editing methods such as CRISPR-Cas9, or by the addition of new genetic material in the form of expression vectors. Similar to that of natural cellular networks, the modified genetic region(s) encodes RNA that encode protein molecules that respond to environmental stimuli or control other genetic regions with positive and negative feedback loops, comparable to the logic gates in an electronic circuit, that consequently produce biochemicals or biomaterials. 5  crucial principle in all fields of engineering is the use of standardized components and processes; the engineering of biological systems is no different. 6,7 \u221211 Repositories containing standardized parts and components, such as highly characterized plasmid vectors, have been established to utilize a \"plug and play\" model. Examples include the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA) 12 and BioBricks. 13,14  second aspect in need of standardization are the methods used to build, validate, or measure the output of the novel biological system. Depending on the system, it may be necessary to determine the gene cargo delivery efficiency, integration efficiency, specificity in terms of the correct modifications being made, and identification of off-target effects that encompass any unintended change to the system. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are commonly used methods as they can detect large changes in nucleic acid copy number (>2-fold) and can confirm the presence/absence of an intended change within a cell, as well as informing on off-target effects. 15 unctional characterization of the biological system is achieved by measurement of the genetic product, most commonly by the detection of fluorescent protein reporters, in response to the stimulation of the gene circuit.",

Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that integrates concepts and techniques from biology, engineering, computer science, and molecular biology. It is typically defined as the redesign or engineering of existing biological components and systems using specific technologies to achieve a desired function [157] . In 2010, Gibson et al. created the first synthetic genomic cell, employing a bottom-up approach in which chemically synthesized DNA fragments were assembled to form a minimal genome necessary for the basic functioning of an organism [158] . This minimal genome offers advantages in stability and efficiency, but challenges remain, such as the difficulty of synthesizing long DNA sequences from scratch [159] . In contrast, the field of engineered bacteria often adopts a top-down strategy, which involves modifying existing organisms by removing non-essential genes from their genomes. This process frees up space and energy to optimize the expression of target genes [160] . For example, studies have shown that heterologous protein production in Lactobacillus lactis NZ9000 is significantly improved when 2.83% of the non-essential genome is deleted using the Cre-loxP deletion system [161] . Plasmid-based expression systems are commonly used in engineered bacteria, but they face limitations for clinical applications due to issues with genetic instability and the potential for biological contamination. As a result, gene-editing technologies, particularly those based on the CRISPR-Cas system, are emerging as powerful tools. These technologies have the potential to stabilize and modify probiotic genomes, enabling the alteration of their metabolic pathways and biological properties for more precise and reliable applications. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas system is an acquired immune mechanism found in most archaea and approximately half of all bacteria, where it functions to recognize and excise invading viral DNA [162] . This system consists of two main components: the sequence responsible for encoding Cas-related proteins and the CRISPR array, which contains a series of repeats interspersed with spacer sequences. The spacer sequences store fragments of foreign genetic material, allowing the organism to \"remember\" previous invaders [163] .",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is an enabling technology that aims to increase predictive capacity and reconcile complexity in biological systems. This field generally applies rational engineering principles, usually framed around the ubiquitous Design-Build-Test(-Learn) cycle, to rapidly develop gain-of-function in living systems. The Design-Build-Test cycle represents the primary three cogs which accelerate the translation of an idea into a product, application or cellular gain of function (Figure 3). Although several definitions exist, synthetic biology may be defined simply as the engineering of biology; incorporating principles and tools such as orthogonality, modularity, automation, standardisation, robustness and a strong emphasis on rational design [31]. Largely driven by technological advances in DNA synthesis, corresponding decreases in cost, advances in computational methods and the elucidation of complex metabolic pathways, synthetic biology has significantly advanced our ability to produce complex natural products in yeast. This section briefly summarises several synthetic biology approaches that may be used to improve biopharmaceutical production in yeast. This topic has previously been reviewed in greater depth [16]. Due to the inherent codon bias between different organisms, a common approach is to re-code genes (synonymous recoding) to improve translation efficiency. For instance, it was demonstrated that the recoding of the Igk chain protein from mouse (Mus musculus) for production in S. cerevisiae led to a 50-fold increase in protein yield [32]. It should be noted that other dimensions of codon bias do exist, and matching codon usage to general tRNA abundance may not necessarily impart the highest yield (reviewed in greater depth [33]). For example, it may be beneficial to optimise codon usage to genes expressed under the specific condition of interest, such as those expressed highly during stationary-phase growth, pH, carbon source or respiration amongst others [34]. Several iterations of the same gene may therefore be required to optimise yield. \n\nA powerful approach used in synthetic biology is the application of modularity. The commonlyapplied Golden Gate assembly method uses Type IIS restriction enzymes for modular one-pot DNA assembly [35], and may be used to rapidly construct and screen promoter-gene pairs to identify the optimal configuration for gene expression.",

            "text": "Recent advances in synthetic biology have greatly expanded the capacity to improve pathway performance and cellular phenotype. The design, use, and importation of constructed genetic control elements, optimized genes, and functional genetic circuits can be used to modulate the function of metabolic pathways. The modularity and hierarchy of parts, devices, systems, and chassis provide a framework for studying and controlling cellular functions. Moreover, synthetic biology provides an interface where protein engineering, directed evolution, DNA synthesis, and in silico design can direct the field of metabolic engineering. Many of these advances are influencing how scientists and engineers view and perturb cellular systems. Perhaps the paramount application of these tools is in the arena of microbial biotechnology where the overarching goal is to rewire cellular systems for biochemical production. This task is quite complex given the complexity and interconnectedness of metabolism and regulation. Synthetic biology approaches provide a way to both intervene in as well as bypass cellular complexities. \n \nThis special issue contains six review articles that highlight two major aspects of synthetic biology: (1) general design principles and modeling of synthetic biology and (2) applications of synthetic biology to biochemical and biofuels production. The articles are ordered based on these two areas. In the first class, review articles describe the basic paradigm of synthetic biology and include the design and modeling of systems. \n \nIn the first article, E. Young and H. Alper discuss the areas of synthetic biology within a process engineering paradigm, through a three-tiered model that uses the central dogma of biology as a pivot. The first tier comprises the units of the central dogma and the possible flows between them (DNA, transcription, RNA, translation, and protein), the second tier includes intrinsic interactions between these units by means of regulatory mechanisms, and the third tier comprises external or environmental influences on the units. This conceptualization permits engineering approaches in synthetic biology to be classified by which components they influence. The authors provide several examples to illustrate how synthetic biology approaches can be combined toward realizing the goal of integrative synthetic biology, which the authors exemplify with two examples from the literature. \n \nIn the second article, Fritz et al. discuss a \u201cbiology by design\u201d paradigm, which involves the conceptualization, design, and construction of a synthetic biological system, followed by the expectation that the system will perform as desired.

Various bio-tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9), optimization of ribosomal binding sites and novel genetic elements have been introduced in recent years. These bio-tools can promote the biosynthesis of various natural biomaterials, reduce the cost, and adjust their physical properties. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 tools, especially the CRISPRi systems, have been used successfully to control the biosynthetic flux of the PHA pathway and adjust the molecular weights and composition of the products. By simultaneously manipulating multiple genes in E. coli via CRISPRi, expressions of the prpC gene encoding 2-methylcitrate synthase can be changed to regulate the 3-hydroxyvalerate content in P(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) copolymers from less than 1 to 13% [81] and generate P34HB with 1.4 to 18.4 mol% of 4HB [82]. \n\nSimilarly, the molecular weight of HA was increased by decreasing the expression of FtsZ (initiating cell division) and changing the distribution of cardiolipin in the membrane of Bacillus subtilis [83]. The CRISPR-Cas9-initiated fixed-point strategy was employed to successfully incorporate spider silk protein genes into the Bombyx mori genome, resulting in fibers that are as strong as native spider silk, with a high tensile strength of 1.2 GPa [84]. \n\nUsing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the function of endogenous genes was disrupted in BM-N cells with a mutation frequency of 30 -40%. Similarly, zinc-finger nucleases have been used to insert the human lysozyme gene into the bovine \u03b2-casein locus, leading to human lysozyme knock-in in approximately 1% of the treated bovine fetal fibroblasts.",

            "text": "Synthetic Biology as a design and engineering discipline of biologically based parts, devices and systems has the potential to deliver important new applications [23][24][25], that will improve existing industrial processes [26][27][28][29][30] and advance the design of genetic devices that provide novel treatment strategies for future gene-and cell-based therapies [31,32]. The ability to rapidly program biological functions through streamlined DNA fabrication methods is one of the key technological drivers of innovation in synthetic biology [33]. With recent advances in lowcost DNA manufacturing, what limits the progress of synthetic biology is no longer the scale of gene synthesis but difficulties to efficiently build longer DNA designs that encompass dozens to hundreds of genes for genome-scale biological programs [34,35]. \n\nCurrently, the majority of available software tools streamline FASTA sequences of individual genes with most of them focusing on optimization yields for recombinant protein expression [36,37], rather than DNA synthesis optimization per se. Here, we have applied the concept of retrosynthesis, a technique for planning and optimizing chemical synthesis routes of complex organic molecules on the partitioning of genome-scale DNA constructs. In so doing, the Genome Partitioner algorithm conceptually decomposes genome-scale DNA designs into simpler building units for the synthesis of which standardized DNA ligation and amplification techniques are known. Thereby, one gradually obtains shorter DNA building blocks, which are ultimately in the size range accessible by low-cost de novo DNA synthesis. This process leads to a tree-like design allowing standardized bottom-up genome assembly of genome-scale DNA designs that begins with a panel of several hundreds, sequence-verified 1 kb DNA subblocks. Finally, the Genome Partition algorithm is not intended to assist in the biological design process of DNA parts. However, the standardized GenBank file format used by the Genome Partitioner is compatible with synthetic biology software tools that do support such biological design [38]. It is important to note that standardization of adaptor sequences is key for streamlined part assembly. As a consequence, internal type IIs restriction sites within the DNA design have to be removed upon synonymous recoding for which several DNA design software tools can be used [13,14,[39][40][41].",

            "text": "The historical development of systems and synthetic biology tools enabled a transition from methods exclusively available for model organisms to their expansion to non-canonical microbial species (Fig. 3). The advent of omics technologies in the 1990s and early 2000s enabled the systematic investigation of living systems as a whole, leading to the emergence of systems biology as a standalone discipline 56 . This has been facilitated by using model organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae. In fact, as these species are abundant human commensals 57 , they have been used as models in biology since the first half of the 20th century 58 . Therefore, they represented ideal platforms around which to develop system biology tools, as our understanding of their genetics and physiology was already quite advanced. \n\nThe field of genetic engineering is considered to have started in the 1970s with the first recombinant DNA technologies. In particular, this decade was pivotal for reaching important milestones in molecular biology, such as the use of restriction enzymes, DNA recombination, and DNA sequencing 59 . The genome editing revolution brought on by CRISPR-based genetic engineering in the mid 2010s 60 significantly accelerated the synthetic biology revolution. This breakthrough was also initiated in the two abovementioned model species, with first landmark works on the topic published in the early 2010s 61,62 . From that moment onwards, scientists have been able to investigate and engineer biological systems in an unprecedented way, expanding the use of CRISPR-Cas tools also to non-model species 39,40,63,64 (Fig. 3). \n\nBoth E. coli and S. cerevisiae rely on a polytrophic lifestyle. Therefore, exploiting those organisms for method development has clear advantages, as it relies on energetic carbon feedstocks, which enable fast growth and hence increase the speed of technological development. Moreover, since the dawn of molecular biology, many genetic elements (e.g. plasmids, origin of replications, promoters, ribosome binding sites, etc.) have been characterized for these species. All this caused the establishment and validation of most new protocols and genetic engineering approaches using these organisms. Conversely, newly isolated microorganisms pose a challenge in terms of genetic manipulation and have much less characterized genetic parts.",

As mentioned earlier, bio synthesis of bacterial polymers requires the engagement of complex cellular processes from gene expression to provision of enzymes and proteins, central metabolism, and regulatory and signalling systems leading to intra cellular assembly or secretion across the cell envelope. Hence, design of cell factories for production of novel biopolymers requires integration of the complexity of cellular and metabolic process and extensive experimen tation to combine the relevant genetic information. DNA foundries use advanced software, robotic and analyti cal approaches to allow automated 'design-build-test' engineering cycles for the highthroughput development of desired cell factories through synthetic assembly of genetic elements. DNA foundries have higher experi mental consistency and lower costs than manual oper ations. Furthermore, modular genetic elements, such as promoters, terminators, ribosomebinding sites, orthog onal polymerases, untranslated regions, signal peptides, putative stabilization modules, genetic effectors and protein folding enhancers, provide a dynamic plat form to tune gene expression and protein production. \n\nStriking advancements include the introduction of inducible and/or controllable genetic switches, such as T7 polymerasebased expression systems 121 , pro grammable T7based synthetic transcription fac tors 122 , the riboTite system 123 , vector engineering 124 and CriSPr-Cas 125 tools, to allowed finetuned expression of endogenous or heterologous genes. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9 has been successfully used to simultane ously manipulate several genes. CriSPr interference has been successfully used to redirect metabolic flux towards Intermediates of central metabolism are diverted towards the provision of precursors for polymer synthesis. Four general mechanisms for the production of polysaccharides in bacteria are shown.",

            "text": "Efficient genetic modification technology and mature genetic manipulation tools greatly facilitate the development of cell factories. As an important industrial microorganism, A. oryzae has attracted widespread attention from researchers due to its complete genome sequence, powerful secretion of proteins, and increasingly mature synthetic biology tools [79,95]. This review has provided an overview of prevalent synthetic biology tools, genetic engineering methodologies, and heterologous expression systems used for A. oryzae. However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed. \n\n(1) DNA assembly is one of the limiting factors for the rapid development of a synthetic biology toolkit for A. oryzae, overcoming limitations associated with long or multiple fragments and scarred DNA after ligation. Enhanced cloning strategies and DNA assembly techniques are essential for the swift construction of gene expression cassettes. Recently, several biotechnology methods for the genetic modification of filamentous fungi, such as the Modular Cloning system or the Golden Braid-based Fungal Braid system, have been used to assemble strains more quickly in a standardized and modular manner. These methods have potential application value in A. oryzae [96,97]. In the future, it is necessary to vigorously develop improved cloning strategies and DNA assembly techniques, to enable faster and more efficient construction of multiple gene expression cassettes. (2) Promoters and terminators are the most important basic elements in synthetic biology research. To date, several gene expression control elements available for A. oryzae have been identified. However, compared with the model microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such elements are still rare. It is necessary to construct promoters with shorter sequences, stronger functions, and wider ranges of transcriptional activity to further explore new synthetic biological elements. (3) Gene editing technology has accomplished rapid editing of A. oryzae with the advantages of simplicity, high efficiency, and high specificity and accelerated the development of engineered strains. CRISPR/Cas9 systems must address off-target effects and improve the efficiency and enhancement of the efficiency of precisely targeted editing, among other aspects.",

The combination of new design strategies, models, software and measurement methods, 174 along with new orthogonal and burden-responsive genetic parts, means that a researcher building a 175 new construct for a desired task can now use a plethora of new tools to improve the predictability 176 and health of the final living synthetic system. This is especially important for bacterial synthetic 177 biology, where many downstream applications require engineered cells to grow robustly in large 178 volumes and in changing environments without failing due to stresses and subsequent mutations. 179\n\nAs we move forward, our ability to predict and exploit the many interactions between host 180 cells and synthetic construct will improve further as our systems-level understanding of bacterial 181 cells improves. Next-generation whole-cell models with sufficient detail to capture global effects like 182 resource use, as well as specific issues like protein function, will undoubtedly improve predictability, 183 engineering efficiency and complexity. In parallel, more extensive characterisation of different 184 constructs in different cells and varied conditions should give a deeper understanding of the host-185 construct interactions and the limits of our current abilities to predict performance. Synthetic 186 biology has so far had an over-reliance on using GFP and multiwell plates to grow and measure 187 everything, so new characterisation approaches and more application-relevant growth conditions 188 are a priority for the future. And while some of the greatest achievements in synthetic biology in 189 recent years have been in producing the many new orthogonal parts that now allow more complex 190 constructs, perhaps the greatest achievements of the next decade will come from engineering host 191 cells to provide a set of orthogonal resources for their synthetic constructs, so that the host and 192 construct can be made to benefit one another. Experimental results in Ceroni et al. [27] showed that GFP production from a genomically-encoded 228 capacity monitor (green circle) acts as a proxy measure for resource availability in bacteria.",

            "text": "transformation efficiency, synthetic biology has made enormous strides in plant biology research. \n\nDespite being a relatively new field of research, synthetic biology has enabled the discovery of multiple new chemicals, exploration of advanced protein expression regulation, and production of novel high-value proteins like biopharmaceuticals within chloroplasts. These advancements in chloroplast biotechnology have been discussed in seminal reviews (Bock, 2015;Boehm and Bock, 2019). New research that is enabling chloroplast biotechnology includes the ability to monitor the expression of proteins in vivo through a luciferase reporter (Matsuo et al., 2006), gene activation can be enabled through a site-specific recombinase (Tungsuchat-Huang et al., 2011), a synthetic riboswitch (Verhounig et al., 2010), and metabolic pathway engineering is possible through synthetic multigene operons (Lu et al., 2013). These approaches may, in the future, be used in combination with nanotechnology approaches within diverse wild-type plants, for which currently there are no transformation and genome modification protocols available. Containing these new molecular and genetic regulatory mechanisms and proteins are possible through chloroplast biotechnology. As shown in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, codon reassignment allows an additional avenue for biocontainment (Young and Purton, 2016). Biocontainment within chloroplasts may allow researchers to rapidly and specifically produce proteins within wild-type strains at specific time periods for a better understanding of nuclear-chloroplast protein expression and regulation. In addition, synthetic biology may be further enabled by a chloroplast transformation with large mutant libraries for the entire plastid genome. Facile in vivo assembly of chloroplast transformation vectors have been developed for plastid engineering (Wu et al., 2017a). The first fully exogenous plastid transformation has been completed in C. reinhardtii (O'Neill et al., 2012). The in situ ability of nanotechnology DNA delivery may enable new directed evolution approaches to screen large mutant libraries.",

One of the most powerful tools in synthetic biology is the small, customizable, and modular protein\u2013protein interaction domains, which is used to regulate a wide variety of processes within mammalian cells. Here we review designed coiled coil dimers that represent a set of heterodimerization domains with many advantages. These dimers have been useful for directing the localization of selected proteins within cells, enhancing chemical or light-regulated transcription, creating fast proteolysis-based responsive systems and protein secretion, genome editing, and cell\u2013cell interaction motifs. Additionally, we will discuss how these building blocks are used in diverse applications, such as CAR T cell regulation and genome editing. Finally, we will look at the potential for future advances in synthetic biology using these building modules.",

            "text": "The pioneering work of Cohen and Boyer in recombinant DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) technology [1] gave birth to genetic engineering and the biotechnology industry. The related Cohen-Boyer patents [2][3][4] that protected the technology played a stellar role in the rapid rise of the biotechnology industry [5,6]. The next landmark was the creation of a bacterial cell controlled by a chemically synthesized genome by Craig Venter and his group in 2010 [7]. More recently, Floyd Romesberg and colleagues in 2014 [8] reported the creation of a semisynthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet that has raised both hope and fear [9]. The new letters in the alphabet are artificially created nucleotides not found in Nature. Along with these breakthroughs, the great promise of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), and in particular CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology pioneered by Feng Zhang in 2012 [10] as a new way of making precise, targeted changes to the genome of a cell or an organism (see Section 2.3) has set the stage for major advances in synthetic biology, which aims to design and construct new biological parts, novel artificial biological pathways, organisms or devices and systems including the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. \n\nResearchers are now focussing on developing tools and methods that would enable them to encode, in artificially created or natural DNA, basic genetic functions in novel combinations by design. The aim is to artificially create biological systems of increasing size, complexity, and tailored functionality. Currently synthesis capabilities far exceed design capabilities in the sense that we know how to build but not yet with clarity what to build [11]. Synthesis capabilities are developing at a pace where DNA synthesis can be automated and the desired DNA produced once the sequence is provided to vendors. This integration of biology and traditional engineering is occurring so rapidly, it appears likely that a couple of decades hence researchers may begin producing synthetic organisms that can produce not only pharmaceutical products but also industrial products such as bio-fuels on a commercial scale. Possible socio-economic benefits from synthetic biology research is thus enormous, but then so is the possibility of the technology's misuse.",

            "text": "The approaches presented above provide an overview of what is currently possible with well characterised IB platforms, and how a synthetic biology approach would augment both the range and amount of compounds that could be produced, and the rate of progress. For C. reinhardtii, although our ability to manipulate it genetically is advancing rapidly, many limitations remain for effective metabolic engineering. For example, fewer than 100 protein-coding genes from the C. reinhardtii genome have been functionally validated, compared with the approximately 6800 genes that have been characterised experimentally in Arabidopsis thaliana (Koornneef et al., 2004). Additionally, the number of tools to regulate transgene expression (Tables 2  and 3) is small compared with standard IB hosts. There are also the well known complications of integration of transgenes into the nucleus via non-homologous end joining, and extensive gene silencing. A significant additional challenge is the fact that regulatory networks at the genetic, cellular, and metabolic levels in C. reinhardtii are almost completely unexplored, so that attempts at manipulation will be effectively empirical, whereas there are many studies of the interactome of E. coli (Juan et al., 2008) and S. cerevisiae (Ito et al., 2001). Although undoubtedly some of these knowledge gaps for C. reinhardtii will be filled in the near future (as discussed above), it should be noted that no biological chassis evolved to be optimal for scientific research, with extensive engineering required to create today's E. coli strains for routine protein expression (Goel et al., 2012;Buchholz and Collins, 2013). Thus rather than waiting for this to be true for C. reinhardtii, would it be possible to expedite progress by applying current leading concepts, techniques and technologies from synthetic biology? This might lead to quicker solutions to current research questions and, importantly, provide the opportunity to develop C. reinhardtii production systems that exceed the capacity of current metabolic engineering approaches. Adopting standardisation, modularity, and design/testing does not require drastic changes in approach, nor does it render all prior knowledge obsolete. Instead this progression can be achieved by subtle changes to minimise experimental variables and standardise workflows, creating a cycle of perpetual improvement. To demonstrate this, let",

Moreover, researchers have adapted microorganisms to produce antimicrobial peptides to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. For instance, Lactobacillus species have been engineered to detect multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium and release antimicrobial peptides against it. This highlights the immense potential of targeted microbial therapies [74]. \n\nFurthermore, synthetic biology has significantly improved the efficiency of pharmaceutical production by enabling the precise regulation of metabolic pathways and the optimization of genetic circuits. For example, data-driven models integrated with CRISPR-Cas systems have been successfully applied to reprogram metabolic fluxes in yeast, significantly enhancing the production of bioactive compounds [75]. This achievement exemplifies the successful integration of computational methods and advanced genetic editing technologies for designing and optimizing synthetic pathways, demonstrating great potential for the scalable biomanufacturing of pharmaceuticals. \n\nSynthetic biology has enabled the reprogramming of microorganisms for the production of therapeutic compounds and other applications. By integrating chemical sensors with metabolic pathways, engineered microbes can detect specific molecules and dynamically regulate production efficiency. For instance, sensor-effector systems allow the real-time control of bioactive compound synthesis, facilitating the scaling of pharmaceutical production while maintaining precision and productivity [76]. These innovations highlight the critical role of synthetic biology in advancing microbial engineering. \n\nThe costs associated with research and development in synthetic biology have significantly increased in recent years.

Such investment levels highlight the rapid growth of synthetic biology and its establishment as a strategic direction in biotechnology.

            "text": "Recent developments in synthetic biology and gene editing technologies have created new possibilities to control cell behavior through the engineering of genetic networks that respond to environmental stimuli. Synthetic biology involves the design and assembly of genetic circuits to create new biological functions. By understanding the native genetic circuits that are usually optimized via evolution and reconstructing them from modular design, bioengineers can use synthetic biology to build systems with novel activity. 4 In the early stage of synthetic biology, simple gene circuits could be built to be precisely executed to recapitulate patterns of certain natural biological systems in bacteria, such as oscillating gene expression networks, multistate toggle switches, logic computation, and intercellular signaling networks. 24,31,38 Following these early successes, significant progress has been made, such as new modular genetic parts with standardized design and connectivity principles to streamline the construction of novel circuits with greater complexity. 47,73 However, most of the early success of synthetic biology is performed in prokaryotic cells, while it remains difficult to directly transfer the methods into eukaryotic cells due to the complexity of the genetic networks. With the discovery of more precise genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, researchers have begun to interrogate and control gene function and network dynamics in eukaryotic cells. 75 CRISPR/ Cas9 allows precise targeting of specific genome loci. When genetically engineered to pair with functional domains, this precise control has enabled the construction of multilayered gene circuits with higher-order functions in mammalian cells. 55,66 Applying synthetic biology and gene editing in mammalian cells, researchers can now control the stem cell differentiation process and even reprogram somatic cells toward pluripotency or other cell types. Recent research has utilized tools and principles from synthetic biology to recreate natural developmental processes or engineer cell fate in precise ways. Previously, it was shown that ectopic overexpression of transcription factors could reprogram one cell type into another. 107 Transcription factors are considered the master regulators of cell-type specification and can be used to program cell fate decisions. 23 However, this method of overexpressing transcription factors for reprogramming relies on the ectopic expression of randomly inserted genes that can limit the efficiency and kinetics of generating the desired cell type. Consequently, several groups have utilized tools and approaches from synthetic",

The challenges arising from the inherent complexity of biological systems can be addressed using engineering strategies of standardization, decoupling and abstraction. 18,19 Organisms are broken down into a hierarchy of composable parts, which can subsequently be assembled in a biological milieu. In this process, synthetic biological components are created by adding, removing or changing genes and proteins. 19 By coupling gene regulatory networks with biosensor modules and biological response systems, new functions can be obtained. A plethora of research has been conducted on the sensor applications of many different organisms from fungi, algae, yeast and bacteria to tissue culture cells. Synthetic biologists aim at moving engineered biomolecular networks into the application stage and progress can be observed, for example, in biosensing, therapeutics and the production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals. 18 umerous standardized parts for the genetic engineering of Escherichia coli exist. 20 he international Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) is providing an extremely valuable contribution to the development of a library of standardized biological parts known as BioBricks. 21 These are building blocks used to design and assemble larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts. Mascher et al. 9,10 created the Bacillus BioBrick Box to enable standardized work with the Gram-positive, spore-forming model organism Bacillus subtilis. They have established well-characterized genetic building blocks as a foundation for the convenient and reproducible assembly of novel genetic modules and devices. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an increasingly attractive host for synthetic biology. Dueber et al. 22 present a versatile engineering platform for yeast, which contains a rapid, modular assembly method and a basic set of characterized parts. Advantages of yeast in a biosensor are established procedures for longterm storage in a dried state, an extensive genetic toolkit and a non-threatening public perception. 23",

            "text": "Metabolic engineering often involves the overexpression of multiple genes and, less commonly, the suppression or knockout of genes to reduce their activity. Until about half a decade ago, RNA interference (RNAi) was the preferred method for silencing genes. However, advancements in genome editing tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPRassociated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) and related systems, now enable precise modification of genes and their regulatory elements (Figure 1C, Table 3). CRISPR technology directs the Cas9 protein to target and cleave  (Bhambhani et al., 2022;Das et al., 2024;Pickar-Oliver & Gersbach, 2019). Advanced gene assembly techniques and vector systems, such as Golden Gate cloning (using type IIS restriction enzymes) and Gibson assembly, facilitate seamless integration of large, multi-gene constructs, making them ideal for reconstructing complex metabolic pathways in plants (Sonawane et al., 2016;Sorida & Bonasio, 2023). Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have reduced synthesis costs and enhanced sequence fidelity, offering new alternatives for producing large gene constructs in synthetic biology (Hughes & Ellington, 2017). Self-replicating viral vectors, like geminiviral replicons, have been used to enhance transient expression in N. benthamiana, boosting the production of target metabolites. The adoption of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering tools, such as synthetic promoter design and optimized expression vectors, allows for precise regulation of gene expression, adjusting pathway fluxes (Ali & Kim, 2019;Brooks et al., 2023;Cai et al., 2020;Jores et al., 2021;Selma et al., 2023;Tian et al., 2022). \n\nResearchers combine synthetic and systems biology to advance the development of synthetic genetic circuits and chimeric pathways with enzymes from different species.

            "text": "As with its sister field of systems biology, synthetic biology is perhaps best described not by what you do, but how you do it. From this perspective, one way of summarizing synthetic biology is by its intended goal of making biological systems explicitly tractable through careful modularization of biology [1]. In this vein, the core emphases in synthetic biology are synthesis, abstraction, and standardization of biological components [2]. Synthesis refers to the generation of modular, reusable biological parts (normally as DNA). Abstraction refers to the implementation of synthesized parts by function rather than composition (e.g., \"this is a promoter\" rather than \"this is ttgacagctagctcagtcctaggtataatgctagc\") and can facilitate the design of more complex biological devices and systems. One of the hallmarks of this approach is the push for standardization where all synthesized parts and devices are characterized, reproducible, and interchangeable. \n\nAlthough nascent, the approach employed in synthetic biology is already making significant contributions in areas within biological engineering and basic biological research by providing a rigorous framework for building biological systems from the ground-up [3]. Progress in synthetic biology is providing the concepts and tools to develop biological engineering as an application of biology, just as chemical engineering is an application of chemistry. Although the scope of applied synthetic biology is wide, including areas that are \"beyond the bioreactor\" such as bioremediation, agriculture, and human health [4], it is apparent that many of the applications of synthetic biology that will materialize in the near future are in metabolic engineering [5]. In this context, the synthetic biology approach aims to generate scalable, reusable genetic parts for controlling genetically encoded unit operations (e.g., enzymes, transporters), for the predictable design and construction of metabolic pathways [6]. \n\nSince its inception, made possible by the advent of recombinant DNA technology and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the goal of metabolic engineering has been to optimize cellular metabolism for a particular process application-often through extensive genetic modification.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology applies GE principles to design and alter natural systems or artificially construct biological devices and systems with predictable behaviors (83,121). CRISPR-mediated gene editing is a synthetic biology extension of current GE paradigms and is already proving useful for conferring various resistance traits to crops. Looking beyond gene editing, the redesign of simple genetic parts, usually as single components in a construct, such as promoters, has been the most frequent embodiment of synthetic biology. At its core, synthetic biology should be capable of endowing extensive and transformative changes to organisms by leveraging advanced computational design to build synthetic DNA constructs and then large-scale installation of many genetic components into plant genomes at once or in series. Analogous to the DNA sequencing revolution that has enabled reading genomic DNA, the emerging DNA synthesis revolution allows for unprecedented scales of writing DNA into genomes. \n\nIn Sc2.0 (http://syntheticyeast.org), the most ambitious synthetic biology program with a eukaryotic organism to date, each chromosome of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is being synthesized and inserted into the genome piece by piece (24,114). The goal is to create the first synthetic genome within a complex organism. This stepwise rebuilding of a complete genome elucidates an unprecedented understanding of the organism and its fundamental biology, raising immense prospects for rewriting genomes. Advances in synthetic biology may enable the design, building, and installation of a synthetic genome into plants (or even a chromosome or subgenome) to confer pest resistance or for other practical uses in agriculture. Indeed, writing large amounts of synthetic DNA into plants has natural precedence in the form of viruses, such as caulimovirus and geminivirus, that exist episomally and add information to plant genomes. \n\nThe most amenable subgenome in plants for synthetic engineering is the plastid genome, and the expanding list of crop plants with engineered plastids currently includes soybean, lettuce, and potato. Given that the plant kingdom excels in producing a wide range of biochemicals, it follows that the blueprints for endowing crops with new defense chemicals exist in nature.",

            "text": "The development and standardization of biological parts (DNA or RNA fragments) to reliably achieve a predictable output in living organisms has been an often-emphasized aspect of synthetic biology [1]. Remarkable progress has been achieved in characterization of bacterial promoters [2], transcriptional terminators [3], insulators [4], translation optimization [5] and promoter inducibility [6], however advances on a higher level of systems' complexity have not been as forthcoming [7][8][9] and major synthetic biology applications (e.g. [10][11][12][13][14]) were achieved by a host of sophisticated and custom-developed genetic engineering [15,16]. \n\nNevertheless, standardized biological parts are particularly well suited to use in an educational context, as they emphasize utility and remove complexities associated with protocol development [17][18][19]. These advantages are best illustrated by the BioBuilder lessons, which provide detailed protocols that combine lab-based experiments with engineering tasks to demonstrate fundamental principles of biological and electronic circuits [20] (https://biobuilder.org/), and the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition (iGEM), where thousands of students worldwide create synthetic biology designs and constructs based on and inspired by a set of DNA parts provided by the iGEM Foundation [21]. Notably, practical synthetic biology exemplified by building novel biological constructs from compatible genetic parts, favour active learning approaches in teaching, which were shown to improve students' academic attainment [22,23]. \n\nTo expand the availability of education-friendly resources for synthetic biology we developed unigems, a set of plasmids with simple features such as strong and weak constitutive promoters or single-and dual-inducible promoters and an olfactory construct that can be used directly in laboratory classes. In addition, each plasmid can be split into functional parts that can be exchanged either between the plasmids or replaced with novel parts with PCR and Gibson assembly.",

Who would deny that they were generated based on the rational combination of \"biological parts\" with known function (i.e. regulatory DNA-elements and DNA sequences encoding proteins/protein domains) or even by constructing new \"parts\" (if we think of the hybrid transcriptional regulators made of viral and bacterial protein domains that confer tetracycline-control to mammalian cells [7]) -and that they have generated new functions? A similar overlap and coupling to synthetic biology has been recently proposed by Nielsen and Kiesling [8] for metabolic engineering (the metabolic analysis and genetic engineering of cells for improving an designing metabolic pathways). Between traditional approaches, that only increase the pathway flux towards a desired product by directed genetic modifications in a naturally producing strain, and synthetic biology's envisioned generation of complete synthetic cells designed to produce the desired product, there would be approaches that use concepts of both traditional metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. These would involve using cells that normally do not produce a product of interest, but which are able to do so after being equipped with a \"synthetic\" pathway -though initially often in small amounts only. In a second step, the flux through the pathway is then increased by traditional metabolic engineering [8]. \n\nSynthetic genomics has been defined as the engineering and manipulation of an organism's genetic material on the scale of the whole genome, based on technologies to design and chemically synthesize pieces of DNA and to assemble them to long, chromosome-sized fragments [9,10]. These can serve as entire genomes of viruses or bacteria [11,12]. Compared with traditional genetic engineering, where typically only very few nucleotides or genes in an organism are altered (mostly based on recombinant DNA technology), synthetic genomics thus allows to simultaneously change a large number of nucleotides or gene loci all over the genome by gene synthesis.",

            "text": "Microbial expression systems have been delivering wide varieties of high-quality recombinant proteins in a scalable and cost-effective manner. While incompatibility between microbial translation machineries and eukaryotic protein architecture presents a serious setback to heterologous protein expression, new discoveries and engineering strategies have been put forward to circumvent the problems. Today, catalogs of highly specialized microbial chassis are available for the functional expression of recombinant proteins with specific structural and biochemical demands (Table 1). Despite the efforts, the complex interplay of cellular physiology and recombinant expression pathways still renders the optimization of protein expression a highly challenging task. Recent advances in the systems-level understanding of cellular expression machineries and the wealth of transcriptomic and proteomic data together present an alternative scheme that could possibly mitigate the bottlenecks in recombinant protein expression. \n\nThe shared perspectives of systems and synthetic biology fostered an emerging idea that cells can be made simpler and more efficient by eliminating components of the genome deemed unnecessary for survival. Indeed, precisely designed genome reductions have consistently led to enhanced cellular features including genomic stability, growth rate, biomass, protein productivity, and genetic pliability (more amenable to genetic engineering) in the target microbial cells. For the most part, an increasing number of existing microbial chassis have been genome-streamlined to resolve some of the bottlenecks in heterologous protein expression and to further optimize their performance. Two opposing approaches exist for the construction of reduced genome strains: top-down genome reduction and bottom-up genome synthesis. Despite the shared goal, the two opposing approaches essentially differ with respect to their area of expertise. While the top-down genome reduction offers a pragmatic approach to further improve the functionality of existing cell factories, the current status of the bottom-up synthesis is more inclined toward understanding the fundamental aspects of the minimal genome. Although it is said that the bottom-up genome synthesis may provide new ground to synthesize non-natural proteins for medicinal use, the underlying cost and time to build one such",

Since then enormous steps have been made to improve protein titers and to expand the range of possible proteins to be produced. The development of genetic modification tools and improved ease of use of cloning strategies have played an important role in this. The time to construct a strain and develop a cost-effective bioprocess has decreased significantly. Concurrently, sequencing data, which serve as a library for donor genes to be overexpressed, have increased exponentially. Therefore, the speed and flexibility to engineer custom-made protein factories has improved tremendously during the last decades. As in any developed technology, a certain degree of standardization is desired. In order to make this ambition more tangible the concept of cell factories is often used. This concept is based on the principle that the cell factory should be able to produce any protein to a certain desired level. Based on the concept of standardized expression vectors and expression hosts the basics of this cell factory concept were built. However, in reality this concept proved to be far too simple, as a standardized input does not result in a standardized output. This is caused by the immense complexity and dynamics of cellular systems. Even when all components are described, by sequencing the genome, the interaction, compartmentalization and dynamics of these components are largely unknown. A striking example is the difference between homologous protein expression which are produced to levels up to 50 g/l in filamentous fungi whereas heterologous proteins are produced at levels which are usually 100-1000 fold less 1. So even when identical tools are used in a standardized approach the final result can vary over several orders of magnitude.",

Synthetic chromosomes (Gibson et al., 2009(Gibson et al., , 2010Kosuri et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2012;Hutchison et al., 2016) and multiplex automated genome engineering (Wang et al., 2009(Wang et al., , 2012Isaacs et al., 2011;Lajoie et al., 2013;Rovner et al., 2015) have also been developed by utilizing the synthetic biology toolboxes.\n\nThe reach of synthetic biology-mediated genome engineering has been significant in a wide range of organisms that currently include bacteria, viruses, yeast, Drosophila, zebrafish, and mammalian cells (Cong et al., 2013;DiCarlo et al., 2013;Hwang et al., 2013;Jiang et al., 2013;Mali et al., 2013;Port et al., 2014;Ren et al., 2014;Hisano et al., 2015;Jako\u010diunas et al., 2015;Zhu et al., 2015;Singh et al., 2017Singh et al., , 2018. With increasing global awareness of health, energy, and environmental issues, prioritizing the exploration and application of synthetic biology has become inevitable, given the potential options that these new sciences could offer. Recent advances in synthetic biology tools have extended their use in basic sciences, biomedical sciences, biotechnology, and industries. This expansion and development become particularly useful for accelerating the invention and innovation in the field of synthetic biology.\n\nThe daunting complexity and barrier rendered by the cell membrane prompt numerous difficulties, such as experiment being hard to standardize, incompatibility issues, and variability. To address these issues, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems, also known as in vitro protein synthesis, have emerged as a key tool that can work without the use of living cells. These systems allow one to directly control transcription, translation, and metabolism in an open source fashion (Carlson et al., 2012;Lu, 2017;Moore et al., 2017;Jiang et al., 2018;Yue et al., 2019). CFPS represents a historically important component in the field of biochemistry, duly acknowledging the pioneering effort made by Nobel laureate Eduard",

            "text": "The development of targeted genome editing technologies has opened new prospects for the generation of transgenic animals at a whole new level. The standardization of the generation of transgenic animals with specified and stable target traits is becoming possible thanks to the use of knowledge on the molecular genetic mechanisms of regulation of gene expression and genome functioning, as well as the available technologies of genetic engineering. That is fully applicable to the production of recombinant proteins in milk for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, biologically active additives, etc. \n\nTaking into account the set of technologies generated to date, which are still under active development, the optimal direction of studies in the field of recombinant protein production in the milk of economically important animals points to the creation of animal lines (depending on the need in a target protein -rabbits, sheep, goats, and cows) whose genome is modified by the insertion of sequences for asymmetric directed recombination of the expression cassette into a milk protein-encoding gene (e.g., the \u03b2-casein gene). The promoter, and other regulatory sequences, of this gene will provide a high level of transgene expression. This insertion can be achieved with high efficiency through a microinjection into the oocytes of a genetic construct carrying an expression cassette, together with the corresponding recombinant integrase or its mRNA. These animal lines can be created with previously inaccessible efficiency by means of genome editing technologies us-REVIEWS ing the CRISPR/Cas9 system or its analogues, thanks to the simplicity of implementation and design of this system. At the same time, the technologies of synthetic biology allow one to use mini-genes with artificial introns as a transgene, but not full-length gene copies, to facilitate efficient expression of the transgene and production of the target protein, thus simplifying the design and creation of genetic constructs for transgenesis. \n\nProspects for the development of such a direction in the production of recombinant proteins, primarily for medical needs, are supported by the two marketed drugs that are based on recombinant proteins obtained from the milk of transgenic animals. It should be noted that there is the possibility of producing significant quantities of recombinant proteins at costs substantially lower than those required for production in cellular systems.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is an emerging filed with the development with DNA sequencing technology, DNA recombinant technology, computational biology, and biological engineering. It distinguishes itself from other disciplines in both its approach and its choice of object. Synthetic biology should be considered a hybrid discipline, combining both engineering and science to achieve its goal of engineering synthetic organisms. The aim of this discipline for producing a genetic product in a host cell may be not an issue in term of biological parts characterization and DNA assembly, but the modules interfacing in the future. \n\nBiological systems are dynamic, fine regulated, nonlinear complex systems [73]. It possessed a far greater degree of integration of their parts than that of non-living systems. However, the behavior of most synthetic modules has been studied in isolated cells. The function of a synthetic module may fundamentally affect host cell processes, thus altering the cellular context. This situation is further complicated and reprogramming the cell is required, which involves the creation of synthetic biological components by adding, removing, or changing genes or proteins [74]. In the multiply rounds of design, construction, and testing of new cellular components, researchers need to develop feasible and precisely predicted tools and effective methods for module construction. As a result, design of synthetic biological systems has become an iterative process of screening, modeling, construction, and testing that continues until a system achieves the desired behavior. Rational redesign based on mathematical models improves system behavior in such situations. These retooled systems are once again tested experimentally and the process is repeated as needed. Many synthetic biological systems have been engineered successfully in this fashion because the methodology is highly tolerant to uncertainty. Synthetic biology will benefit from further such development and the creation of new methods that manage uncertainty and complexity.",

            "text": "Recent advances in synthetic biology have greatly expanded the capacity to improve pathway performance and cellular phenotype. The design, use, and importation of constructed genetic control elements, optimized genes, and functional genetic circuits can be used to modulate the function of metabolic pathways. The modularity and hierarchy of parts, devices, systems, and chassis provide a framework for studying and controlling cellular functions. Moreover, synthetic biology provides an interface where protein engineering, directed evolution, DNA synthesis, and in silico design can direct the field of metabolic engineering. Many of these advances are influencing how scientists and engineers view and perturb cellular systems. Perhaps the paramount application of these tools is in the arena of microbial biotechnology where the overarching goal is to rewire cellular systems for biochemical production. This task is quite complex given the complexity and interconnectedness of metabolism and regulation. Synthetic biology approaches provide a way to both intervene in as well as bypass cellular complexities. \n\nThis special issue contains six review articles that highlight two major aspects of synthetic biology: (1) general design principles and modeling of synthetic biology and (2) applications of synthetic biology to biochemical and biofuels production. The articles are ordered based on these two areas. In the first class, review articles describe the basic paradigm of synthetic biology and include the design and modeling of systems. \n\nIn the first article, E. Young and H. Alper discuss the areas of synthetic biology within a process engineering paradigm, through a three-tiered model that uses the central dogma of biology as a pivot. The first tier comprises the units of the central dogma and the possible flows between them (DNA, transcription, RNA, translation, and protein), the second tier includes intrinsic interactions between these units by means of regulatory mechanisms, and the third tier comprises external or environmental influences on the units. This conceptualization permits engineering approaches in synthetic biology to be classified by which components they influence. The authors provide several examples to illustrate how synthetic biology approaches can be combined toward realizing the goal of integrative synthetic biology, which the authors exemplify with two examples from the literature. \n\nIn the second article, Fritz et al. discuss a \"biology by design\" paradigm, which involves the conceptualization, design, and construction of a synthetic biological system, followed by the expectation that the system will perform as desired.",

            "text": "This is combined with a number of antibiotic resistance markers and many functional systems at the MCS regions (some examples are shown in the figure). Another exclusive feature of this platform is the existence of a transference origin (oriT) to allow the mobilization of the plasmids to the target bacteria using conjugation (Silva-Rocha et al., 2013). \n\nvectors are still essential tools for many applications. Here, we can emphasize the use of modular vectors for the exploration of genetic functional space in bacteria (Westmann et al., 2018), the functional re-wiring of genetic features and the generation of novel biological functions. The concept of modular vectors has also inspired the development of plasmid collections for specific bacterial hosts such as Pseudomonas putida, Clostridium spp., Cyanobacteria spp., Bacillus spp. and Geobacillus spp. (Heap et al., 2009;Radeck et al., 2013Radeck et al., , 2017;;Silva-Rocha et al., 2013;Taton et al., 2014;Wright et al., 2015;Reeve et al., 2016;Popp et al., 2017), which become essential for establishing novel chassis in synthetic biology. \n\nThus, we have reached a state in which modular vector or high-throughput assembled constructs, from vectors to genomes, can be easily designed and assembled through computational and experimental tools (Casini et al., 2015;Woodruff et al., 2017). However, it is clear that this powerful design and build process was not followed by the standardization of biological parts that ultimately compose those systems (Decoene et al., 2017). The lack of biological information regarding the behaviour of simple genetic features such as promoters, terminators and origins of replication hinders the potential of engineering living organisms. Furthermore, we are currently experiencing the age of emergent phenomena in synthetic biology (P osfai et al., 2006;Kwok, 2010;Chen et al., 2015;Monteiro et al., 2017), an ubiquitous property of life, highlighted decades ago by systems biology (Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999;Kitano, 2002).",

These parts are assembled at Level 1 to create transcriptional units (TUs), which can then be combined at Level 2 to create multigene constructs. Each Level 0 part has unique BsaIgenerated overhangs that define their order within the Level 1 cassette, and Level 2 multigene constructs are organized using unique BsmBI-generated overhangs within the connector sequences.",

            "text": "Biotechnology is poised to bring disruptive innovation across many industries, from energy to healthcare. The size of the industry is estimated to reach $30 trillion by 2030 and could account for more than a third of the global output of manufacturing industries (Candelon et al., 2022 ). Microbial biomanufacturing of chemicals, materials, and biomolecules promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve land use, and bolster sustainability by replacing the products derived from petroleum and ingredients sourced from animals or wild-harvested plants with sustainable alternatives made from renewable feedstocks (Fig. 1 a) (Scown & Keasling, 2022 ). However, doing so requires developing efficient and robust industrial strains capable of producing a wide range of products, from small molecules to proteins, at competitive prices. \n\nCurrently, the majority of commercialized bio-based products are high-value molecules, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), flavors and fragrances, and specialty chemicals supporting relatively small markets. At the same time, most of the opportunity remains untapped primarily due to the inability of biomanufacturing routes to compete with the price points established by the existing production methods. Reaching those profit margins requires extreme strain performance, which is difficult to achieve with traditional strain development approaches (Fig. 1 b). In order to capture the market opportunities across all sectors of the bioeconomy, we need to improve the efficiency of the strain engineering process to reduce development costs and time to market. \n\nOur ability to engineer biological systems has improved dramatically thanks to technological advances in genome engineering and interrogation tools over the last several decades. DNA sequencing, synthesis, and assembly technologies, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) genome editing, and other synthetic biology tools have greatly accelerated and elevated the strain engineering process. However, alongside the progress in manipulating genomes came the full appreciation that biology is incredibly complex and not as easy to engineer as man-made modular systems. A landmark publication titled \"Five hard truths for synthetic biology\" details the obstacles that stand in the way of fully utilizing synthetic biology to predictably engineer biological systems (Kwok, 2010 ).",

While it has been pointed out2 that the actual results represent an advance in DNA synthesis capabilities rather than what the sensational headlines have implied, the popular press has nonetheless evoked images of scientists that were previously only seen in science fiction. The lay public has a heightened awareness of synthetic biology and is both concerned and fascinated by the implications of this technology. The public\u2019s concerns should not be dismissed lightly. The field of synthetic biology is a consequence of numerous and inevitable advances in biological technologies. At the same time, interest and tools has arisen to apply a technology centric design-driven approach to complex biological systems3,4 to develop solutions for clinical and biotechnology challenges. \n \nIn the last four decades, the length of synthetic genes that can be produced in the laboratory has increased by four orders-of magnitude - from 102 to 106 base pairs5. At our limits, we can currently synthesize the DNA needed for simple bacteria1; extrapolating these trends into the future, however, provides a prediction that the synthesis of a complex genome (such as the human genome, 109 base pairs) will be feasible within the next 30 years. However, the rate has increased in the last decade, and the capability to synthesize such a complex genome may be achieved in as little as 10 years. Cost is a minor issue, but one that is quickly disappearing from the equation. The commercial cost to purchase / synthesize genes decreases significantly each year (decreasing at a rate of 30 % to 50 % per year6) \u2013 costs are expected to drop to $0.01 per base pair in the very near future7 \u2013 even without disruptive new methods, the current trend should reach this price point in 5 to 10 years. \n \nSynthetic biology holds tremendous promise as both an investigative and therapeutic modality. The implications of engineering biologic systems were one of the topics discussed at the 2009 National Academies Keck Futures Initiative on Synthetic Biology (NAKFI-SB) 11. Experts were asked to consider such basic questions as what tools and technologies are required to advance the field, why man-made biologic systems are more fragile than natural ones, and how to create and improve inter-cellular communication.

Engineering plays a crucial role in the rational design and construction of such systems, as principles like standardization, modularity and predictability of biological parts are considered key aspects [4]. The synthetic biology paradigm can be summarized as follows: i) choose biological parts from a library of well-characterized standard DNA components; ii) assemble them together to obtain a genetic program that encodes the desired function; iii) incorporate it in a living organism to ultimate the job, as it is carried out in many fields of engineering. Although the development of DNA standards (such as the Bio-Brick\u2122in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts) [5,6] and automated DNA assembly platforms [7,8] have significantly reduced the complexity of the genetic program composition process, each of the mentioned steps hides noteworthy difficulties [9,10]: inability to provide reproducible quantitative characterization of parts [11], crosstalk or incompatibility among components [1], time-consuming debugging of systems [12], variability connected with biological processes [13] and, finally, a high failure rate of the engineered organism due to DNA mutation [14]. Taken together, these points contribute to the inability to predict the behaviour of even simple synthetic biological systems. In fact, although relatively complex systems such as bistable switches [15], oscillators [16,17] logic functions [18][19][20][21][22], amplifiers [23] have been successfully built up in bacteria, yeasts or mammalian cells and a variety of computational tools have been developed to aid their design [24][25][26], the construction of predictable biological systems from the bottom-up is currently a main challenge [9,27]. Trial-and-error or directed evolution screenings are still commonly used to optimize and even repair suboptimal genetic circuits [18,[28][29][30].

            "text": "Synthetic biology applies engineering principles to the rational design of living organisms. Within this discipline, a biological system is viewed as a collection of characterized genetic parts that can be modified and reassembled to alter existing functions or to build them de novo in alternative host organisms. Genetic designs are revised through iterations of a design-build-test-learn cycle to achieve optimized metabolic configurations for biotechnological applications (Khalil and Collins, 2010;Nielsen and Keasling, 2016). Synthetic biology applied to microalgae will combine this powerful new approach with the benefits of a photosynthetic microbial host to generate novel production strains tailored to suit future environmental challenges (Figure 1a).\n\nTools for the genetic engineering of microalgae are evolving rapidly, enabled by the increased availability of sequenced genomes across multiple algal lineages. The sequencing of microalgal genomes has facilitated genetic tool development in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Mussgnug, 2015), stramenopiles Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Huang and Daboussi, 2017) and Nannochloropsis gaditana (Poliner et al., 2018), and cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Hagemann and Hess, 2018), among others. In addition, methods for the genetic transformation in microalgae have been optimized for many species and include natural transformation, electroporation, bead beating, biolistic transformation, and conjugative plasmid transfer (Qin et al., 2012).\n\nGenomic data from these species have facilitated the identification of native genetic elements necessary for genetic engineering and successful transformation. Several constitutive and inducible endogenous promoter/terminator pairs have been demonstrated to effectively express transgenes in model species Ramarajan et al., 2019), including bidirectional promoters for gene stacking or co-expression with a selectable marker (Poliner et al., 2018). In addition, heterologous or synthetic promoter sequences have been characterized (Berla et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2014;Scranton et al., 2016).

Among all recombinant expression hosts at work, E. coli is by far the most favored strain, owing to its outstanding genetic tractability, relative ease of cultivation, and innate capacity to accommodate and express exogenous proteins. Specifically, it is the model microbe with the most extensively characterized genome, transcriptome and translatome architectures, and underlying regulations [25,34]. In addition, the availability of a vast repertoire of synthetic biology tools such as libraries of promoters, ribosome-binding sites (RBS) and 5 -untranslated regions (5 -UTRs), expression vectors, and synthetic circuits effectively streamline its genetic manipulation [35][36][37][38][39]. In aspects of protein productivity, E. coli was reported to dedicate nearly 40% of its dry cell weight entirely for recombinant protein in fed-batch culture conditions [40], and are able to functionally express a wide spectrum of non-glycosylated proteins. Such inherent features of E. coli have much been exploited in the industry for mass-production of many commodity proteins [41]. \n\nEven so, securing high-purity, high-yield recombinant proteins, especially those of eukaryotic origin, has remained challenging in E. coli due to constraints inherent to cellular physiology and translational regulations. For instance, just as many prokaryotic expression systems, E. coli lacks post-translational modification machineries required for functional expression of proteins in eukaryotic origins, such as glycosylation [11]. This could present a serious drawback in prokaryote-based expression systems, considering that more than 50% of eukaryotic proteins are predicted to be glycosylated [42]. Other classes of post-translational modifications highly prevalent across eukaryotic proteins include phosphorylation and acetylation [43].",

            "text": "Devising gene cassettes or genetic circuits that perform specific functions has long been performed in synthetic biology field. Synthetic biology tools have been developed to generate mutations in the cell with different mutation rate, mutation range (specific regions or entire genome), multiplexity, and whether the altered phenotypes are permanent or removable. The power of these tools was usually examined through improving specific phenotypes such as production of colored chemicals or tolerance. However, industrially interesting chemicals are generally indistinguishable chemicals or provide no growth benefit to producers, and thus the step of acquiring improved variants from a huge library is considered as a major limitation. \n\nThus, the development of synthetic systems that convert specific chemical concentration or desired protein functions into selectable phenotype is another key for successful evolutionary engineering. For example, the use of biosensor that links the metabolite concentration to detectable phenotype such as fluorescence and resistance to selection pressure was exemplified for lysine, naringenin, glucaric acid, mevalonic acid, 3-HP, and so on. Therefore, discovering natural regulators and developing new regulators using synthetic parts will empower the biosensor-based screening/selection step. Moreover, well-designed accessory plasmids for PACE have expanded target functions to various properties. Multiple traits can also be satisfied by complex logic gates. \n\nAltogether, the advance in synthetic biology provides efficient tools for the two main steps of evolutionary engineering: genetic perturbation and acquisition of improved phenotype. Now, it is pushed to identify effective changes from randomly generated mutations. Analyzing the consequences of mutations on cellular/ protein functions is an additional step for evolutionary engineering. Recently, facilitated omics technology has assisted evolutionary engineering. Using next-generation sequencing, tracking genome-wide multiple mutations is plausible.

            "text": "Synthetic biology is now a mature field of research with an established record of newly developed biological molecular tools, devices, and cellular structural and functional modules. A core tenet of synthetic biology is that biological systems can exhibit the emergence of highly complex behaviours by virtue of the interconnection between simple 'modules' (e.g. DNA regulatory elements, and protein domains) that exhibit robust, well-defined functions regardless of the organismal context in which they are contained. Synthetic biology principles have found relevance and have been applied in the research design for a wide range of topics from fundamental to biotechnological, providing promising solutions to global challenges [5,6]. \n\nThe construction of the first synthetic circuits at the 'dawn' of synthetic biology was highly reliant on breaking genetic control systems down into definable parts and then collecting and using existing quantitative data that were most important for the function of these parts when used in different contexts [7,8]. While earlier engineering was, in part, restrained by technical limitations on what could be cloned, this restriction has largely evaporated in recent years. Improved DNA synthesis and assembly techniques have laid the groundwork for designing increasingly complex systems, such as biocellular and cell-free multipurpose metabolic factories, and the design of synthetic protocells and xenobiological systems [9][10][11]. Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial [13] and eukaryotic cells [14]. \n\nOne example of recombining large functional modules is the design of multispecies synthetic microbial communities: where individual microbial strains may be of natural origin or genetically engineered to conduct desired functions [15]. Still, many current applications in the literature were achieved by following a more handcrafted and intuitive type of approach, rather than following the whole engineering cycle and utilizing a quantitative approach.",

            "text": "A central aim of synthetic biology is to increase the ease and efficiency with which biological systems can be designed, constructed, and characterized. Although the manipulation of biological organisms and molecular pathways long preceded the emergence of synthetic biology, the engineering of biological systems has been a largely ad hoc exercise. A main reason is that biology is inherently diverse, mutable, and context specific. Natural biological substrates, including genetic elements such as promoters and genes, do not always behave predictably when implemented in different combinations, and details such as how individual parts are physically connected can vary widely across different construction methods. As a result, the components designed and assembled for one biological system often cannot be predictably reused in another system. Synthetic biology seeks to address this challenge by implementing a more 'engineeringready' conceptual framework that emphasizes the need to generate and report biological constructs in a manner that is conducive to their understanding and utilization by a broad community of researchers.\n\nThe application of engineering tools such as abstrac tion, decoupling, and standardization was proposed early in the emergence of synthetic biology to support the efficiency and scaling of the biological system design process [1]. An abstraction hierarchy that dissects the engineering process into several design levels DNA, parts, devices, and systems provides synthetic biologists with a means to manage complexity and distribute tasks. The design process at each abstraction level can be performed relatively independently of the other levels, and detailed information critical to one abstraction level need only be considered by designers operating at that level. This division of labor reduces the amount of infor ma tion that each designer must be expert in to success fully design a part, device, or system.\n\nDecoupling refers to the strategy of partitioning a complicated problem into simpler tasks that can be tackled separately and assembled into a complete solution. The separation of design and fabrication pro cesses is an important example of decoupling supported by advances in design tools and fabrication platforms. The increasing efficiency and decreasing cost of DNA synthesis allow synthetic biologists to design novel systems with the confidence that DNA components can be readily synthesized by commercial sources. Further more, advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis pro vide researchers with access to biological components encoding functions of interest using sequence informa tion deposited in databases, eliminating the need for physical exchange of genetic materials.\n\nStandardization takes several forms, including standardi zation of physical",

Synthetic biology, which aims to design and create new living organisms, has developed rapidly under this background and has shown great promise for applications in biomedicine, agriculture, vaccines, manufacturing, and energy. In continuous exploration and research, gene editing technologies, especially CRISPR, have evolved from initial reliance on naturally occurring homologous recombination in cells to targeted cleavage at almost any site, and even to nucleic acid-based diagnostics. The simplicity and efficiency of its operation has greatly facilitated the genetic modification of species and disease diagnosis. Gene editing provides the means for continued modification of synthetic life and opens up more possibilities for the creation of new species through genetic modification. De novo genome synthesis and the large-scale modifications of natural genomes belong to the fields of synthetic genomics and gene editing (Xie et al., 2017), both subjects are current hot spots topics in synthetic biology research.\n\nSince Science magazine named CRISPR technology the breakthrough of the year in 2015, this new technology has taken the gene-editing field by storm. In the past few years, CRISPR technology has rapidly swept the animal world as a popular gene editing technique. Although the research and application of gene editing technology has been developing rapidly, gene editing technology still faces challenges in terms of off-target, ethics and safety. The future development of gene editing technology needs to pay attention to the following aspects: first, strengthen planning and guidance, and attach great importance to strengthening research on basic theories and innovative methods of gene editing; second, strengthen supervision and scientific guidance, and pay attention to the applications of gene editing; third, strengthen research on ethical norms, improve the legal and policy system for gene editing supervision, and vigorously support the research and development of animal gene editing products; fourth, strengthen the popularization of science, let more people understand and accept gene editing technology, so that gene editing can better benefit mankind.",

            "text": "The development of bioinformatics and functional genomics has enabled not only the ability to understand or modify existing biological systems but also to create new biological systems for special purposes. The natural outcome of such an advance is synthetic biology, which deals with the design and assembly of predictable and robust biological parts/systems and systems biology, which aims at system-level understanding of biological systems. These well-characterized and novel biological parts/systems would in turn provide useful drugs, green fuels, or other high value biomaterials [1,2]. Synthetic biologists differ from genetic engineers in that they try to engineer and create complex biological systems for practical applications from lesser understood and unreliable basic components [3]. Systems biologists develop tools of modeling, simulation, and comparison to experiment in order to understand complex biological systems. The systems biology approach will be especially useful in synthetic biology. Challenges associated with the progress in synthetic biology and systems biology will be the focus of this review. \n\nThe two main challenges that limit the progress of synthetic biology are the complexity of the biological systems and the physical variations in biological behavior. These limitations lead to an uncertain probability of success of the engineered biological systems and an inability to fully predict even a simple component [3,4]. Despite several advances in synthetic biology, engineering biological systems is still an expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable process [4]. The response of a biological system is usually nonlinear in that even a simple pathway in a well-studied microorganism cannot be explained satisfactorily. The task of creating an artificial biological system is made more complex with the increase in the complexity of the novel genetic circuits. \n\nUnlike other electrical systems in which interactions between individual components are well characterized and the components operate independently, with the biological components, one cannot avoid undesirable crosstalk due to nonspecific interactions with other components in the cell. Understanding the overall behavior of the natural system is a prerequisite for the successful design of a synthetic biological system. High-throughput experimental methods are necessary to understand the complexity associated with biological systems [5]. Automated, multiplex, and parallel reactions are mandatory in order to gain a deeper insight into the complex biological systems.",

            "text": "With advantageous features including non-pathogenicity, lack of carbon catabolite repression system, and low protease activity, C. glutamicum has been investigated as an ideal chassis for microbial production [130]. Since the discovery of the strain, it has been used for industrial amino acid production, such as \u029f-glutamate and \u029f-lysine. Moreover, tolerance to organic acids and aromatic compounds allows producing various industrial chemicals or value-added products such as flavonoids and terpenoids [131][132][133]. \n\nFrom the traditional allelic exchange-based recombination method to the base editor, genome manipulation techniques have achieved significant advances in C. glutamicum. More efficient, accurate, and time-saving strategies were introduced, allowing the construction of various strains easier. Nevertheless, some remaining challenges still hinder rapid strain development, such as the plasmid curing process and the lack of multiplex genome editing tools. In this regard, steady development of novel genome editing technologies in C. glutamicum is required for more effective engineering. \n\nSynthetic biology tools for controlling gene expression through static, dynamic, and multiplex regulation have been investigated in C. glutamicum. Those tools allowed fine-tuned gene expression and aided the construction of more functional, productive chassis strains. Although various synthetic tools have been developed, lacking information on native genetic components and cellular mechanisms restricts more applications for practical uses. Therefore, more detailed gene expression mechanisms of C. glutamicum should also be further investigated in parallel with the development of synthetic biology tools. \n\nLikewise, continuous progress in gene editing and regulation tools has been made in C. glutamicum; however, there is still a long way to go compared to the model organisms like E. coli or S. cerevisiae. The number of available synthetic biology tools determines how diverse and efficient manipulations can be achieved in that organism. Developing numerous high-functional tools for C. glutamicum may promote the engineering of de novo strains. With the promising features for the biosynthesis of various products, additional synthetic biology tools should be developed for more practical applications in biotechnology industries.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a revolutionary development in life sciences. It is highly multidisciplinary where molecular biology, physical sciences and engineering merge to design and construct new biological parts, novel artificial biological pathways, organisms or devices and systems including the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. We may call it bioengineering. It has already produced tumour-seeking microbes for cancer treatment, photosynthetic systems to produce energy, artificial life, etc. Like engineering, it too aims to produce standardized components and connectors, manufacturing and assembly processes, test vehicles and certification processes, etc. to enable production and marketing of increasingly sophisticated and functional systems on a mass scale. In a sense, \"Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems which display functions that do not exist in nature. This engineering perspective may be applied at all levels of the hierarchy of biological structures -from individual molecules to whole cells, tissues and organisms. In essence, synthetic biology will enable the design of 'biological systems' in a rational and systematic way.\" [17]. \n\nEnormous expectations rest on future advancements in systems biology as it has the potential to radically change the way we approach key technologies, such as medicine and manufacturing. Current efforts have focused on creating highly generic capabilities (the building blocks) in the form of bio-tools and bio-processes that can be scaled for industrial application. Given the high intellectual calibre of the synthetic biology research community, it appears inevitable that the scientific knowledge they produce and place in the public domain will quickly be translated into industrial applications of high economic value by equally talented industry researchers. This raises obvious concerns about the ownership and control of generated intellectual property that may lead to high commercial value in a twenty-first century economy that truly belongs to the life sciences. The key enabling technology is DNA synthesis. The workspace includes microbes, mammalian cells, plants, etc. Its applications include therapeutics, energy (e.g., fuels), chemicals, agriculture, etc. \n\nThe pioneering paper of Watson and Crick [12] that elucidated the double helix structure of cellular DNA has been hailed as the greatest discovery in biology since Darwin's theory of evolution.",

Plant synthetic biology is still in its early stages and requires more quantitative and predictable study. Despite the challenges, some pioneering examples have been successfully demonstrated in model plants.As an increasing number of synthetic switches and circuits have been created for plant systems and of synthetic products produced in plant chassis, plant synthetic biology is taking a strong foothold in agriculture and medicine. The ever\u2010exploding data has also promoted the expansion of toolkits in this field. Genetic parts libraries and quantitative characterization approaches have been developed. However, plant synthetic biology is still in its infancy. The considerations for selecting biological parts to design and construct genetic circuits with predictable functions remain desired.In this article, we review the current biotechnological progresses in field of plant synthetic biology. Assembly standardization and quantitative approaches of genetic parts and genetic circuits are discussed. We also highlight the main challenges in the iterative cycles of design\u2010build\u2010test\u2010learn for introducing novel traits into plants.Plant synthetic biology promises to provide important solutions to many issues in agricultural production, human health care, and environmental sustainability. However, tremendous challenges exist in this field. For example, the quantitative characterization of genetic parts is limited; the orthogonality and the transfer functions of circuits are unpredictable; and also, the mathematical modeling\u2010assisted circuits design still needs to improve predictability and reliability.

            "text": "3][24] Expressing certain types of proteins, such as proteases and integral membrane proteins, is also known to be stressful or toxic to E. coli cells, due either directly to their functions or to competition with native proteins for secretion machinery. 25,26 Proteins used for orthogonal control of gene expression, like T7 RNA polymerase and dCas9, can exhibit excessive activity or off-target effects that are extremely burdensome. 27 Finally, unintentional expression of antisense and frameshifted gene products from cryptic promoters and ribosome binding sites has been shown to be an unexpected source of burden in some constructs. 9,20 ring of standardized genetic parts has been a cornerstone of synthetic biology since its inception. 28,29 The Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a database of engineered DNA sequences 30 that thousands of teams have contributed to as part of their participation in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition. 31,32 Most BioBrick parts are cloned into a small set of standard vector backbones, which makes these plasmids a useful \"common garden\" for analyzing the properties of inserts encoding different genetic parts and devices. In past studies, BioBricks have been used to compare standardized measurements of promoter strength 33 and fluorescent protein expression 34,35 across many labs. It has been proposed that genetic reliability-in the evolutionary sense of for how many cell doublings a certain level of function is maintained in a population-be listed on a data sheet describing a genetic part, 29 but this property is rarely characterized in practice. One goal of iGEM is to improve upon existing parts, and many BioBrick sequences are re-used by synthetic biology researchers outside of iGEM. Therefore, characterizing which of these parts are evolutionarily unstable and understanding why this is the case would broadly benefit the field. \n\nWe measured the burden of 301 BioBrick plasmids from the iGEM Registry containing DNA constructs ranging from individual parts to complex devices. None of these plasmids reduced the growth rate of their E. coli hosts by >45%, in agreement with stochastic simulations of evolution that predict a level of burden above this threshold would make a construct \"unclonable\".",

            "text": "aforementioned sequences for any given transgene is hard to predict, as is the stability of the resulting recombinant protein. For example, while the 59-and 39transcript untranslated regions (UTRs) substantively bear upon RNA stability [10], the 59-segments of coding sequences (CDSs) significantly influence translation efficiency [11,12]. Hence, rational and targeted manipulation of the aforesaid genetic elements can substantially boost expression levels. Moreover, it has been shown that N-terminal fusions of short peptides as well as signal sequences directly affect the stability of recombinant proteins [13]. In light of all the enumerated findings pertaining to the influence of diverse sequence elements on gene expression and protein stability, construction of large sets of transformation vectors becomes a prerequisite for effective modification of the plastid genome. Taken together with the inherent requirement to replace and shuffle flanking sequences necessary for homologous recombination and integration of the transgene cassettes into the genome of a given plant at a specific position, the cited considerations point to extensive and oftentimes cumbersome cloning procedures as the critical hurdle to dynamic development and far-reaching application of plastid genome engineering. Consequently, while an extensive array of expression vectors have been developed and made available to the research community in recent years [14][15][16], the engineering of novel genetic elements and target plant species still requires tedious redesign and recloning in almost all cases. On the one hand, with DNA synthesis becoming less and less expensive, the challenge can now be addressed through total synthesis of optimized vectors, eliminating repetitive sequences or unfavorable restriction sites by design. On the other, the synthetic approach provides merely case-by-case solutions to the individual experimental objectives and is at odds with the central premise of rational bio-engineering.\n\nStandardization of reusable biological components as a means to efficiently design and engineer biological systems is a paradigm of synthetic biology, as recently reiterated by one of its co-founders [17]. While in many ways the young discipline has been staggeringly successful, with the creation of the minimal cell marking a stepping stone in its ground-breaking advent [18], the very concept of standardization -the driving force of Industrial Revolution and primer of the Information Age",

Nowadays, this research area combines approaches from biology, physics, mathematics and chemistry with the aim of modifying existing biological systems, or creating entirely new ones, to generate tools and knowledge for research or practical applications. To achieve such goals, synthetic biologists apply engineering principles (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006) in an iterative process that generates predictable and reliable models to be tested experimentally and thus gather information for future improved design (Cameron et al., 2014).\n\nIn the last decade, this framework has also been adopted in plant biology (Liu & Stewart, 2015). Continuous progress in the collection and functional characterization of DNA modules already enables the construction of synthetic genetic circuits in plant cells (Andres et al., 2019). Some bright examples, in which the aforementioned approaches have been used to ameliorate plant photosynthetic (South et al., 2019) and water-use efficiency (Park et al., 2015;Papanatsiou et al., 2019), demonstrate that synthetic biology can provide unprecedented opportunities to assist and speed up the generation of crops with improved responses to the environment.

            "text": "Synthetic biology is concerned with applying the engineering paradigm of systems design to biological systems in order to produce predictable and robust systems with novel functionalities that do not exist in nature. The circuit-like connectivity of biological parts and their ability to collectively process logical operations was first appreciated nearly 50 years ago. This inspired attempts to describe biological regulation schemes with mathematical models and to apply circuit analogies from established frameworks in electrical engineering(McAdams & Arkin A,2000). Meanwhile, breakthroughs in genomic research and genetic engineering (e.g., recombinant DNA technology) were supplying the inventory and methods necessary to physically construct and assemble biomolecular parts. As a result, synthetic biology was born with the broad goal of engineering or \u201cwiring\u201d biological circuitry\u2014be it genetic, protein, viral, pathway, or genomic\u2014for manifesting logical forms of cellular control. Synthetic biology, equipped with the engineering-driven approaches of modularization, rationalization, and modeling, has progressed rapidly and generated an ever-increasing suite of genetic devices and biological modules. synthetic biology is seeking to use and expand the mechanisms that control biological organisms using engineering approaches. These approaches will be applied on all scales of biological complexity: from the basic units to novel interactions between these units to novel multi-component modules that generate complex logical behaviour, and even to completely or partially engineered cells(McAdams & Shapiro,1995). Bringing the engineering paradigm to biology will allow us to apply existing biological knowledge to biotechnological problems in a much more rational and systematic way than has previously been possible, and at the same time to expand the scope of what can be achieved this way. The introduction of design principles such as modularity of parts, standardization of parts and devices according to internationally recognized criteria, and the adaptation of available abstract design procedures to biological systems, coupled to novel technological breakthroughs that allow the decoupling of design and fabrication, will fundamentally change our current concepts of how to manipulate biological systems. In this sense, synthetic biology is not primarily a \u201cdiscovery science\u201d, but is ultimately about a new way of making things. By adapting natural biological mechanisms to the requirements of an engineering approach, the possibilities for re-assembling biological systems in a designed way will increase tremendously.

Since the discovery of DNA structure by Watson and Crick in 1953, synthetic biology has undergone rapid development. During this time, synthetic biologists have developed numerous tools and technologies to better understand biological systems and to develop new methods for constructing and manipulating these systems. Initially, synthetic biology research was mainly focused on genetic engineering, with the primary goal of inserting artificially synthesized DNA into biological systems to achieve specific functions. However, over time, this field has become increasingly complex, and researchers have begun exploring broader issues, such as how to integrate biological and non-biological systems and how to use these systems for medical and environmental applications. In recent years, synthetic biology research has reached new heights, involving the construction of artificially synthesized genomes and cells, and how to apply these systems to medical, energy, and environmental fields. These research achievements offer enormous potential for treating diseases, reducing pollution, and producing clean energy. In addition, the development of synthetic biology also involves artificial intelligence and machine learning, which can help accelerate the design and construction of biological systems, thus speeding up the progress of synthetic biology. Although synthetic biology still faces many challenges, the development prospects of this field are still very promising with the continuous advancement of technology. This article aims to provide an overview of the development of synthetic biology, including its historical background, early development, technological advances, applications, ethical and social impacts, and future directions, and explore the development process of synthetic biology over the past 60 years.",

Although they cannot all be discussed in detail in this paper, for ease of reference, four different sub-strands of synthetic biology are distinguished here 3 :\n\n\u2022 Engineering DNA based biological circuits, by using standardized biological parts; \u2022 Identifying the minimal genome;\n\n\u2022 Constructing protocells, in other words living cells from base chemicals; and \u2022 Creating orthogonal biological systems in the laboratory through chemical synthetic biology.\n\nThese four strands are supplemented by two enabling technologies that often are also subsumed under the heading of synthetic biology, although they have a more supportive role to the main strands of the field. This applies first and foremost to the increasingly more affordable large-scale DNA synthesis capabilities that a small number of companies are providing, 4 but also to the more generic bioinformatics capabilities utilized by those attempting to identify a minimal genome, to model protocells or to apply engineering principles to biology in a more generic sense.\n\nSynthetic biology therefore has to be understood as a key piece in the puzzle of converging science and technology that aims at fusing molecular biology with engineering, by designing and producing new biological parts, devices and systems. To achieve this goal, synthetic biology utilizes high throughput commercial DNA synthesis capabilities to provide the actual biological material for the assembly of genetic circuits. In addition, synthetic biology is relying on increasingly powerful information technology tools that allow for the modelling of certain desired biological functions. A report by the Royal Academy of Engineering (Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE) 2009a) in the UK has described in detail the design cycle that informs the engineering approach to synthetic biology. Standardized bio-parts that have undergone appropriate quality controls can then in turn be utilized to build standard devices, which, in turn, can be assembled into more complex biological systems.\n\nSeveral drivers account for the rapid exponential development of the field of synthetic biology over the past few years. These range from dedicated funding initiatives mostly in the US and Europe with the US outspending Europe almost 3 to 1 (Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars 2010) to the annual International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competitions 5 as well as the five SBx.0 conferences.

            "text": "There are several challenges that we still face when applying synthetic biology methodologies to new systems. As is true with any engineering process or assay, standardization and component modularity remain areas of improvement. Central to this is the ability to measure things accurately and reliably. Recognizing the importance of measurement accuracy and reproducibility to synthetic biology, a new joint initiative between NIST, Stanford, and industry (JIMB -https://jimb.stanford.edu/) has recently been established with the goal of improving metrology within the biological sciences and initially focusing in synthetic biology and genomics [66]. \n\nFor top-down approaches, off-target effects as well as specificity of reagents or genetic circuits are particularly important to consider. The leakiness of expression and switch-like behavior of sensors can have consequential implications on the accuracy of measurements. Researchers developing these technologies have spent significant time investigating these areas to limit the effects of these challenges by including additional \"insulators\" to genetic circuits (commonly accounted for in sensor design software tools) as well as modeling the compatibility of multi-layer circuit designs [55,58]. Recognizing these limitations, researchers have utilized irreversible methods events such as cleavage or DNA mutagenesis as readouts to decrease measurement stochasticity. \n\nAreas of improvement in bottom-up synthetic biology can be further sub-divided. To improve liposome stability, the use of buffers with potential compatibility issues with other components remains an area of improvement. One report found that the use of polyvinyl alcohol precipitated some of the cell-free expression components in liposomes [67]. Oftentimes this limitation can be overcome by making predictable changes to buffer composition. Robustness of liposome generation protocols is also an area from improvement as the strengths and weaknesses of each approach need to be considered for each application. For cell-free expression systems, while the list of different cellfree lysates generated from different cell types continues to grow, it is still limited and can become an issue if cell type specific processes are studied. Additionally, the efficacy of the cell-free systems to synthesize all proteins (very large or difficult to fold) remains largely unknown and may require special modifications to ensure proper folding or modification for protein activity.",

            "text": "Synthetic genetic circuits, such as a toggle switch (Gardner et al., 2000), an oscillator (Stricker et al., 2008), feedback loops (Dahl et al., 2013), and a Boolean logic gate (Green et al., 2017), can control cell performance and behavior. Moreover, microorganisms are reprogrammed to diagnose and treat diseases (Riglar & Silver, 2018) and can be utilized as biosensors capable of detecting metabolites, enzyme products, and harmful substances (Kim et al., 2016a). In addition, reprogrammed microorganisms are used to produce desired substances from synthetic cells in the fields of bioenergy, chemistry, and medicine (Nielsen & Keasling, 2016). For example, the biosynthetic pathway from Artemisia annua L. (sweet wormwood) can be transplanted to Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce artemisinic acid, an antimalarial drug precursor in microbial cell factories (Ro et al., 2006). \n\nSynthetic biology tools have been developed to design and optimize living systems (Leon-Buitimea et al., 2022). Among them, CRISPR-Cas, an adaptive immune system of microorganisms, has been developed as a genome editing technology (Jinek et al., 2012). CRISPR gene scissors are divided into two modules: nucleolytic protein and target recognition RNA; therefore, they can be used and applied more synthetic-biologically than any other tool (Clarke et al., 2021). Unlike restriction enzymes, any target sequence can be easily and freely designed, and CRISPR-Cas can operate from bacteria to higher organisms. \n\nIn microbiology, CRISPR technology has advanced in the following directions. CRISPR genome editing tools have been developed in various microorganisms (Lee & Lee, 2021). The function of recognizing specific sequences in CRISPR-Cas has been expanded and applied to molecular diagnosis (Kim et al., 2021). In addition, with nucleolytic activity-free Cas proteins, gene expression and biosynthetic circuits in synthetic cells can be precisely regulated (Santos-Moreno & Schaerli, 2020).",

            "text": "Making CFPS more efficient can lead to higher protein production yields, lower costs, and the ability to create complex proteins that are difficult to generate through conventional means. A critical factor in enhancing CFPS efficiency is the fine-tuning of reaction environments to boost protein synthesis while using resources judiciously. This involves adjusting variables such as the reaction's pH, temperature, ion levels, energy sources, and the activity of various enzymes to foster a more productive setting for protein creation [9]. Equally vital is the careful design of the DNA templates used for expressing proteins. Techniques like codon optimization, predicting the secondary structure of mRNA, and tweaking regulatory elements are strategies used to increase the efficiency of translation and minimize the chances of mRNA breakdown or incomplete protein synthesis [10]. \n\nInnovations in the components of cell-free systems, like new types of lysates, customized ribosomes, and synthetic genetic frameworks, also contribute significantly to improving CFPS efficiency [11]. Such advancements allow for the generation of proteins with desired features, including a better stability, solubility, or specific modifications after translation. Furthermore, the application of computational tools is indispensable in enhancing CFPS. Table 1 outlines several key software tools utilized in plasmid editing and design, highlighting their relevance for cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems. These tools range from molecular biology software packages for DNA sequence analysis, visualization, and annotation to comprehensive suites for plasmid management and cloud-based platforms for collaborative design. Each tool is described in terms of its functionalities, such as plasmid construction, sequence alignment, primer design, molecular cloning, and sequence editing. The applications of these software tools in CFPS are emphasized, demonstrating their utility in designing and analyzing plasmids that contain DNA templates for CFPS reactions. This includes features like promoter regions, coding sequences, regulatory elements, and other relevant features that facilitate accurate cloning, the PCR amplification of DNA templates, and the optimization of plasmids for CFPS. This compilation serves as a resource for researchers involved in CFPS experiments, aiding in the efficient design and analysis of plasmids to accelerate advancements in synthetic biology, molecular biology, and biotechnology research.",

Considering the limitations of applications such as their narrow host range, immune toxicity, and low infection efficiency, it is time-consuming and laborious to select suitable phages from the natural phage library. Under \"design-build-test-learn\" theory, synthetic biologists manipulate phage genomes bottom-up by means of evolving molecular biology methods, such as recombination tools, large fragment cloning technology, CRISPR and base editing, cheap synthetic genes, and cell-free systems, to obtain engineered phages with specific functions to support pathogen defense, drug delivery, bacterial detection, and material science. \n\nEngineering of phage is encouraging. The huge diversity of phage types and gene pools in nature is our valuable gift. So far, phage synthetic biology has only utilized a small part of the existing phage types, and the potential of the vast arsenal is far from being tapped. For commercial production and application of the engineered phages in \"outside-Thelab\" spaces in the future, challenges still remain, such as long-term stability, storage and production conditions, and production cost. 130 With the innovation of technology and the combination of multi-disciplines, it is believed that it will",

            "text": "At its core, one of the aims of synthetic biology is to make biology easier to engineer by leveraging technologies, such as gene synthesis, and adopting core engineering principles, such as modularity, standardisation and abstraction [1]. This approach has re-imagined the way we tinker with biology and defined the field as a new way to systematically design and construct new biological parts, devices and systems, or the reengineering existing biological systems for practical applications [2,3]. Although further advancements are required to move beyond the current iterative \"design-build-test-learn\" (DBTL) cycle-a framework designed for the systematic optimisation of biological systems-towards a more streamlined \"design-build-work\" framework [4], the synthetic biology community has made remarkable progress over the years [5,6]. These advancements have surpassed some of the limitations of traditional genetic engineering and have fundamentally altered our approach to developing sustainable biotechnologies. To date, building on these advances, synthetic biology has catalysed transformative innovations across a range of commercial applications, benefiting society in sectors, such as food, agriculture, biofuels, healthcare, and biomanufacturing (Figure 1) [6]. \n\nAs a result, it has been argued that using synthetic biology to drive biotechnological innovations could represent a vital step towards transitioning from the current economic model to a more sustainable, bio-based economy that is in harmony with our environment [7,8]. Recognising the transformative potential of synthetic biology and biotechnology, over 65 countries, including leading economies such as the United States [9], the United Kingdom [10] and Germany [11], have developed targeted strategies to integrate these technologies into their economic frameworks. Consequently, these nations have established dedicated bioeconomy strategies that harness the This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes. benefits of current biotechnological advancements and their national capabilities [12,13].",

            "text": "The bottom-up engineering of living systems exhibiting predictable functions is one of the main goals of synthetic biology [1][2][3]. This approach relies on the modularity of the used components [4][5][6][7] or the predictability of system function upon parts interconnection, environmental change or genetic context variation [8,9]. A reliable biological system design process will open the door to the full exploitation of synthetic biology's potential, which will benefit many application fields, like medicine and bioenergy, via the construction of customized systems for new drugs or fuel biosynthesis [10,11]. However, the interconnection of quantitatively characterized biological parts may lead to composite systems with apparently unpredictable behaviour, that is, the output cannot be intuitively gathered from the available knowledge of subparts [5,6,12]. Basic research studies on ad-hoc constructed model systems have been conducted to elucidate the entity of context-dependent variability of biological parts and devices and, ultimately, to identify the factors contributing to this variability [6,[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. In such studies, components like promoters or simple inducible/repressible devices were individually characterized and used to engineer genetic networks of increasing complexity, including transcriptional regulator cascades, feedbackcontrolled systems or networks mimicking logic functions. The comparison between the experimental output of interconnected circuits and mathematical model predictions has been useful to evaluate the predictability boundaries of biological components when re-used to engineer diverse systems [20]. Moreover, some of the factors affecting system modularity have been found, such as DNA sequences that might enhance or decrease transcriptional activity when placed upstream or downstream of promoters [6,15] or retroactivity effects due to the presence of DNA binding sites in interconnected modules [8,21]. \n\nContext-dependent variability studies have also led to the development of specific genetic architectures, which significantly enhance the predictability of re-used components, such as insulation sequences for promoters [15] and bicistronic design (BCD) for ribosome binding sites (RBSs) [22].",

            "text": "Synthetic biology aims to perform various specific functions in organisms by inserting a designed gene network. In the past, synthetic biology could be classified as having two broad purposes. The first was to create artificial life from natural biology using the synthetic methods. The other was to assemble some functional components using interchangeable natural components which are nonexistent in natural biology [1]. A lot of the recent literature focuses on performing electronic circuit behaviors in organisms using genetic devices such as toggle switches [2][3][4][5], oscillators [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13], pulse generators [14,15], logic gates [16][17][18][19], and filters [20][21][22]. Synthetic biologists also design various types of genetic circuits with different functionalities by employing genetic devices to solve useful tasks, such as biosensor decisions or edge detection [23,24].\n\nIn many industries, such as the electronics and manufacturing industries, the characterization and standardization of components and the institution of specifications are already key elements in the production line. In the synthetic biology, the expression of a specific protein needs a promoter, a ribosome binding side (RBS), a protein coding sequence and a terminator, which are DNA fragments. The Registry of Biological Standard Parts (http://www.partsregistry.org), formed by MIT, shows many standard BioBricks, and these standard biological components provide synthetic biologists with a quick and standardized way of constructing gene circuits. Also, BioFAB provides some sorts of biobricks (see http://biofab.org/data), enabling the rapid design and prototyping of genetic constructs. However, in the past, the strength of a promoter and an RBS, which are the main components of transcription and translation, were defined according to their relative strength with other promoters and RBSs. Now, however, the promoter-RBS strength can be quantified by measuring the fluorescence of proteins whose coding gene is constructed at the downstream of the promoter-RBS component.\n\nBased on the kinetic strengths of promoter-RBS components, promoter-RBS libraries are constructed for gene circuit design.

            "text": "Therefore, those findings represented a major advance not just in the study of gene regulation, but also in the study of how the components or functional modules of a vector system affect each other (Fig. 3). \n\nA few years after Lutz and Bujard's work, despite the rather tumultuous generation of cloning vectors, a new conceptual framework was conceived, combining the technological advances in molecular biology and the hierarchical abstraction and rational design concepts from Engineering Sciences. It was called synthetic biology (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006) and its main rationale was to shift molecular biology from traditional 'copy and paste' methods to a more high-throughput, concise and design-oriented background for generating novel biological functions. As highlighted by Lutz and Bujard's studies (Lutz and Bujard, 1997) and by many others afterwards, each part of the vector system matters, and in order to standardize biological parts, the generation of vectors with easily interchangeable modules would be essential. Thus, it did not take long for the first library of standardized vectors and biological parts to be established. In 2003, the BioBrick standard (BBF RFC 10) was proposed by Knight (2003), employing standard suffix and prefix sequences that flanked every designed biological part (see Fig. 3). This method was further optimized (Canton et al., 2008;Shetty et al., 2008) and has allowed an easy process for joining parts by standard restriction-ligation methods and hierarchical assembly (Shetty et al., 2011). Further efforts driven by the dissemination of the community-based iGEM competition have allowed the development of a repository of standard biological parts and novel standards for vector assembly (Endy, 2005;Knight, 2007;M\u20ac uller et al., 2009;R\u00f8kke et al., 2014). Towards next-generation genetic tools 129 \n\nAlthough the BioBricks standard was essential for establishing functional units in synthetic biology such as promoters, terminators and genes, it did not provide many flexible modules (e.g. no easily and independent interchangeable modules for origins of replication and antibiotic resistance genes).",

            "text": "Research and technological advances will improve CRISPR-Cas technology's efficiency, specificity, and flexibility. Cas protein variants improve gene expression and regulation. Extremophile genome alteration will enhance biofuel production. CRISPR-Cas may help in regulation of metabolic pathways of extremophiles. Precision gene expression modulation optimises metabolic flow for biofuel production. Novel extremophilic micro-organisms may be identified with property of higher biofuel synthesis. CRISPR-Cas gene editing may improve biofuel host specificity. Gene manipulation may enhance these organisms' usage of lignocellulosic biomass or syngas. This increases biofuel feedstocks, efficiency, and sustainability. Lignocellulosic substance inhibits biofuel fermentation. CRISPR-Cas may help bacteria survive these inhibitors and convert biomass into biofuels. By altering inhibitor detoxification and resistance genes, researchers can boost biofuel production. Biofuel production is promising using CRISPR-Cas gene editing and synthetic biology. CRISPR-based genome editing and synthetic biology methods like constructing synthetic genetic circuits and pathways may enhance biofuel production and cell activity. Biofuel production innovation and sustainable bioenergy systems will result from this interdisciplinary approach. CRISPR-Cas gene editing might change extremophile biofuel production. This advanced technology optimises metabolic pathways, host specificity, and inhibitor tolerance. CRISPR-Cas and synthetic biology will accelerate sustainable biofuel production.",

            "text": "Thus, the in-silico design results were seamlessly bridged with in-vitro vector construction and in-vivo C. glutamicum point mutation editing. \n\nAlthough the emerging CRISPR/Cas genome editing systems are increasingly favored for genetic manipulation in C. glutamicum (Wang et al., 2021), the counter-selection-based system is still a reliable genome editing technique, especially for the construction of mutations that require strictly precise nucleotide editing (Stella et al., 2019). To improve the editing efficiency of this technique, various variants were developed, for example by replacing the native promoter of sacB in classical pK18mobsacB with the 18-times stronger P lacM promoter (Tan et al., 2012), replacing the negative selection marker sacB with the novel streptomycin-sensitive gene rpsL (Kim et al., 2011) or 5-fluorouracil-lethal gene upp (Ma et al., 2015), as well as replacing single-copy and non-replicating pK18-derived vectors with multi-copy and temperature-sensitive pCGR2-derived vectors (Okibe et al., 2011). Notably, GEDpm-cg is able to flexibly support all these counterselection-based variants upon the uploading of specific linear vector sequences by the user. What's more, GEDpm-cg can also be used for genomic point mutation editing in other species beyond C. glutamicum based on this same approach if the users upload corresponding genome and vector sequences. Nevertheless, the upgrading of GEDpm-cg to support point mutation editing by other genome editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas system and/or other editing types for fragment sequence editing is still expected to fulfil different users' preferences in our future work. \n\nWith the recent technology advances in robotic/software-assisted strain engineering system, it has become feasible to enable an ultraefficient turnover rate of design-build-test-learn synthetic biology cycle (Chao et al., 2017;Hillson et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that takes an engineering approach to biosciences research and to the development of new biotechnologies (1,2). The rise of synthetic biology has been triggered by the increasing use of quantitative and mathematical techniques in biological research and the explosion of biological data (e.g. genome sequences) provided by the 'omics' era (3,4), combined with impressive decreases in the cost of custom synthesized genes and DNA (5,6). The capacity of synthetic biology is now largely limited by our ability to design, assemble and screen new DNA-encoded constructs for their intended biological function (7)(8)(9)(10). \n\nOne of the key engineering principles that synthetic biology researchers aim to apply to biology is standardization (11,12). Community efforts have made impressive steps toward standardization of measurement (13,14) and standardization of data and models (15,16); however, standardization of DNA assembly has fared less well. Early on in the emergence of synthetic biology, a standard for DNA assembly that defined DNA sequences as biological parts known as BioBricks (17), gained significant traction despite recognized shortcomings that include requiring all DNA parts to be absent of four common restriction enzyme recognition sites, and only permitting pairwise (two-at-a-time) assembly (9). Iterations of this standard have since appeared that address some of the limitations of BioBrick assembly and the BioBrick part format (18,19), but these have not been widely adopted. Instead, the DNA assembly methodologies that have seen the widest adoption within the synthetic biology community are those that do not require standardization of the parts involved. In particular, Gibson assembly, previously known as isothermal DNA assembly (20), has rapidly risen to being the most-used DNA assembly method in the field (21), despite being essentially a bespoke method, rather than a modular standard.",

            "text": "BackgroundEfficient and convenient genome-editing toolkits can expedite genomic research and strain improvement for desirable phenotypes. Zymomonas mobilis is a highly efficient ethanol-producing bacterium with a small genome size and desirable industrial characteristics, which makes it a promising chassis for biorefinery and synthetic biology studies. While classical techniques for genetic manipulation are available for Z. mobilis, efficient genetic engineering toolkits enabling rapidly systematic and high-throughput genome editing in Z. mobilis are still lacking.ResultsUsing Cas12a (Cpf1) from Francisella novicida, a recombinant strain with inducible cas12a expression for genome editing was constructed in Z. mobilis ZM4, which can be used to mediate RNA-guided DNA cleavage at targeted genomic loci. gRNAs were then designed targeting the replicons of native plasmids of ZM4 with about 100% curing efficiency for three native plasmids. In addition, CRISPR\u2013Cas12a recombineering was used to promote gene deletion and insertion in one step efficiently and precisely with efficiency up to 90%. Combined with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system was also applied to introduce minor nucleotide modification precisely into the genome with high fidelity. Furthermore, the CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system was employed to introduce a heterologous lactate dehydrogenase into Z. mobilis with a recombinant lactate-producing strain constructed.ConclusionsThis study applied CRISPR\u2013Cas12a in Z. mobilis and established a genome editing tool for efficient and convenient genome engineering in Z. mobilis including plasmid curing, gene deletion and insertion, as well as nucleotide substitution, which can also be employed for metabolic engineering to help divert the carbon flux from ethanol production to other products such as lactate demonstrated in this work. The CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system established in this study thus provides a versatile and powerful genome-editing tool in Z. mobilis for functional genomic research, strain improvement, as well as synthetic microbial chassis development for economic biochemical production.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is often reported to have emerged as a field of biotechnology in the early 2000s, with the convergence of engineering principles with biology (European Academies Science Advisory Council [EASAC], 2010). This time saw the first international meetings on \"synthetic biology\" and the beginning of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition (Gray et al., 2018). It also saw the emergence of a new lexicon that reflected engineering concepts, e.g., standardized \"parts\" (such as \"Biobricks\"), chassis, circuits, plug-and-play; and claims of a new scientific culture of greater collaboration facilitated by the standardization of processes across labs, and openness and ethical awareness (Crow, 2018). The rapid adoption of the term \"synthetic biology\" may have been facilitated by its use by a self-defining new generation of researchers from a variety of disciplines (Oldham et al., 2012) seeking to differentiate themselves from past controversies, and also avoid issues with attracting funding and public acceptance. However, the highprofile publication of the first self-replicating bacterial cell with a fully synthetic \"computer-designed\" chromosome in 2010 (Gibson et al., 2010), which was accompanied by headlines proclaiming that man had created life 13 , returned the spotlight on biotechnology regulation, and triggered new discussions on international regulatory oversight under the CBD. \n\nToday many definitions and descriptions of synthetic biology can be found, but there are none that are universally agreed or applicable to everything that may be labeled as such in the CBD discussions. Fields or sub-areas of biotechnology that may be referred to as synthetic biology in the scientific literature and example applications are listed in Figure 3. At its simplest, synthetic biology may be described as combining DNA or genetic \"parts\" in novel configurations to modify existing properties or to create new ones (Oldham et al., 2012). More broadly, there is a general consensus that synthetic biology is a dynamic and growing area of biotechnology that utilizes accumulated and constantly advancing knowledge and understanding in biological engineering, and advancements in engineering tools (Raimbault et al., 2016). As for recombinant DNA technologies (Berg and Singer, 1995), synthetic biology is expected to have a profound impact on our knowledge of fundamental life processes.",

They may also serve as nitrogen-fixing biofertilisers or be employed for their bioremediatory potential (1,2). Cyanobacteria may use solar energy as their energy source, CO 2 from the air as their carbon source, and, some of them, atmospheric N 2 as their nitrogen source. With such favorable basic characteristics, well developed molecular tools (3), and existing systems biology analyses (4), cyanobacteria are ideal candidates for a synthetic biological approach. \n\nFor some years the field of Synthetic Biology has been evolving (5)(6)(7)(8), and it is believed to be a future technology with high impact, connecting several research fields like genetic engineering, systems biology, protein design and computational modeling. Synthetic Biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems, as well as the redesign of existing biological systems for useful purposes (http://syntheticbiology.org). Basic principles of Synthetic Biology are: \n\n. the use of standardized and well characterized building blocks (BioBricks), . the hierarchical design of nature-inspired, artificial genetic circuits and proteins in silico, and . the use of chemical DNA-synthesis which allows production of DNA sequences that are not found in nature. \n\nThe BioBrick standard, originally proposed by Knight in 2003 (9), consists today of thousands of BioBrick parts, which are available at the 'Registry of Standard Biological Parts' (http://partsregistry.org). Biological parts are e.g. promoters, ribosome-binding sites, terminators, coding sequences and replication origins, all in a standardized format for easy assembly. The parts are flanked by a standard set of restriction sites and the assembly of several parts can be performed by established cloning techniques. With these features a rapid construction of newly engineered organisms is possible, and genetic constructs can easily be combined and exchanged between different research groups.",

            "text": "Tweaking regulatory elements like promoters, ribosome binding sites, and transcriptional terminators is key for fine-tuning gene expression in cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems. By modifying these elements, scientists can achieve a higher level of control over the transcription and translation processes, ensuring that proteins are made efficiently and accurately [13]. The field of synthetic biology has seen significant progress in developing computational tools aimed at customizing regulatory elements to fit specific needs. These tools, powered by sophisticated algorithms, including genetic algorithms and neural networks, are designed to fine-tune the activity of promoters, the effectiveness of ribosome binding sites, and the efficiency of transcriptional terminators. This approach allows for the tailored design of expression systems that can precisely regulate the production of proteins [25]. In wrapping up, the integration of computational modeling and design techniques is indispensable in refining CFPS for better protein production. From mathematical and simulation-based methods to advanced optimization algorithms, these strategies equip researchers with the ability to foresee protein synthesis outcomes, fine-tune reaction setups, and create DNA templates that lead to superior expression levels. Innovations in areas like codon optimization, the prediction of mRNA structures, and the engineering of regulatory elements have significantly enhanced the capability and adaptability of CFPS technologies, marking important strides in the quest for more efficient protein synthesis. Table 2 presents a curated selection of computational tools and servers dedicated to analyzing the various structural and functional features of proteins. Each entry details a specific computational resource, including its name, web address, and primary function, ranging from calculating physicochemical properties to predicting complex structural motifs such as transmembrane domains and disordered regions. The applications of these tools span a wide array of research areas, including but not limited to protein function prediction, protein-protein interaction studies, protein folding simulations, and drug design. This compilation serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to explore protein characteristics, interactions, and stability, contributing to advancements in fields such as bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biopharmaceuticals [26].",

            "text": "Bacterial expression system has been used for production of several recombinant proteins. Two major approaches can be used for enhancing the protein production. The first approach includes such methodologies that deal with optimization of culturing parameters such as pH, temperature, aeration, media formulations, concentration of inducer, use of appropriate strain etc. (Jaliani et al., 2014;Ranjbari et al., 2015;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). On the other hand, second approach utilizes such methodologies that deal at molecular level for improved protein expression. Molecular techniques manipulate certain genetic elements which may increase the protein expression level either at transcriptional or translational level (Makino et al., 2011). Synthetic biology enables us to create and use strong promoters such as T7, trc, etc. that allow us to achieve high expression level by increased transcriptional rate (Tegel et al., 2011). Besides, optimization of translational initiation region and codon optimization has also been utilized to overcome translational difficulties and codon biasness for enhanced protein production in a particular host (Tegel et al., 2011). In addition to that the effect of gene dosage has also been a crucial factor for protein expression level. Gene dosage has been studied in yeast as well as in bacterial expression system. Multiple copies of genes can be inserted in genome of yeast to study the effect of gene dosage for enhanced protein expression (Liu et al., 2020). However, gene dosage in bacterial expression system directly relies on expression vector copy number. Usually, plasmid copy number is increased for increasing the gene dosage in bacteria. This poses additional difficulties in growth and physiology of bacteria. The current study provides an alternate strategy for increasing the gene dosage without altering the copy number of expression vector (Kittleson et al., 2011). \n\nIn this study, we prepared an expression cassette having T7 promoter, 6X His-tag and gene for human epidermal growth factor in the backbone of pET28a (+) expression vector. The expression cassette was successfully multimerized to prepare the expression vectors with two and three copies of expression cassettes (see Fig. 1).",

            "text": "The fourth meeting in the BioSysBio conference series brought together international researchers in the interacting disciplines of synthetic biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. This conference was largely student-run, and as well as the formal talks included workshops, discussion sessions and a panel session on ethics, public engagement and biosecurity. A wide range of topics was covered at the conference, including modeling, biofuels and environmental bioremediation, metabolomics, structural and computational genomics, and software tools. Of note were the number of groups presenting improved models of metabolism, studying cellular subsystems such as cell death and circadian rhythms. Others are developing new approaches and standards for systems and synthetic biology, and significant improvements were reported for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts. A few highlights of the meeting are given here.\n\nS Sy yn nt th he et ti ic c b bi io ol lo og gy y a an nd d i it ts s s st ta an nd da ar rd di iz za at ti io on n Synthetic biology is a newly emerging field, where biological components are reengineered to provide new, designed functions. In a keynote lecture, Adam Arkin (University of California, Berkeley, USA) discussed the origins of synthetic biology and its scalability, as well as the engineering challenges that lie beyond the bioreactor. In his view, using synthetic biology, whether to meet an engineering or biological challenge, can be transparent, efficient, reliable, predictable and safe, unlike other human interventions such as selective breeding and the introduction of non-native species. Arkin also described ways of reducing the time and improving the reliability of biosynthesis, such as the use of standardized parts, computer-assisted design, and methods for quickly assembling parts. Evolved systems are complex and subtle, and he highlighted the fact that synthetic organisms need to deal with the same uncertainty and competition as do existing organisms.\n\nAmong the 'parts' required in synthetic biology are switches that can function, for example, as regulators of gene expression. Christina Smolke (Stanford University, USA) presented novel design strategies for constructing RNAbased molecular switches that can function as both biosensors and ligand-controlled regulators of gene expression.

            "text": "Modularity is a crucial aspect in the whole engineering world, as it enables to achieve predictable outcomes when different functional parts are interconnected [20]. Even if the successful interconnection of biological modules has been reported in many studies [13,21], most of them relied on trial-and-error approaches or time-consuming debugging of the constructed systems [15,22,23] and nowadays the behaviour of composite parts is hard to predict from individually characterized components. Recent efforts in such research have focused on model-based design and qualitative prediction of genetic circuits behaviour [13,24]. \n\nCrosstalk or incompatibility among components [1], contextdependent behaviour of parts [25], intrinsic noise that characterizes biological processes [26] and nonlinear effects on gene expression caused by cell machinery overburdening [27] are some of the limiting factors that contribute to the unpredictability of bottom-up-composed systems. For example, promoters activity may be affected by their flanking sequences and this contributes to the unpredictability of their behaviour when moved to a different physical context [25]. \n\nAs Synthetic Biology key concepts are based on engineering, the success of this emerging field depends on the definition of the working boundaries in which biological functions can be predictable, in order to enable the bottom-up composition of customized systems. Recently, some experimental studies have been reported to assess modularity of biological components. Davis et al. [25] proposed design rules to engineer insulation of promoters in order to improve their predictability when different DNA sequences surround them. Hajimorad et al. [27] reported the working limits in which the superposition of the effects could be valid in a model system composed by one to three independent gene expression cassettes as a function of the system copy number. Both works are promising starting points for studying context-dependent activity of biological parts and devices. \n\nHere, the modularity of transcription-based biological parts and devices has been investigated in ad-hoc constructed model systems. \n\nTo study the context-dependent variability of biological parts, the quantitative behaviour of promoters was studied in three increasingly complex conditions in E. coli, a popular chassis in Synthetic Biology.",

Recent years have seen an increasing number of synthetic-biology-based applications in fungi, emphasizing the need for a synthetic biology toolkit for these organisms. Here we present a collection of 96 genetic parts, characterized in Penicillium or Aspergillus species, that are compatible and interchangeable with the Modular Cloning system. The toolkit contains natural and synthetic promoters (constitutive and inducible), terminators, fluorescent reporters, and selection markers. Furthermore, there are regulatory and DNA-binding domains of transcriptional regulators and components for implementing different CRISPR-based technologies. Genetic parts can be assembled into complex multipartite assemblies and delivered through genomic integration or expressed from an AMA1-sequence-based, fungal-replicating shuttle vector. With this toolkit, synthetic transcription units with established promoters, fusion proteins, or synthetic transcriptional regulation devices can be more rapidly assembled in a standardized and modular manner for novel fungal cell factories.",

The benefit of modifying the baluloviral genome was already evident very early on, when the polh gene was removed from the viral backbone. Before, recombinant baculovirus had to be identifed by a specialist user observing the loss of occluded virus phenotype in infected cells, which occurred with very low efficiency. This improved considerably when the polh locus was disrupted, and dramatically when the baculoviral genome was linearized by endonuclease cleavage in the polh locus. The polh deletion was soon followed by further knockouts of genes non-essential in laboratory culture, which exhibited a negative effect recombinant protein production, notably v-cath and chiA, and others. Today, with the advent of powerful technologies to assemble large DNAs, the complete de novo synthesis of customized baculoviral genomes, devoid of unnecessary or detrimental elements becomes a genuine possibility. These synthetic baculoviral genomes containing multiple helper functions such as chaperones and modifiers and characterized by improved genomic stability, can be tailored to specific applications, for optimized, maximum level recombinant expression of target proteins.\n\nGenome engineering does not need to be restricted to the baculovirus.

Undoubtedly, it is much more demanding to engineer a eukaryotic cell. The advent of powerful genome engineering tools, notably CRISPR/Cas has revolutionized eukaryotic genome engineering with transformative potential. 50 We anticipate that these technologies will be profusely exploited in the near future to extend optimization to the host cell genome, to create specialized cell strains with defined functionalities.

Coupled with novel DNA assembly methodologies such as Gibson assembly [6], we have overcome the limitations of conventional cloning methods to enable the seamless assembly of combinatorial genetic parts, thus elevating our assembly capacity. Consequently, synthetic biologists can now even assemble entire chromosomes from chemically synthesized DNAs [6,7]. Concurrently, the development of genetic toolkits and genome editing techniques has revolutionized synthetic biology, enabling the manipulation of a wide range of organisms, including non-model ones which were previously considered difficult to manipulate, and expanding the arsenal of organisms that can serve as chassis, or biological platforms, for synthetic biology. \n\nRecent innovations in the \"building\" of biological systems have led to a drastic surge in the number of samples characterized in the \"test\" stage of the DBTL cycle. The increased rate of sample generation now exceeds the capacity of manual handling techniques, driving demand for high-throughput testing methods that use automation. As a result, biofoundries have been built worldwide, with several key facilities coming together to form the Global Biofoundry Alliance in 2019 [8]. In these biofoundries, a multitude of biological parts and systems can be built and tested rapidly through high-throughput automated assembly and screening methods. Such high-throughput technologies can then be leveraged by next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to collect large amounts of multi-omics data for cells at the single-cell level. \n\nDespite overcoming technical barriers in the \"building\" and \"testing\" biological systems to generate enormous amounts of biological data, synthetic biologists have faced difficulties in learning from big biological data. So far, the DBTL cycle's \"learning\" stage has proved challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems, the interactions between different components, as well as variations in experimental setups. Although synthetic biologists can sufficiently decipher data to create draft blueprints of the desired biological systems, many still resort to top-down approaches based on likelihoods and trial-and-error to determine the optimum design.",

To enable the possibility of genome modifications unconstrained through low-throughput and bespoke classical genome manipulation techniques, we set out to construct a baculovirus vector (>130 kb dsDNA) built from modular, chemically synthesized DNA parts. We constructed a synthetic version of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) through two steps of hierarchical Golden Gate assembly. Over 140 restriction endonuclease sites were removed to enable the discrimination of the synthetic genome from native baculovirus genomes. A head-to-head comparison of our modular, synthetic AcMNPV genome with native baculovirus vectors showed no significant difference in baculovirus growth kinetics or recombinant adeno-associated virus production\u2014suggesting that neither baculovirus replication nor very-late gene expression were compromised by our design or assembly method. With unprecedented control over the AcMNPV genome at the single-nucleotide level, we hope to ambitiously explore novel AcMNPV vectors streamlined for biologics production and development.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology, the rational engineering of cells to do useful things, is a bottom-up approach based on the foundational idea that standardized molecular \"parts\" can be developed from studying natural organisms [65]. These parts can be combined in circuits to control a cell's behavior, much like the programming of electronic circuits. The most basic parts-the promoter, RNA-coding sequence, and terminator-combine to form a \"transcription unit,\" a sequence of DNA that codes for the transcription of an RNA molecule (Fig. 2A). This RNA will then be translated into a protein which provides some functionality in the cell, or it will act to knock out the function of a native gene. Different combinations of these parts can produce complex synthetic devices: cellular logic gates, switches, amplifiers, memory elements and oscillators, as well as non-natural metabolism [66] . \n\nThe field is exemplified by two breakthrough genetic circuits developed in the early 2000s: the Collins group's construction of a genetic toggle switch that caused a cell to switch between two different states (e.g., producing or not producing a fluorescent protein) in response to external stimuli (e.g., heat) [67], and the Elowitz lab's \"repressilator,\" a three-part repressor system that induces periodic oscillations in production of a protein [68]. \n\nToday, synthetic biology has been used to create many successful commercial products, from medicines to food products to biomaterials [11]. However, compared to model organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae, relatively few biological parts and assembly methods developed for cyanobacteria so synthetic biology in cyanobacteria has been limited. Additionally, the thousands of parts that have been characterized for model organisms (see the iGEM BioBrick database for a large collection [69]) often do not function in cyanobacteria [70]. \n\nThe attraction in using cyanobacteria to convert CO 2 into useful bioproducts has led to increased genetic tool developments in recent years, by adapting existing parts from other species or deriving novel parts from natural cyanobacteria sequences.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is commonly defined through a two-branched definition that recognizes two approaches to constructing synthetic organisms: design of new systems and parts, and redesign of already existing ones (see Calvert, 2010). As we mentioned earlier, these two approaches are not completely independent and distinct: design and redesign activities often complement each other. Natural organisms can be incrementally redesigned to exhibit completely novel functionalities (Haseltine & Arnold, 2007). It has also been argued that very few constructs of synthetic biology can be described as thoroughly new. In truth, they are often for the most part modelled after natural organisms and even the most famous cases of organisms with wholly synthetic genomes should be described as cases of \"genome plagiarism\" (Porcar & Peret\u00f3, 2016: 451). \n\nHowever, despite the occasional ambiguity, we do think that the distinction between design and redesign allows us to discern some interesting points on how these two approaches compare to natural evolution as a method of exploring design space. For the purposes of our analysis, we define design as the activity of constructing systems and devices with novel functions. One of the most prominent examples of this strategy is rational design, an engineering-inspired method which proceeds through bottom-up construction from well-defined standardized parts (Cambray et al., 2011). As discussed earlier, evolutionary development of organisms tends to lead in time to increased complexity (though there are exceptions to this general trend). This complexity manifests itself both in the higher number of relevant traits, parts and interactions, but also in the increased integration of system design, decreased modularity and stronger coupling between organism and its environment. Rational design allows synthetic biologists to reduce biological complexity and simplify their systems through the use of modular parts, and by designing systems to be more engineerable (Ij\u00e4s, 2019). One of the main goals of rational design synthetic biology is to separate natural systems to simpler well-defined parts that can be manipulated and recombined with predictable outcomes. \n\nThis design of new-to-nature functions is contrasted with the strategy of redesigning already existing organisms. We consider redesign strategy including two conceptually distinct ways of approaching natural biological systems: as a starting point for further modifications, or as a model for alternative realization. We call these functional and structural redesign, respectively.",

Key steps during the last decades in on-going scientific efforts to understand, engineer, and develop methylotrophic eukaryotic microorganisms mentioned terminators can also find application in synthetic methylotrophic yeasts [25]. \n\nA remarkable knowledge gain was achieved in 2009 and 2013, respectively, by publication of the genome sequences of P. pastoris [26] and H. polymorpha [27]. Recombinant protein production is generally achieved using integrative vectors. Nevertheless, also episomal plasmids can provide a powerful tool to accelerate cloning and high-throughput screening, which is indispensable for synthetic biology approaches. Through the identification of heterologous and endogenous autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) of P. pastoris by genome mining, various efficient episomal expression plasmids could be constructed [28][29][30]. Also for other methylotrophic yeasts, such as H. polymorpha, plasmids containing an autonomously replicating sequence (HARS) derived from subtelomeric regions exist [31]. \n\nAnother recent groundbreaking event was the development of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system for P. pastoris. The latter enables genetic engineering via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) at an outstanding high efficiency [32]. In a subsequent study, a CRISPR-based synthetic biology toolkit for the chromosomal integration and assembly of multigene biosynthetic pathways in P. pastoris was developed, which enabled single-locus (~ 100%), two-loci (~ 93%), and three-loci (~ 75%) integration at high efficiencies [33]. In addition, CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated engineering tools were implemented for H. polymorpha [34].",

            "text": "With the avenue of in vitro DNA synthesis to generate larger fragments with increased fidelity along with novel assembly methods, we are now capable of generating large and custommade DNA molecules with the desired properties or even without the source of a DNA sample having only the sequence itself. New biological parts (genes, promoter sequence, terminators, etc.), devices (gene networks), and modules (biosynthetic pathways) are only limited by our imagination and the drive to create them. Also, without the advancement of methods for analyzing large amounts of data, bioinformatics, codon optimization software, genome mining, and user-friendly databases, synthetic biology creations are permeating in many laboratories around the world. With this in mind, we will review the current technologies for synthetic genes and genomes, and how this technology can be applied in generating novel regulatory circuits and even whole genomes. In this regard, E. coli is the key organism for such endeavors. Why? Well, in this section, we provide some examples that we consider may be helpful in the future of mankind and are in our opinion relevant in the field of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. \n\nSynthetic biology is a relatively new branch of molecular genetics that incorporate engineering principles for modifying several aspects of cell physiology, rewiring genetic circuits, creating novel circuits, and synthesizing custom-made DNA sequences and even genomes [87]. This particular branch of biology needs to be supported by an extensive knowledge of the organism that modifications or even whole genome synthesis is attempted, several novel tools for analyzing big datasets and molecular tools for that particular organism, for the generation of sequences and the computational design of DNA molecules, and a goal that can be achieved with the desired organism. E. coli along with Saccharomyces cerevisiae are the most studied and well-comprehended organisms in science, and diverse phenotypes have been identified that are helpful for bioengineering [88,89]. \n\nMultiplexing is the novel approach for redesigning organisms to do desired tasks [90]. By cycling through design-build-test framework we can achieve novel features in existing proteins and can further the advancement of genetic engineering. Thus far the most complicated and time-consuming part of this framework is the testing of the novel designs.",

            "text": "regulation, and metabolic engineering. The genetic design for genomic sequence modification in vivo can be achieved through different methods, including CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing, with an emphasis on maximizing on-target efficiency and minimizing offtarget effects [102]. Recently, rapid progress has been made in the development of new genome editing technologies, such as high precision prime editing [103], cytosine base editors [104], and adenine base editors [105]. These new technologies have been tested and adapted for genome editing in plants [106][107][108][109][110]. The design for modulating gene expression can be achieved through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa) systems, in which nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) is tethered to inhibitory and activating domains, respectively, to regulate gene expression [111,112]. CRISPRi may also be achieved with dCas9 alone acting on promoter or exonic sequences. In addition, RNA editing allows altering splicing or introducing nonheritable changes to protein sequences [113]. It is also possible to multiplex activation, repression, sensing, and emulation of gene expression using homologous CRISPR-sgRNA pairs or different CRISPR-associated RNA scaffolds, which can be potentially used to build complex synthetic programs [102,114]. For designing predictable gene circuits, genetic design automation (GDA) tools compatible with Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), such as Cello [115] and SBOLDesigner 2 [116], could be adapted to plants and used in an integrated fashion with the knowledgebase of biological parts to streamline the design process, as illustrated in Figure 7.",

This appraisal commences with a general overview regarding the manufacture of recombinant proteins by microbes and the production of biopharmaceuticals, their trends towards the development of biopharmaceuticals, and then discusses the approaches adopted for accomplishing this. The design of the upstream process, which also involves host selection, vector design, and promoter design, is a crucial component of production strategies. On the other hand, the downstream process focuses on extraction and purification techniques. Additionally, the review covers the most modern tools and resources, methods for overcoming low expression, the cost of producing biopharmaceuticals in microbes, and readily available recombinant protein products.",

            "text": "The marvels of DNA recombination technology have revolutionized the field of biotechnology. Several hormones, antibody subunits, vaccines, enzymes, and interferons are being produced at the industrial level, in suitable expression systems, under optimized conditions. For recombinant protein production, a range of expression systems are available such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, plant cells, insects and animal cells, etc. Each recombinant protein has different nature due to which it requires different challenges regarding the expression system and production conditions. Every expression system has its advantages and limitations on the basis of which it can be considered or rejected for a particular protein production. Therefore, it is very significant to investigate the potential and limitations of several expression systems to choose the suitable one for particular protein production at an industrial scale. The optimization criteria of an expression system is evaluated on several factors such as productivity, efficiency, physiological characteristics, total cost, safety, convenience, and down-streaming conditions. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae remained the organisms of choice to produce recombinant proteins for a long time, but now several other microorganisms are also being targeted to evaluate their efficiency toward recombinant protein production. Prokaryotic expression systems can be used to produce eukaryotic proteins as well however, the use of a eukaryotic expression system is preferable because it retains the structural, functional, and regulatory properties of therapeutic proteins. This review illustrates a brief view of a variety of expression systems, their efficiency, and limitations in recombinant protein production.",

In the early 2000's, a new philosophy emerged aiming at applying the principles of engineering: abstraction, standardization and quality control, to the Genetic Engineering. Tom Knight, from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, published a report entitled \"Idempotent Vector Design for standard Assembly of BioBricks\" [5]. The first paragraph of his report stated that: \n\nThe lack of standardization in assembly techniques for DNA sequences forces each DNA assembly reaction to be both an experimental tool for addressing the current research topic, and an experiment in and of itself. One of our goals is to replace this ad hoc experimental design with a set of standard and reliable engineering mechanisms to remove much of the tedium and surprise during assembly of genetic components into larger systems. \n\nStandard biological parts called \"BioBricks\" are pieces of DNA that form a functional unit such as promoters, coding sequences, terminators etc. They can be combined with vectors that allow assembling these parts in the desired order applying consecutively the same standardized techniques. The combination of different parts makes a \"device\" and several devices a \"system\". This standardization gave birth to the \"Synthetic Biology\", a discipline that can be defined as the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes [6]. To promote the use and knowledge about Synthetic Biology among undergraduate students the MIT group developed the \"International Genetically Engineered Machines\" (iGEM) competition [7] and pioneered \"The Registry of Standard Biological Parts\" [8], a collection of a few thousand BioBrick parts. Most parts of the registry are contributions of the iGEM teams that attend the competition and are shared with the community. Hundreds of projects have been contributed by iGEM teams revealing the incredible potential of the Synthetic Biology.

In recent years, the available devices and strategies for modifying cyanobacteria have been increasing, including advances in the design of genetic promoters, ribosome binding sites, riboswitches, reporter proteins, modular vector systems, and markerless selection systems. Because of these new toolkits, cyanobacteria have been successfully engineered to express heterologous pathways for the production of a wide variety of valuable compounds. Cyanobacterial strains with the potential to be used in real-world applications will require the refinement of genetic circuits used to express the heterologous pathways and development of accurate models that predict how these pathways can be best integrated into the larger cellular metabolic network. Herein, we review advances that have been made to translate synthetic biology tools into cyanobacterial model organisms and summarize experimental and in silico strategies that have been employed to increase their bioproduction potential. Despite the advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering during the last years, it is clear that still further improvements are required if cyanobacteria are to be competitive with heterotrophic microorganisms for the bioproduction of added-value compounds.",

            "text": "The pharmaceutical industry has long depended on synthetic chemistry approaches to develop novel therapeutics. These approaches, which have led to numerous breakthroughs in drug development, have typically relied on screening compound libraries populated by a range of molecules derived from a set of known and robust chemistry reactions in order to achieve improved efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties 1 . However, they often fall short when addressing complex diseases or diseases with genetic roots. Additionally, the cost and extended development timelines associated with these approaches have the potential to limit their application to emergent diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Synthetic biology, a field that has already had a significant impact on the agricultural, environmental, and renewable biofuel industries 2 , has emerged as an attractive alternative drug development approach. \n\nSynthetic biology is a scientific field that involves the rewiring of organisms or biomolecular parts for new and desired abilities. This encompasses diverse applications, from engineering new or improved activities in enzymes, heterologous production of commodity chemicals, assembly of genetic parts in a synthetic manner and developing cellular therapies. Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s 3 . These scientific breakthroughs allowed scientists to manipulate DNA in unprecedented ways and opened the door for a wave of innovation in genetic engineering, such as the invention of polymerase chain reaction in 1983 4 , which allowed researchers to amplify DNA sequences for use in genetic manipulation. Not long after, in the 1990s genomics emerged as a field that involved sequencing entire genomes and provided researchers with complete maps of genomes 5 , punctuated by the completion of the human genome project in 2003 5,6 . These technological advancements have since led to the creation of a vast and ever-growing catalog of cellular components and their interactions which, in-turn, has enabled a bottom-up approach to designing regulatory networks and circuits that can be used for the biosynthesis of various biochemical products (e.g., proteins and metabolites) 7 .",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a recently emerged field concerned with engineering complex living systems by assembling individually characterized biological parts in novel combinations. The discipline arose from the discovery of the mathematical logic of gene pairings, as well as from advances made in genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The development of de novo DNA synthesis, protein engineering, and the designs of artificial gene networks have greatly contributed to the field's advancement (Heinemann and Panke, 2006). Synthetic biology seeks to determine the behavior of organisms and their parts, and then to modify and combine them into complete specific tasks. The field is based on the engineering principles of design and fabrication and focuses on the concept of standardized parts (Serrano, 2007). Precise control over the levels of protein expression is an important requirement for the robust operation of complex synthetic circuits built from many parts. \n\nDespite improving characterization and assembly methods, cycles of design, fabrication, and testing in synthetic biology can be slow. Production of circuits with desired properties can require several rounds of testing and modifying, each time editing imperfect parts by mutation or identifying alternatives. Directed evolution has been shown to provide a short cut through this phase (Yokobayashi et al., 2002), but is complicated by the additional work needed to couple networks to selective pressures. Instead, use of predictive mathematical modeling to rationally guide the design of gene networks can greatly improve design cycles to accelerate advances in synthetic biology (Ellis et al., 2009). \n\nLevels of protein expression are affected by both the transcription and translation rates but early genetic engineering approaches usually focused solely on transcription (Lipniacki et al., 2006). The transcription rate's heavy dependence on the promoter strength and the relative ease of estimating binding affinity of RNA polymerase helped its early popularity (Alper et al., 2005). However, to gain more accurate and efficient control over protein expression translation rates must also be considered. \n\nTranslation initiation is one of the major steps in translation and plays a large role in determining the overall translation rate (Laursen et al., 2005;Kudla et al., 2009).",

            "text": "A large proportion of the recombinant proteins manufactured today rely on microbe-based expression systems owing to their relatively simple and cost-effective production schemes. However, several issues in microbial protein expression, including formation of insoluble aggregates, low protein yield, and cell death are still highly recursive and tricky to optimize. These obstacles are usually rooted in the metabolic capacity of the expression host, limitation of cellular translational machineries, or genetic instability. To this end, several microbial strains having precisely designed genomes have been suggested as a way around the recurrent problems in recombinant protein expression. Already, a growing number of prokaryotic chassis strains have been genome-streamlined to attain superior cellular fitness, recombinant protein yield, and stability of the exogenous expression pathways. In this review, we outline challenges associated with heterologous protein expression, some examples of microbial chassis engineered for the production of recombinant proteins, and emerging tools to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins. In particular, we discuss the synthetic biology approaches to design and build and test genome-reduced microbial chassis that carry desirable characteristics for heterologous protein expression.",

            "text": "This discrepancy between plant and mammalian systems also highlights the need for better predictive tools and computational models to bridge the gap between transient expression data or cell culture experiments and whole-plant behaviour. Importantly, such models must incorporate cell-type-specific contexts, as gene circuit performance can vary depending on developmental stage, metabolic state and environmental cues. Developing these tools, alongside standardised protocols, could streamline validation processes, minimize dependence on whole-plant regeneration and improve comparability across plant and mammalian systems. The switch-liker's guide 9 of 14 Despite these challenges, plant synthetic biology offers tremendous opportunities for innovation in agriculture, bio-based production and environmental sustainability. Advances in genome editing, synthetic promoters and modular genetic parts are paving the way for more efficient and precise plant engineering. Furthermore, the integration of computational models and high-throughput screening platforms could help overcome technical barriers and accelerate the design-build-test-learn cycle. By addressing these challenges and leveraging insights from microbial and mammalian systems, the plant synthetic biology community can unlock its full potential and drive transformative advancements in the field. \n\nWith the recent development of multiple plant synthetic gene circuit platforms, biotechnologists have a range of molecular tool options for developing trait-conferring circuits in crops. The choice between distinct operating principles, for example a memory circuit using recombinases (Bernab e-Orts et al., 2020;Guiziou et al., 2023;Lloyd et al., 2022;Maranas et al., 2024) or reversible circuits using transcriptional control (Anderson et al., 2023;Brophy et al., 2022;Ferreira & Antunes, 2024;Khan et al., 2024;Yang & Nemhauser, 2023), is important and will depend on the application and trait that is being pursued. For example, reversible expression may be appropriate for factors that confer resilience against transient environmental stresses, while it may be preferred to irreversibly trigger expression of a valuable biomolecule once sufficient plant biomass is achieved, to maximise production and limit effects on growth.",

Low transferring efficiency of a genetic molecule into the cell and ineffective expression of genes still act as high barriers to gene editing in this species. Therefore, it is still necessary to increase and optimize the efficacy of DNA or protein transfer systems for this algal species. The application of improved gene editing tools such as proteolistic method and improvement of promoter sequence and efficient gene expression cassette will increase the utilization of the system developed and verified in this study.

            "text": "The translational rate can also be a considered as a critical factor that might affect the protein expression. The translational rate of any recombinant protein might be affected by its mRNA secondary structures and the codon biasness of host. The 5\u2032 end of mRNA contains specific genetic elements such as initiation codon, Shine-Dalgarno sequences and enhancers that affect the rate of translation (Vimberg et al., 2007). Codon biasness can be overcome using codon optimization. In this modern era of synthetic biology, the codons that cannot be easily translated by the translation machinery of the host, are replaced by the ones that favor the efficient protein translation, hence overcoming the problem of codon biasness (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008;Elena et al., 2014). Besides that, vectors containing genes for expression of rare tRNAs can also be co-expressed in host cells to avoid the problem of codon biasness. This has been practiced using the Rosetta strains of E. coli (Novy et al., 2001). Use of some universal translation initiation tags might also improve the translation initiation rate and hence improved protein expression (Parret et al., 2016;Vimberg et al., 2007). \n\nGene dosage is another critical factor that might contribute to increase protein expression. The effect of gene dosage has been well studied in Pichia pastoris expression system, which provides opportunities for inserting more than one gene copy number in its genome, thus generating multicopy clones (Aw and Polizzi, 2013). The effect of gene dosage on expression of several recombinant proteins such as IFN\u03b12b, insulin precursor, etc. has been studied in Pichia pastoris expression system (Khan et al., 2014;Mansur et al., 2005). The gene dosage in bacterial expression system ultimately depends upon the copies of expression vector, as each vector contains single gene. For such studies, different plasmids having high, medium and low copy numbers are used (Chakravartty and Cronan, 2015;Friehs, 2004).",

            "text": "The past decade has seen significant advances in synthetic biology, in particular advances in our ability to write DNA and edit genomes (Adli, 2018;Khalil and Collins, 2010). It has never been easier to engineer living systems. Advances in synthetic biology in combination with advances in protein and enzyme engineering, expression and purification and metabolic engineering, have enabled numerous advanced cell factories for the production of proteins as well as metabolites or chemicals (Davy et al., 2017;Dhakal et al., 2019;Keasling, 2010). Among these cell factories, E. coli remains a workhorse microbe for the production of numerous products, including both proteins (including therapeutics) and small molecules (Davy et al., 2017;Hennigan and Lynch, 2022;Kamionka, 2011;Rosano et al., 2019). E. coli is well-studied and has well-developed high cell density culturing techniques, as well as established genome, metabolic and protein engineering tools (Elbing and Brent, 2019;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). \n\nAdvanced tools for genetic manipulation have made it easier to generate a wide diversity of strain designs, necessitating advances in higher throughput methods for testing or evaluating these designs (Leavell et al., 2020). This need has led to the development of numerous \"scale\" down systems to enable strain evaluation or process development at smaller scales in higher throughput (Bareither and Pollard, 2011;Blesken et al., 2016;Fink et al., 2021;Hemmerich et al., 2018;Janzen et al., 2019;Llad\u00f3 Maldonado et al., 2019;Maldonado, 2019;Rameez et al., 2014;Toeroek et al., 2015). While many of these \"microbioreactor\" systems offer significant advances when compared to traditional shake flask or microtiter plate cultivation methods, they are not readily accessible as they can be expensive and require significant adaptation to a given set of microbial strain variants and/or target product.",

            "text": "R ecent progress in the field of syn- thetic biology has led to the creation of cells containing synthetic genomes. Although these first synthetic organisms contained copies of natural genomes, future work will be directed toward engineering of organisms with modified genomes and novel phenotypes. Much work, however, remains to be done to be able to routinely engineer novel biological functions. As a tool that will be useful for such purpose, we have recently developed a modular cloning system (MoClo) that allows high throughput assembly of multiple genetic elements. We present here new features of this cloning system that allow to increase the speed of assembly of multigene constructs. As an example, 68 DNA fragments encoding basic genetic elements were assembled using three onepot cloning steps, resulting in a 50 kb construct containing 17 eukaryotic transcription units. This cloning system should be useful for generating the multiple construct variants that will be required for developing gene networks encoding novel functions, and finetuning the expression levels of the various genes involved. \n\nThe field of synthetic biology is progressing at a rapid pace, with the recent generation of organisms containing synthetic genomes. 1 While assembling complete genomes and rebooting cells with these is now possible, designing gene networks that encode new biological functions is still very challenging, even at a small scale. In fact, most genetic engineering work that has been performed to date has dealt with fewer than ten genes. 2 There are several reasons why this is the case. One reason is that until recently, the tools available for cloning and assembly of DNA fragments were still very limited (DNA fragments were, and are still, subcloned one or two fragments at a time), and required the design of construct-specific cloning strategies for each project, limiting the number of constructs that could effectively be made. Once cloning strategies were designed, multiple cloning steps were often needed to obtain the desired construct. Cloning steps were then performed manually in a slow and inefficient process that could not be easily automated. One additional factor limiting engineering work requiring multiple genes is that the design of constructs that would provide a desired phenotype cannot be determined entirely from sequence alone. Therefore, multiple construct variants have to be made, with the number of variants needed growing exponentially with the number of genetic elements involved.",

            "text": "One of the most efficient tools of synthetic biology is the Biobrick system, based on the use of standardized genetic parts that can be easily assembled to create new biological systems [3]. The Biobrick standard, developed by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, has since become a widely accepted standard in the field of synthetic biology [3]. Biobrick are DNA sequences that include promoters, coding sequences, and terminators, which are the basic building blocks of genetic engineering [3]. They are similar to electronic components in that they can be used to create complex systems by combining them in different ways. The Biobrick system also includes an archive of available genetic parts and a set of standard protocols for assembling and testing these parts [3]. One of the main benefits of using Biobrick is that they are exchangeable, meaning that they can be used in different biological systems without requiring significant modification [3]. This allows for the rapid and efficient construction of new biological systems, as well as the ability to test different combinations of parts to optimize performance [3]. Additionally, Biobrick are well-characterized, meaning that their function and behavior have been thoroughly studied and tested, which allows for greater predictability and reliability when building new systems [4]. Biobrick have been used in a wide range of applications in synthetic biology, including the production of biofuels, the detection of pollutants, and the creation of novel medical treatments. For example, Biobricks have been used to design bacteria that can convert plant material into biofuels, as well as to create biosensors that can detect pollutants in the environment [4].",

            "text": "Since Paul Berg and Peter Lobban each independently proposed an approach to generate recombinant DNA in 1969 -1970, recombinant protein has become a widespread tool for both cellular and molecular biology. For instance, in 2004, more than 75 recombinant proteins were used as medicine and more than 360 pharmaceuticals based on recombinant protein were under development [1]. Moreover, Elena's study indicated that the global market of industrial enzymes exceeded $4 billion in 2012 [2]. In the future, this figure can be raised considerably thanks to the applications of synthetic biology tools which will improve the productivity of recombinant proteins production. \n\nThe increment in recombinant protein productivity reduces a significant production cost, so it might dramatically raise profits. In order to improve the productivity, several aspects can be optimized such as purification process, culture medium and genetic materials (including operator, promoter, and gene). In this study, we only focus on gene optimization. \n\nIntroducing native genes into a host can cause incompatibility of codon usage bias, GC content, repeat region, Shine-Dalgarno sequence with host's expression system. The yields can fall down significantly [3][4][5][6][7]. In a culture medium, synonymous genes, which share the same operator and promoter, can be expressed at different levels. The synthetic codon optimized gene results in protein level that were ~2 to 22 fold greater than the amounts reported for the native genes [8][9][10][11][12]. A gene optimization program based on machine learning approach and experimental data can handle redesign task rapidly instead of using \"brute force\" method, which consume more significant times than other resources. \n\nThe foundation of gene optimization is a phenomenon of codon synonym. A codon is constructed by three ribonucleotides, so there are 4 3 = 64 codons (there are 4 kinds of ribonucleotides: A -Adenine, U -Uracil, G -Guanine and C -Cytosine). However, 61 types of codons can code for only 20 kinds of amino acids. This means there must be several amino acids encoded by at least two codons.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology uses biological insights combined with engineering principles to design and build new biological functions and complex artificial systems that do not occur in Nature (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006). The building blocks used in synthetic biology are the components of molecular biology processes: promoter sequences, operator sequences, ribosome binding sites (RBS), termination sites, reporter proteins, and transcription factors. Examples of such building blocks are given in Table 1. Great developments of DNA synthesis technologies have opened new perspectives for the design of very large and complex circuits (Purnick & Weiss, 2009), making it now affordable to synthesize a given gene instead of cloning it. It is possible to synthesize de novo a small virus (Mueller et al., 2009), to replace the genome of one bacterium by another (Lartigue et al., 2007) and to make large chunks of DNA coding for elaborate genetic circuits. Software tools to simulate large networks and the entire panel of omics technologies to analyze the engineered microorganism are available (for details see section 3). Finally, the repositories of biological parts (e.g. Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org/)) will increase in complexity, number and reliability of circuits available for different species. Currently, the design and synthesis of biological systems are not decoupled. For example, the construction of metabolic pathways or any circuit from genetic parts first requires a collection of well characterized parts, which do not yet fully exist. Nevertheless, this limitation is being addressed through the development and compilation of standard biological parts (Kelly et al., 2009). When designing individual biological parts, the base-bybase content of that part (promoter, RBS, protein coding region, terminator, among others) is explicitly dictated (McArthur IV & Fong, 2010). Rules and guidelines for designing genetic parts at this level are being established (Canton et al., 2008). Particularly, an important issue when designing protein-coding parts is codon optimization, encoding the same amino acid sequence with an alternative, preferred nucleotide sequence.",

            "text": "The major difference from historical approaches to biological modification is our newfound ability to precisely alter or augment biology in useful ways, leaning on our growing knowledge of how biology works across scales and advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis (6,7). When paired with an engineering mindset that brings together concepts of abstraction, standardization, and modularity (8), synthetic biology has been able to move beyond merely harnessing the inherent capabilities of biological systems and has pushed us toward creating entirely new-to-nature biological parts, devices, and systems (9,10). \n\nBiological engineering is distinct from other more established engineering disciplines because biology can adapt and evolve (11). Typically, human-engineered machines are designed according to a \"blueprint\" and consist of modular parts that can be studied using a reductionist framework. In contrast, biological systems have evolved and arise through self-organizing structures that adapt to changing contexts and environments. Living systems are also characterized by emerging multiscale structures that are complex and robust to change, the human brain being perhaps the best example. Furthermore, human-made machines often have a hardware-software duality where functions can be programmed and interrupted. Biological systems lack this separation, having their function and information processing embodied as part of the organism itself. Information is encoded not only in an organism's genome but also in the array of diverse components and processes making up each cell (12), e.g., the expressed proteins, metabolic fluxes, and cell membrane organization. \n\nThe ability for biology to evolve, i.e., its evolvability, can be both a blessing and a curse for synthetic biology. Evolution is a powerful engineering tool (13,14). However, it also allows biology to alter itself after deployment in unanticipated, potentially undesired, or dangerous ways (15)(16)(17). Directed evolution has become a routine tool in biotechnology for optimizing the function of biological components or systems (13,(18)(19)(20). Typically, a bioengineer creates a set of variants via random or directed mutagenesis or combinatorial recombination methods like SCRaMbLE (21). The library of variants is then screened via a selection procedure that retains the most performant designs.",

            "text": "Ultimately, the synthetic biology approach is geared toward the rational engineering or repurposing of biological parts, devices and systems into solutions that can help address societal challenges (Ausl\u00e4nder et al., 2017). Synthetic biologists envision a broad application space for the field and anticipate positive societal impacts in medical technologies (Pardee, 2018;Hicks et al., 2020) (e.g., biosensors and therapeutics), food security and sustainable energy (Russo et al., 2019;Roell and Zurbriggen, 2020) (e.g., biofuels and synthetic photosynthesis), bioremediation (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k et al., 2017;Wan et al., 2019) (e.g., pollution monitoring and sequestration), education (Kelwick et al., 2015a;Huang et al., 2018;Dy et al., 2019) (e.g., iGEM competition) and biomanufacturing (Le Feuvre and Scrutton, 2018;Choi K.R. et al., 2019;Gilbert and Ellis, 2019;Roberts et al., 2019) (e.g., fine chemicals and materials production). \n\nHowever, biological systems are highly complex and initial attempts at engineering biological systems to fulfill specific application goals, are often only partially successful. To help overcome these challenges, synthetic biology employs the concept of the design-cycle, through which biotechnologies are iteratively designed, built and tested (Arpino et al., 2013;Church et al., 2014;Kelwick et al., 2014). Learning how to improve a biological system may require multiple attempts, which could be made easier by more rapid and systematic workflows. One potential solution is to utilize cell-free synthetic biology for rapid prototyping (Moore et al., 2017b;Kelwick et al., 2018). Typically, cellfree reactions make use of isolated cellular components and machinery (e.g., ribosomes and recombinant proteins), rather than live whole-cells.",

            "text": "Plant synthetic biology endeavors to apply principles of abstraction, modularity and standardization to engineer plants for useful purposes (1,2). In support of this goal, the plant community adopted a common syntax, commonly known as the 'phytobrick' standard, that defines the features of DNA parts (3,4). For expression in plants, phytobricks can be assembled into synthetic genetic circuits using a number of plasmid toolkits including MoClo (5), Loop (6), GoldenBraid (7) and Mobius (8). These systems use Type IIS restriction endonucleases to direct onepot digestion-ligation assembly reactions, known as Golden Gate (9), that are easily parallelized and miniaturized for automation (10,11). Parallel DNA assembly has become an enabling technology for biofoundries, which specialize in automating the designbuild-test-learn (DBTL) cycle that underpins synthetic biology (12)(13)(14). \n\nPlants have long been exploited as sources of bioactive and high-value natural products (15), and recently, applications of model-informed synthetic biology approaches have led to sophisticated engineering of crop traits including biomass and responses to the environment (16)(17)(18). There is also growing interest and investment in the use of plants, particularly Nicotiana benthamiana, as photosynthetic platforms for the production of recombinant proteins and small molecules for industry and medicine (19)(20)(21), including rapid-response vaccines (22)(23)(24)(25). For many applications, methods to rapidly characterize protein functions are essential. This particularly applies to understanding the specific functions of members of large protein families such as decorating enzymes and transcription factors (TFs). However, for plant proteins, this is frequently a bottleneck, with researchers often investing considerable time and effort to identify permissive constructs and conditions to obtain useful yields before lengthy protocols to purify recombinant proteins for in vitro assays.",

The success of doing so has paved way for the application of such technology in various fields such as basic research, medicine and industrial application. \n\nThanks to the advances in systems biology as well as the emergence of new powerful tools that allow scientists to synthesise and create DNA, we are no longer limited to physical DNA samples isolated from organisms [10][11][12]. The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells. \n\nDespite this progress, one of the biggest challenges that exists within this field is our incomplete knowledge of how life works and the true complexity of the cells and their interactions. Though there have been advances in the field of DNA sequencing and gene technologies, the basic toolkit for synthetic biology lies with molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. The assembly of a system with these molecules is often complex as it requires a large amount of genetic reprogramming, DNA and protein synthesis as well as functional screening. The lack of understanding coupled with the complexity of each of these components make it a challenge to mimic the true nature of any biological system with high fidelity. Another major challenge of this field is the reliability and robustness of new biological systems implemented within living organisms [13]. \n\nSynthetic biology however is still closely tied to living cells. Though with the advantage of being able to reproduce, the use of a living cell still brings about four major challenges in synthetic biology. This includes the difficulty to standardise, its complexity, incompatibility and variability [14,15]. Therefore, from the standpoint of synthetic biology, it is desirable for these challenges to be overcome using a set of standardised engineering solutions. An interdisciplinary approach that has been adopted to address this challenge is that of cell-free synthetic biology.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is defined as the application of an engineering paradigm of systems design to biological systems to produce predictable and robust systems. We use ''synthetic biology tools'' here to specifically indicate the use of artificially designed genetic parts and networks. In this sense, the field began with the generation of transcriptional circuits in bacteria (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000;Gardner et al., 2000). Advanced techniques and tools have since been developed that allow engineering in eukaryotic systems, first in single cells and then in multicellular contexts (Cameron et al., 2014). One of the most recent advances in synthetic biology is the application of synthetic biology approaches to multicellular, developmental systems, a field dubbed synthetic development or synthetic morphogenesis (Ebrahimkhani and Ebisuya, 2019;Johnson et al., 2017;Santorelli et al., 2019;Schlissel and Li, 2020;Toda et al., 2019;Velazquez et al., 2018). One breakthrough in this area was the development of synthetic signaling pathways, often based on synthetic input-output devices that are controllable by the user: from optogenetic tools (Johnson and Toettcher, 2018;Kowalik and Chen, 2017;Toettcher et al., 2011) to synthetic receptors (Morsut et al., 2016). With these, researchers have generated synthetic signaling pathways that can trigger complex cell behaviors like differentiation, migration, and target cell elimination (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T [CAR-T] cells) (Roybal et al., 2016a(Roybal et al., , 2016b. One way these synthetic tools have been used is for building simplified in vitro systems; for example, for patterning of bacterial communities (Basu et al., 2005). How these tools have been used in developmental systems is the focus of this perspective.\n\nWhen we use ''developmental systems'' in this perspective, we mean metazoan multicellular systems, either reconstructed or natural, in vivo or in vitro, that display some form of patterning, morphogenesis, or differentiation: in short, development. Embryo models are one example of such developmental systems and are the focus of the journal issue of which this perspective is part. The specifics of",

            "text": "Nowadays, the genetic engineering of individual species or the entire metagenome based gene insertion, protein engineering, or plasmid/ virus augmentation remains restricted to laboratory scale due to their lack efficiency, and increasing environmental safety concern. The conventional genetic engineering tools were out spaced with recent advancements in genome editing and synthetic biology. Various genome editing tools like the CRISPR, TALEN, and ZFN enable the programmable modification of microbial genomes [114]. Other than deletion or gene insertion, these tools can be utilized for the overexpression or repression of certain genes [115]. The gene regulation by deactivated Cas (dCas) also improves environmental tolerance in the microbial species [116]. Genome editing also helps to customize microbes for the biosynthesis of novel enzymes and secondary metabolites [117]; thus, engineered microbes become the superior target as probiotics. The new approaches are heading for the biological designing or modeling of microbes in the whole genome-scale to obtain desirable phenotype. Accordingly, the introgression of synthetic regulatory gene circuits in living cells is required for broad-spectrum applications [118]. The combination of system biology and genome editing, along with sophisticated bioinformatics tools, may open up new avenues to solve the plastic problem. \n\nMoreover, the application of cell-free methods for protein-expression is another convenient way to produce enzyme and their broad-spectrum application [119]. The expansion of metagenomic techniques not only helps to identify novel genes and their functional analysis through heterologous expression but also reach up to the development of proteins with improved characteristic with the aim of tailormade solutions for specific problems. In these ways, metagenomics offers the extraction of more valuable information about the microbial world, and their biotechnological employment to resolve various social and environmental problems would be prioritized in the frontier of research.",

            "text": "The first tier of synthetic biology focuses on altering the general process flow-specifically modifications to the function and behavior of the process units (transcription [32] and translation) and the associated process streams (DNA, RNA [33], and protein). These manipulations are made possible through detailed knowledge of the central dogma process. While this capacity has existed for several decades [34], novel capabilities and genetic tools afforded by synthetic biology may help overcome some of the limitations and time-consuming bottlenecks inherent in established techniques. In this regard, synthetic biology aims to develop foundational technologies such as large-scale, economical de novo DNA synthesis [35] that would increase the efficiency of traditional recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering. Collectively, synthetic engineering of the central dogma aims to optimize and expand the capabilities of native cellular machinery. The methods and technologies developed from this research will contribute to a more powerful and efficient toolbox for the microbial engineer. \n\nIn this section, we will review synthetic biology technologies and applications for influencing components within the first tier. \n\n2.1. Engineering DNA. DNA manipulation began very early in the biotechnological revolution with recombinant DNA methods [36][37][38] and DNA sequencing technology [39][40][41]. Mutagenesis techniques and the establishment of standardized molecular biology methods [34] expanded these tools and empowered metabolic engineers with more powerful approaches to improve metabolic phenotypes [42][43][44][45][46]. Despite being straightforward and robust, these approaches are inherently limited by template-based DNA synthesis and restriction enzyme cloning. However, inexpensive, large scale synthetic (de novo) DNA manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize this process once again. Unlike traditional methods, de novo synthesis removes the need to engineer cellular systems using preexisting DNA as a template. In this regard, this technology brings about a new power to synthetically design genes, control elements, and circuits that do not exist in nature-thus creating novel function from the basic building blocks of nucleic acids and amino acids. Already, there are multiple companies with expertise in synthesizing DNA (Blue Heron, DNA2.0, GENEART, IDT, etc.), from small fragments to whole genes and genetic elements.",

            "text": "We have taken advantage of recent innovations in the field of synthetic biology, with the goal of improving episomal expression in Salmonella. Specifically, we incorporated synthetic insulated promoters as well as a synthetic transcriptional terminator into two expression plasmids, pFPV25.1 and pWSK29 (Valdivia and Falkow, 1996;Knodler et al., 2005). The resulting constructs enable predictable, tunable, constitutive expression of both heterologous and endogenous proteins and are a valuable addition to the study of host pathogen interactions, particularly at the single cell level. \n\nPreviously, we and others have found that plasmid-based expression of proteins can have deleterious effects on invasion and/or replication of intracellular Salmonella (Wendland and Bumann, 2002;Knodler et al., 2005;Helaine et al., 2010). While some of these effects may be avoided by chromosomal integration (Clark et al., 2009), it is often more efficient and practical to use plasmid based expression. Ideally, an expression vector should include a set of optimally configured genetic elements, of which two of the most important are the promoter, including a ribosomal binding site, and the transcriptional terminator (Hannig and Makrides, 1998). Often the major design goal is to maximize protein production, however when designing plasmids to be used in the study of pathogenesis, this must be balanced with the potential cost to the organism under a variety of environmental stresses. Here we replaced native components with synthetic biological parts that operate independently of either the genetic context or environment. The resultant series of pCON plasmids provide a straightforward approach to consistently and predictably produce proteins under a variety of conditions, while avoiding any negative impact on the host organism. \n\nThe use of synthetic promoters and transcriptional terminator in the pCON series of plasmids make protein production more predictable and consistent, however, as revealed by the comparison of GFP and mCherry production, insert-dependent variations are always possible.",

            "text": "Contemporary engineering enables computer-based design and accurate prediction of behaviour before any structure is built. For example, it is possible to analyse with significant accuracy the flight characteristics of a new aeroplane before construction has begun. At its most ambitious, synthetic biology aims to enable this for living organisms. By applying the engineering cycle of design-test-build-learn and founding principles such as standardization, automation and abstraction, synthetic biology aims to increase both the scale and predictability of biotechnology. \n\nThe phenotype of every living organism is dictated by a combination of the genes coded among the billions of nucleotide bases in DNA and the environment in which that organism lives. While genomics and metabolomics have enabled the identification of genes coding for enzymes responsible for biosynthesis, transferring these genes into new hosts requires regulatory elements that produce the correct quantities of each gene at the correct time. It also requires that proteins fold and function properly, that suitable quantities of metabolic precursors are available, and that the intermediates and end-products of the new metabolic pathways are not destroyed or used to make alternate products by the host cell. \n\nWe can now read, write and edit DNA with increasing fluency, facilitating the engineering cycle. Standardized DNA parts encoding regulatory elements can be designed and rapidly assembled in multiple combinations with enzymes that catalyse existing precursors into new compounds. These high-performance pathways can then be introduced to cells. In addition, genome engineering tools such as those derived from bacteria CRISPR/Cas9 systems can be used to remove genes from the host that encode products that use or break down the products of the new pathway. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the application of quantitative modelling is starting to inform how the design of new DNA and protein sequences inserted into host cells will influence their interactions with each other and with molecules present in the host to affect yield.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is often used to produce a variety of valuable chemicals, drugs, and biofuels in industrial biotechnology. A traditional method of gene knockout in E. coli was to adopt the Red homologous recombination system to mediate the homologous recombination of DNA. However, it is inefficient and especially not suitable for recombination of multiple sites (Murphy and Campellone, 2003). To improve the genetic engineering efficiency, Jiang et al. construct a triple-plasmid system as mentioned above. This novel genetic engineering tool significantly improved the efficiency of genetic modification and thus accelerated the development of industrial biology. In previous studies, Cas9 and gRNA were expressed in two plasmids, respectively, as the simultaneous expression would burden the organism metabolism and cause cell death. Hence, Cas9 or gRNA should be repressed before a genome editing event. Cas9 and gRNA can be assembled into one plasmid containing a pBAD promoter, which is repressed by glucose and induced by arabinose and a temperature-sensitive replicon repA101ts, so that transformed E. coli could grow on glucoseamended plates and be edited under the induction with 2 g/L of arabinose. This fast and easy procedure for genome editing could perform continuously, as multiple loci only required one plasmid construction and one step of transformation. To further improve the simultaneous editing efficiency of multiple loci, a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique was developed. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique contained three plasmids: pRedCas9 containing both \u03bb-Red recombineering and Cas9 system under the control of pBAD promoter, pMgRNAs containing gRNAs, and pDonorDNAs carrying multiple donor DNA cassettes (Feng et al., 2018). In another versatile study, Li et al. firstly coexpressed a plasmid containing a gRNA targeting the bla gene and Cas9 with the \u03bb-Red recombineering system into E. coli (Li et al., 2015). Then, the genetic editing started with cotransformation of donor DNA and gRNA plasmid into preceding cells.",

            "text": "Following the concepts of synthetic biology, we have developed a database framework that compiles genomic data into a genecentric database of M. polymorpha genetic parts. The database will be a useful resource for mining novel genetic components and designing new constructs for plant synthetic biology. We have shown that using predicted promoter elements defined in MarpoDB, we could drive expression of fluorescent reporters in planta. We observed distinct gene expression patterns of the fusions, confirming that compact promoter elements are capable of driving gene expression. Whilst these promoter elements were able to drive gene expression, we suspect that native expression is not entirely recapitulated. However, the fact that they are capable of producing distinct expression patterns makes them useful parts for genetic engineering. Furthermore, we have shown that MarpoDB is an efficient tool for extraction of genetic parts for DNA fabrication as common syntax standard parts. The major novelty of MarpoDB is that it stores genetic sequences in a modular fashion, following synthetic biology definitions of standard genetic parts. In combination with the recode tool, this approach allows users to integrate M. polymorpha genomic data directly into the common syntax (Fig. 4), implicitly defining modular part level descriptions for higherlevel design and assembly. Since genes are defined as part assemblies, adding new synthetic constructs to the database as recombination of existing parts becomes simple. In the future, submission of genetic parts and gene descriptions by users will provide a parts registry for the wider plant synthetic biology community. \n\nWe have shown that MarpoDB can be used for batch retrieval of M. polymorpha parts by fetching a promoter library of transcription factors and recoding them for type IIS assembly. Recoding of sequences to the common syntax provides the standardization required for generating reusable, shareable libraries of heterologous plant DNA parts. This library will be expanded to include promoter elements and CDSs of other genes of interest and sent for DNA synthesis, thus creating a physical library of M. polymorpha parts. Collecting information from individual parts used in different contexts will show how a part performs under different settings. Further characterization of the modules will provide the data for understanding compatibility between the parts, and development of design rules for the construction of synthetic circuits in plants.",

            "text": "The Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle of synthetic biology represents a systematic and efficient workflow for the optimization of biological systems for specific functionalities (e.g., strain improvement). Complex genetic systems can be constructed in a modular manner with desired features-synthetic regulatory tools and rewired expression of biosynthetic pathways-enabling an affordable genetic engineering of biological systems. Synthetic transcription units can be rapidly assembled by cloning methods supporting the assembly of multiple DNA fragments [e.g., Gibson Assembly (Gibson et al., 2009) or USER Cloning (Geu-Flores et al., 2007)], or high-throughput, modular cloning methods, such as Golden Gate cloning-based (Engler et al., 2009) Modular Cloning (Weber et al., 2011), andGoldenBraid (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2011) assemblies. With these methods, genetic parts (promoters, coding sequences, and terminators) can be arranged into transcription units, where the building blocks are interchangeable within the same synthetic biology language, but their order and orientation are commonly predetermined. Collections of such DNA building blocks (toolkits) have been established for bacteria (Moore et al., 2016), yeasts (Lee et al., 2015;Obst et al., 2017), plants (Engler et al., 2014), mammalian host cell lines (Martella et al., 2017) and also for filamentous fungi (Sarkari et al., 2017;Hernanz-Koers et al., 2018;M\u00f3zsik et al., 2021b;Dahlmann et al., 2021). These toolkits can provide backbone vectors to facilitate modular assembly and fungal delivery, or pre-assembled vectors containing various genetic elements, suitable for generic applications or specific needs. The deposition of such toolkits containing ready-to-use, established DNA parts or modules, highly accelerates the biological DBTL cycle for synthetic biology applications. A major repository for genetic parts is Addgene, a free online database that facilitates the exchange of genetic material between laboratories around the world.",

            "text": "It was reported that proteins with large molecular weight or those that harbor several membrane domains pose a far greater tendency to form insoluble aggregates and are prone to proteolysis [10]. Moreover, additional challenges include mimicking eukaryotic post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation) [11], production of harmful endotoxins (E. coli) [12], reduced cell viability resulting from unwanted by-products [13], and low protein yields [14]. To tackle these obstacles, different recombinant DNA technologies, including manipulation of gene expression control [15][16][17], directing proper bond formation and protein folding [18,19], interfering host metabolic pathways [20,21], random or directed evolutions of bacterial strains or enzymes [22], and series of other methods have been systematically employed (summarized in [23]). While these engineering strategies already provide practical solutions for the expression of various protein forms, the engineered expression systems can further be optimized to achieve a better performance. \n\nFunctional protein expression has met a dramatic shift paralleled with the advances in systems and synthetic biology; that is, data-driven understanding in systems biology has provisioned a knowledge-based framework on which to rationally design, build, and test biological entities in an increasingly sophisticated manner [24]. For instance, the following have altogether enabled characterization of the bacterial host and recombinant proteins at the systems level: a large influx of high-throughput information on DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites that enabled visualization of the global landscape of transcriptional and translational processes [25,26]; availability of robust computational tools and in silico models streamlining detailed analysis and prediction of the cellular networks; and rapid advances in DNA synthesis, assembly techniques that facilitated the process to build and test the designed biological systems [27,28]. Such new schemes provide one possible way around biological uncertainties; that is, by systematically eliminating genetic redundancies, it is expected to minimize the confounding effects of unknown genetic elements and to reduce metabolic interference from native metabolic pathways while endorsing more predictable regulation of cellular functions [24]. This, in essence, would help to further improve the performance of the extant microbial cell factories.",

            "text": "While this review largely focuses on biomaterials and genome editing for correcting and modeling human disease, there have been some recent developments wherein genome editing has been used to produce new biomaterial platforms. Excitingly, genome engineering allows for the modification of genes coding for natural biomaterials. These strategies contribute to a new branch of synthetic biology wherein these gene editing tools can be harnessed to create chimeric proteins or protein variants that can drastically change the material behavior and properties of the natural environment (13). Using these tools, engineered protein biopolymers can be designed and produced that have domains with different functionalities that modulate cell signaling, introduce novel amino acids or modifications, and provide inorganic binding domains for drug delivery (14). For example, smart biomaterial platforms have been created using purified Cas12a protein along with DNA-conjugated hydrogels, wherein Cas12a is used as a trigger for the release of various cargo, including cells and small molecules and proteins (15). Genome editing can also improve the biomanufacturing of biomaterials. Spider silk, which has a variety of desirable properties, can be mass produced in silk worms (16) or yeast (17) that have been genetically modified. Commercially, biomanufacturing offers a chance to generate new classes of materials inaccessible via conventional manufacturing methods. The facile production of libraries of thousands of variants of biomaterials from living organisms [or even in a cell-free manner (18)] enables rapid screening and identification of compositions with novel and improved functions. Recently, Zymergen has released Hyaline, a biopolymer film that was biofabricated in genome-edited living organisms (19). Hyaline has potential uses in touch-screen displays, circuit boards, and foldable electronics. As high-throughput genome editing technologies continue to advance alongside increased automation and machine learning, several novel biomanufactured materials will likely emerge in the coming years (20). and expression. Furthermore, the total dose of Cas9 delivered to each target cell is very difficult to control due to differences in the amount of DNA each cell receives as well as cell-to-cell variability in expression levels.",

            "text": "Synthetic Biology (SynBio) consists of deliberate alterations to achieve desired functions or the creation of specific components that, through transcription and translation, enable organisms to function as expected under multiple stress conditions in biological systems. To accomplish this, the combination of principles from biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science drives these modifications. Another technique that is part of SynBio is Artificial Intelligence (AI), as it incorporates various genetic model algorithms that contribute to faster, more efficient, and more precise improvements, with neural networks and support vector machines being two prominent models. Furthermore, gene editing mediated by CRISPR is a genetic engineering tool that enhances crop yield and tolerance [168]. Among the available tools in SynBio, the CRISPR-Cas system enables more precise genetic editing, which will be discussed below. \n\nThe set of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated with a protein (Cas) (CRISPR-Cas) recognizes and cleaves exogenous viruses and plasmid DNA in bacteria, forming the acquired immune system of prokaryotes. CRISPR-Cas is divided into two subtypes: Class I includes an effector protein with a specific function in the CRISPR system, while Class II has an effector protein with multiple functions within the CRISPR system. Subtype II corresponds to CRISPR-Cas9 [169] and CRISPR-Cpf1 (also known as CRISPR-Cas12a). These two gene-editing systems have been applied to filamentous fungi, with studies showing that Cpf1 was more efficient in Aspergillus niger, whereas Cas9 was more effective in Fusarium venenatum. Single-gene editing involves small and large insertions/deletions (indels) and substitutions. To increase cellulase production through Rasamsonia emersonii, Cas9 was used to edit small indels, targeting the ACE1 gene and leading to the deletion of 1-2 bp of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence, rendering ACE1 non-functional. In large indels, the CRISPR-Cas system introduces two double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which are repaired through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to chromosomal fragment deletions.",

We have devised Mobius Assembly for Plant Systems (MAPS), a user-friendly Golden Gate Assembly system for fast and easy generation of complex DNA constructs. MAPS is based on a new group of small plant binary vectors (pMAPs) that contains an origin of replication from a cryptic plasmid of Paracoccus pantotrophus. The functionality of the pMAP vectors was confirmed by transforming the MM1 cell culture, demonstrating for the first time that plant transformation is dependent on the Agrobacterium strains and plasmids; plasmid stability was highly dependent on the plasmid and bacterial strain. We made a library of new short promoters and terminators and characterised them using a high-throughput protoplast expression assay. Our results underscored the strong influence of terminators in gene expression, and they altered the strength of promoters in some combinations and indicated the presence of synergistic interactions between promoters and terminators. Overall this work will further facilitate plant synthetic biology and contribute to improving its predictability, which is challenged by combinatorial interactions among the genetic parts, vectors, and chassis.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology can be described as an amalgam of wet-lab techniques from genetic engineering, modeling techniques from systems biology and design concepts from electrical and control engineering. 1,2 The goal of synthetic biology is the ability to build biological \"circuits\" or networks made using individual components such as genes and promoter regions, that produce a desired behavior. The process by which this goal should be attained is unclear, and therefore the precise definition of synthetic biology is also unclear. 3 However, the success of synthetic biology depends on a few key ingredients: efficient design process, standardized engineering protocols, 4 and some form of modularity 5 allowing one engineer to build on another's work. The potential of such a technology is immense for understanding fundamental science or solving real-world problems. By constructing oscillators, 6-8 bistable switches, 9,10 noise controlling networks 11 and synchronizing circuits, 12 synthetic biologists are able to bring theory of biological systems into practice. For the purpose of realworld application, synthetic biology may become a key player in bioremediation, 13 drug production 14,15 and bio-fuel production. 16 While synthetic biology has great potential, it is important to understand the present limitations. There are unresolved issues at several levels: wet-lab protocols, exchange of information and computational modeling. Synthetic biology relies on the hypothesis that biological parts or functional elements encoded as DNA, can be assembled in order to build circuits with predictable behavior. 17 Wet-lab protocols for assembling biological parts are time-consuming and labor intensive, especially when building large circuits. For the purpose of sharing, there are no standard Computer-aided design of biological circuits using TinkerCell protocols for exchanging complete parts between research labs, including the DNA sequence and information about the part's function. For computational analysis, there is no clear consensus on what types of models are best suited for reliably predicting biological circuit behavior, especially in the presence of so many unknown parameters in an average synthetic circuit. Nonetheless, it is equally important to realize that significant progress has been made to address each of the above issues. Standardized assembly has made exchange of parts between labs easier. 18,19 Design strategies have been explored for controlling uncertainty due to noise 20 and parameters. 21 Modeling methods have been demonstrated to be predictive for steady state behaviors of cells, 22,23",

These yeasts have a genetic code variation in which the leucine CUG codons are instead decoded as serine. The authors developed a new and efficient transformation system for Metschnikowia and an additional 21 yeast species, providing new platforms for genome synthesis and engineering efforts. \n\nProtein expression is an essential methodology for biochemical studies, including those mentioned above, as well as for the production of biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies and therapeutic peptides. Chen et al. [10] used a high-throughput approach to screen for the impact of the expression of any E. coli gene on cell growth. The most significant impact on E. coli growth was observed upon the overexpression of membrane proteins. Interestingly, the authors found that for certain proteins, the use of lower copy number plasmids stabilized cell growth rate and increased overall recombinant protein yields. The impact on cell growth could also often be remedied by amino acid supplementation. Using a related methodology, Schwark et al. used a fluorescent protein reporter system and investigated an E. coli release factor deletion strain with a highly efficient archaeal orthogonal AARS tRNA pair. Their data suggested that the engineered strain will be a highly useful tool for applications requiring the incorporation of multiple ncAAs [5]. \n\nA major ethical responsibility for synthetic biologists is the ability to retain control or confinement of genetically modified microorganisms. This drove the field to develop fascinating and effective methods for containing microorganisms in the lab that are commonly referred to as biocontainment. Some of these approaches included the use of genetic code expansion to create synthetic auxotrophs, such as an E. coli strain dependent on ncAAs for growth [21]. Diwo et al. further extended this idea with their novel formulation of an 'alien genetic code' [12]. The authors presented the concept that an ideal biocontainment system would involve the creation of microbes with genetic codes that are totally incompatible or 'alien' to the natural genetic code.",

They highlighted virulence factors and host proteins that could be modulated or engineered to affect the rates of AMT or broaden the host range of A. tumefaciens. Since that time, cheap, accurate DNA sequencing and tools to precisely edit genomes, such as CRISPR/-Cas9, have spurred major shifts in the technology used to study biological systems. The field of synthetic biology, which seeks to rationally design and engineer biological systems to generate predictable, useful outcomes, has also rapidly matured. While perhaps most prominently utilized in the field of metabolic engineering, synthetic biology has also been invoked to rewire other complex biological phenomena such as nitrogen fixation [7], respiration through changes in membrane viscosity [8], and altering the plant cell wall [9]. This engineering is predicated on the existence of wellcharacterized DNA elements that can precisely control the expression of genetic circuits; however, we still lack the DNA parts needed to enable complex and fine-tuned engineering efforts in Agrobacterium. \n\nIn this review, we focus on recent advances in the understanding of Agrobacterium-host interactions that may serve as targets for synthetic biology approaches to increase the potency of A. tumefaciens as a tool for precisely engineering a broad range of plants. Furthermore, we highlight technological advances in the delivery of T-DNA to host cells, as well as the current repertoire of genetic tools available to control gene expression in A. tumefaciens. Finally, we discuss which areas the field may focus on to improve the control of Agrobacterium-based genetic circuits in the future.",

            "text": "Under this operative definition, the relationships are determined by physical interactions between molecules. Depending on its functionality, their parameters can be expressed as: dissociation constants, association or dissociation rates, and rates of change (production or degradation), among others. The strength of the interaction is related to the parameter value (intensity) and the function persistence. \n\nAs far as bioengineering is concerned, although shaping a biosynthetic system in a modular way is clearly advantageous, it is a complicated task. In an ideal scenario, when constructing a synthetic system, parts would be interchangeable. In that ideal case, the system would be easy to maintain by renewing its parts and replacing any one prone to failure. Under this scheme, the parts could be integrated and interchanged in different ways to achieve new functions. \n\nIn Endy (2005), the author stresses the main challenges limiting the development of synthetic biology. Among them, he mentions \"an inability to avoid or manage biological complexity\" and \"the tedious and unreliable construction and characterization of synthetic biological systems. \" He suggests considering lessons from engineering, which could be valuable for synthetic biology nowadays. He mentions that, from his point of view, the three ideas most relevant for synthetic biology may be standardization, decoupling, and abstraction. The decoupling idea is intimately related to the capability of defining independent modules, which could work separately or coupled. Referring to standardization, the definition of a standard bio-part may need the consideration of retroactivity in order to define independent parts or to include standard insulators as part of the synthetic biologists toolbox. \n\nAnother work relating modularity with synthetic biology is (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006) where the authors emphasize the role of modules in synthetic biology: \"At the module layer, the synthetic biologist uses a diverse library of biological devices to assemble complex pathways that function like integrated circuits. The connection of these modules to each other and their integration into host cells allows the synthetic biologist to extend or modify the behavior of cells in a programmatic fashion. \" They also emphasize how modules are embedded in host cells, which they modify and by which they are modified themselves. We will come back to this topic later.",

            "text": "As a discipline, synthetic biology aims to fully characterize the genetic elements it needs to build new genetic circuits and modify the behavior of organisms. The field terms these elements as parts, which acknowledges the intent for each genetic element to be used in a modular fashion. For example, promoters, repressors, and reporters can be used again and again in disparate studies with the hope that each part will perform consistently. This has led to the creation of a parts registry [62] and a database where increasing numbers of biological parts are added [22]. Several coordinated efforts have been aimed at defining and refining each part for not only their activity but quality [6,41].\n\nThis collective effort to produce modular and standardized genetic parts to aid in synthetic biology applications is bolstered in large part by community building [21]. Apart from international conferences, the field of synthetic biology is fed by the recruitment and activity of young researchers through the highly active International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), which has been held annually since 2004 [63]. As a requirement for this student competition, each group contributes new parts and refinements of parts to the BioBricks database. Such collection and standardization of parts can be used to build not only devices such as logic gates [37], but also larger and larger systems [44], using the principles of engineering.",

            "text": "Over the past 15 years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability to control and regulate gene expression. The molecular techniques used to accomplish this are typically referred to as synthetic biology \"tools\". Collectively, the synthetic biology and metabolic engineering communities have developed large sets of standardized tools and genetic parts -promoters, terminators, ribosome binding sites, riboswitchesto control gene expression in the common microbial hosts E. coli and S. cerevisiae (Blazeck et al., 2012;Chen et al., 2013;Lee et al., 2015;Salis et al., 2009;Win and Smolke, 2007). Dynamic range can be greater than 1000-fold (Salis et al., 2009), inducibility and feedback regulation have been demonstrated (Xu et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2012), and combinatorial refactoring of pathway expression is possible (Pfleger et al., 2006;Young et al., 2018). Genome-wide tools that create pooled libraries of mutants with targeted gene regulation have also been developed (e.g., MAGE, Tn-Seq, and TRMR; see (van Opijnen et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2009;Warner et al., 2010)). The recent discovery and widespread adoption of CRISPR-Cas9 and associated interference and activation systems (CRISPRi and CRISPRa) have enabled similar gene regulation abilities in a wide range of both model and non-conventional hosts (L\u00f6bs et al., 2017b;Schwartz et al., 2017b;Sidik et al., 2016). \n\nThese gene regulation tools are most often demonstrated (and standardized) with the model protein and fluorescent reporter GFP and its variants. Fluorescent proteins provide a useful functional screen to characterize newly developed tools: GFP is highly soluble, cytosolically expressed, and florescence readouts can readily provide quantifiable signals from bulk cultures and at the single cell level. The experimentally supported conclusion from the GFP model system is that transcription directly correlates with expression and function. That is, changes in transcript level produce equivalent changes in protein abundance and function.",

Recently, a set of transfer plasmids, called OmniBac, combines the options to use both the Tn7/BAC system and classical heterologous recombination approach using the same entry reagents, thus allowing exploitation of the advantages of either system without having to reclone the heterologous genes of interest. 16,17 Protein expression has drawn vast benefit from advances in synthetic biology and recombineering technologies that allow targeted modification of the baculovirus genome. 10,16,18 Most platforms for virus production now rely on engineered viral genomes in which genes considered to be detrimental for protein production or stability have been deleted. Among the first genes that were removed following the original polh deletion are v-cath and chiA, that encode a cathepsin protease and a chitinase, respectively, which are involved in the liquefaction of infected larvae. 9,19 This was followed up by elimination of further genes (p10, p26, p73). 20 The loci for v-cath and chiA are juxtaposed in the viral genome, and this region has been utilized to insert genes encoding maker proteins such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or sea anemone red fluorescent protein (dsRed), as well as chaperones or post-translational modification enzymes by site specific recombination, thus generating novel functionalized genomes (Fig. 2B). Additions can include kinases, phosphates as well as enzymes that allow to synthetize complex carbohydrates found on many secreted proteins of mammalian origin. 10,21,22 Synthetic biology is emerging as a profound game-changer in the life sciences and synthetic biology approaches are opening up entirely new avenues that may transform recombinant protein production in the future. We are only beginning to scratch at the surface of what is possible. The design and synthesis of the entire one megabase Mycoplasma mycoides bacterial genome has been achieved. 23 We now have all tools in hand to entirely rewrite the 130 kilobases baculovirus genome and create synthetic versions comprising only DNA elements essential for laboratory applications.\n\nSynthetic baculoviral genomes with improved genetic stability and customized for optimal protein",

Also, this same year the Cambridge team presented a E. coli genetically engineered to produce a variety of colored pigments that they called Escherichia chrome [12]. The Sevilla team project for the 2011 competition was the design of bacteria that can operate as logic gates and thus per-form simple logical operations [13]. In 2013, the Freiburg team developed a toolkit that enables customizable gene regulation in mammalian cells based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system [14]. \n\nThe standardization of reusable parts and methods allows students to develop complex projects in few months. The potential of the Synthetic Biology is enormous, and can engineer from scratch complex genetic circuits, metabolic pathways or even whole genomes. A search in the Web of Science for papers mentioning Synthetic Biology reveals that from the few papers that appeared in 2004, the number of publications have exponentially grown to near 900 in 2014 and the number of citations to more than 11000. \n\nIn the words of Tom Knight: This is going to change how we build things.

Furthermore, in order to improve the efficiency of MAGE, the conjugative assembly of genome engineering (CAGE) method was developed, which permits large-scale genome modification by assembling modified genome parts. Combining these two techniques, researchers successfully demonstrated the ability to replace all the TAG stop codons with TAA in E. coli (Isaacs et al., 2011). The engineered strain has a free TAG codon that could be used in areas such as the incorporation of unnatural amino acids.\n\nEven with these powerful synthetic biology tools available, functional construction of synthetic systems is still hindered by the hidden and complex regulation in the host cell. This fact requires that genetic components be well characterized and mutually orthogonal. Researchers recently developed a systematic process for refactoring the nitrogen fixation gene cluster, in which they changed the codons of essential coding sequences and put them under the control of synthetic parts, separated by synthetic spacer sequences (Temme et al., 2012). By removing the native regulations, the underlying interactions are simplified, which facilitates the engineering of the nitrogen fixation system in a non-nitrogen-fixation host. All the above-mentioned synthetic biology approaches provide systems biologists new tools to understand gene functions and complex genetic regulatory networks.",

Over the past decades, B. subtilis has comprehensively been developed as a workhorse for the secretory over-production of numerous recombinant proteins and high value-added chemicals that are widely used in industrial biotechnology [1][2][3][4]. Several industrially and pharmaceutically used recombinant proteins are biosynthesized and actively exported into the extracellular milieu, employing powerful genetic elements and native highly efficient secretory translocation systems [5][6][7][8][9][10]. It also naturally produces many valuable biochemicals, such as poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid, riboflavin, surfactants and antimicrobial peptides [11][12][13][14]. After successfully sequencing of the genome of B. subtilis 168 [15], more and more groundbreaking studies focusing on the fundamental sciences, such as biosynthetic pathways, the omics-driven system biology for metabolism [16][17][18], the cell-cell signaling pathway [19], and the mechanisms of controlling key metabolic intersections [20], have been performed. More importantly, booming technologies in B. subtilis, such as the DNA assembly [21], the CRISPR/ Cas9 and ssDNA strategies for genome editing [22][23][24], and large-scale genome reduction [25], etc., provide a great push for developing B. subtilis into an ideal chassis for synthetic biology. \n\nIn synthetic biology, it is generally regarded that the designer functions in living chassis are performed by gene circuits, which directly exert diverse tailor-made devices, such as tunable oscillations [26], Boolean logic [27,28] and pattern formation [29] and so on. These achievements rely on gene circuits of increasing size and complexity so that biological engineers must finely adjust the expression level of many different genes at a time.",

In turn, this allows the rapid access and cross-comparison of information that is critical to establishing data quality and creating interoperability standards that will enable biologists to leverage their efforts and build scalable systems.\n\nThe key observation that biological systems exhibit some degree of modularity underlies the current belief that useful and 'engineerable' design principles exist [8]. Whether at the level of protein motifs with similar binding properties or groups of proteins that carry out specific functions in a variety of distinct settings, the modular parts of biological systems are used and reused to generate and control the apparently complex behavior of living organisms. The bold question that was asked at the dawn of recombinant DNA research, and continues to be asked today, is whether a growing understanding of this modularity and new tools to manipulate it can be used to engineer new and useful behavior. Attempts to directly answer this question -and to think about its consequences -have resulted in the formation of a loose assembly of scientists, engineers, ethicists and other thinkers engaged in what has become known as 'synthetic biology'.\n\nWhat sets synthetic biology apart from molecular biology and its closely allied fields of genetic and metabolic engineering is the ambition to formalize the process of designing cellular systems, in the way that traditional engineering disciplines have formalized design and manufacture, so that complex behaviors can be achieved for practical ends. Such behaviors will require larger biochemical circuits, typically encoded in DNA, for control. To achieve this, synthetic biologists look to move beyond the qualitative and often ad hoc engineering pathways that have underlain the slow progress to this point. The goal, instead, is to create a systematic engineering science founded on the standardization of a cellular 'chassis' -the types of parts available, their manufacture, their characterization and protocols for their interconnection -analogous to those that underlie and enable the scalability of mechanical, electrical and civil engineering. But the analogy with traditional engineering should not be taken too far, as there are challenges to engineering biology that no internal combustion engine or microprocessor has faced.",

            "text": "Genes can be transferred successfully from one organism to another, and the level of gene expression and activity can be changed using different promoters and/or copy numbers of the genes or balanced with rates of degradation. The gene editing system CRISPR makes genetic changes easy [15] (even with commercial kits being offered to the home market (e.g., [64]).\n\nChallenges remain in several areas. One of the most overlooked aspects of living systems is the amount of inherent noise. In efforts to program organisms with precisely designed genetic constructs, it is often the case that the construct does not perform as intended, due to the variability produced by the host organism. One challenge on this front is to understand how to modulate or control the inherent noise to an acceptable level (if possible) or to understand how to use the inherent noise to the benefit of the system. Related to that challenge is how to produce sustainable genetically modified systems using standard genetic elements such as plasmids. Genetic circuits can function in a host cell for minutes to days before the system becomes nonfunctional, typically due to the loss of plasmids over time. The development of sophisticated feedback mechanisms may allow for sustained function of genetic constructs over time. Again related to the above challenges is the challenge of understanding the toll on the fitness of the engineered organism. How does the metabolic burden manifest itself, what are the underlying mechanisms, and are the effects additive?\n\nStandardization and modularity continue to play a primary role in the refinement of synthetic biology research and practices. With the development of tools and techniques in synthetic biology, deeper questions in biology may become experimentally tractable: for example, the nature of noise, attractor states, embodiment, mutation regimes, biological optimization, and information transfer, to name a few. So far, most of these considerations are appropriately considered for short time scales, for example, from hours to days of functionality. The long-term visions of genetic manipulations are not clearly defined, although they are being discussed. Although synthetic biology provides more control over genetic systems, the limits to the amount of engineering possible in biological systems are yet to be elucidated.",

The new strain, consisting of the so-called sender cells, secreted AHL molecules into the medium where co-culture was grown. When these molecules reached a sufficient concentration and were near the so-called receiver cells, controlled by AHL, they initiated the production of RFP ( Figure 13). Through this experiment, the researchers illustrated that the two genetically modified cells coexisted in co-culture while producing BC capable of creating red fluorescence. Perhaps more significantly, this study revealed that it is possible to grow materials that autonomously detect borders between different populations of genetically modified cells and induce gene expression only at those specific locations. Figure 12. Overview of standard synthetic biology methods that are utilized for the development of living and functional BC-based hybrid materials; (a) synthetic libraries comprise modular DNA parts (including promoters, ribosome-binding sites (RBSs), coding sequences (CDSs), and terminators) which can be joined together into gene constructs for transformation into a host microorganism, such as yeast (circles) or Komagataeibacter (rods); (b) genetically modified cells secrete cellulose nanofibers into their surroundings and gradually form a BC pellicle within which they are contained; (c) BC pellicle encompasses living genetically modified cells that can sense and react as a response to selected externally applied signals, such as light, chemicals, and diffusible signaling molecules (adapted from Singh et al.

            "text": "In practical terms, this separation of biological design from DNA assembly enables innovation within these hierarchies to occur at different rates. For instance, it is generally true that with more recent DNA assembly methods it is currently easier to assemble multi-part genetic circuits consisting of several bioparts, or even entire genomes, than it is to reliably predict how these bioparts will interact in the final system (Purnick and Weiss, 2009;Ellis et al., 2011;Arpino et al., 2013;Ellefson et al., 2014). However, it is envisioned that this will change, with the increasing adoption of high-throughput characterization platforms that can test entire biopart libraries in parallel. These platforms typically use automated liquid-handling robots, coupled with plate readers although microfluidics approaches are also gaining traction (Lin and Levchenko, 2012;Boehm et al., 2013;Benedetto et al., 2014). In either case, when coupled with automated data analysis, modeling, and sophisticated forward-design strategies (Marchisio and Stelling, 2009;Wang et al., 2009;Esvelt et al., 2011;Ellefson et al., 2014;Marchisio, 2014;Stanton et al., 2014), these high-throughput platforms provide the basis for the rapid prototyping workflows required to realize a synthetic biology design cycle (Kitney and Freemont, 2012). \n\nIn this review, we focus on several significant tools, both classical and emerging, that the field of synthetic biology employs as part of a typical design cycle workflow. Building upon a design cycle template, the review is organized to explore prominent tools and research methodologies across three core areas: designing predictable biology (design), assembling DNA into bioparts, pathways, and genomes (build), and rapid prototyping (test) (Figure 1). We first describe several of the core challenges that are associated with designing predictable biology, including the complexities associated with chassis selection, biopart design, engineering, and characterization. In parallel, we highlight relevant tools and methodologies that are particularly aligned with the engineering principles of synthetic biology.",

            "text": "The feasibility of terpene synthesis in Y. lipolytica has been demonstrated. Rapid advancements in gene editing technology and improvements in gene editing tools have promoted the application of Y. lipolytica in synthetic biology [ 16 , 17 , 19 ]. Although the construction and optimization of gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 have alleviated the limitations of low HR efficiency, there is still a large gap compared with model organisms such as S. cerevisiae. Thus, more efficient gene editing tools still need to be developed. \n\nIn addition, optimizing the protein folding efficiency of strains is a potential strategy for constructing terpenoid cell factories in the future. Many proteins are expressed during the construction of terpenoid cell factories, which increases the burden on the endoplasmic reticulum and thus affects protein folding efficiency. The unfolded protein response (UPR) in yeast cells is regulated by various transcription factors such as HAC1 [ 94 ]. Improving the efficiency of protein folding and conformational modification by regulating the expression of UPR-related transcription factors will contribute to the construction of microbial cell factories. \n\nOptimizing the usage of carbon sources is also an emerging research direction in synthetic biology, which is important for the concrete implementation of sustainable development strategies. The use of nonfood-based carbon sources such as xylose [ 95 ] and methanol [ 96 ] has received increasing attention. \n\nIn addition, the dynamic regulation of product production by dynamic regulatory systems is another direction worthy of attention. The dynamic regulation system based on transcription factors or hormones has been applied to regulate the production of naringenin and other compounds [ 97 ]. Rapid screening of naringenin-producing strains was achieved by regulating leucine biosynthesis using the flavonoid transcriptional activator FdeR and its manipulator FdeO [ 98 ]. \n\nFor terpene production, the combination of strategies mentioned above can effectively improve terpene yield, but the same strategy may produce very different results for diverse products. In the future, rationalizing metabolic network modeling at the genome scale could provide an in-depth perspective that may produce a series of universal strategies for terpene accumulation.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology uses engineering principles to enable the rational design of genetic constructs with 20 predictable behaviour. Many advances have been achieved towards the design of novel genetic and 21 metabolic pathways of increasing complexity in the past decade [1][2] [3]. In recent years, research 22\n\nhas also been devoted to design considerations where predictability is a challenge, such as situations 23\n\nwhere retroactivity, toxicity of protein products and long-term instability of DNA constructs are 24 crucial to successful implementations [4]. While these construct-centric issues are progressively 25 being addressed, contextual issues such as interactions between constructs and the host cell are 26 much less understood. As a result, the behaviour of synthetic gene constructs in living cells can be 27 hard to predict [5] and often a large number of iterations are necessary to obtain a construct that 28\n\ncan function adequately in the context of a specific host [6][7] [8]. In this review we discuss the most 29 important research advances in the characterisation of host-construct interactions in bacterial cells 30\n\nfor synthetic biology, paying special attention to recent work that identifies insights and rules to help 31 future design of synthetic constructs. Rather than discuss the specific interactions that various 32 enzymes and pathways have on host cell metabolism, we focus here on interactions that are general 33 for all synthetic constructs, such as their use of host resources for maintenance and expression. 34 35\n\nPart I. Impact of synthetic constructs on host cell physiology 36\n\nCells possess a finite pool of resources needed for biological processes such as replication, 37\n\ntranscription, translation and enzymatic reactions. Depending on the environment and growth 38\n\nconditions, cells must allocate their resources to different tasks in order to maximise their fitness 39\n\n[9,10]. The introduction of heterologous DNA constructs represents a challenge for the cell that 40\n\nalters the fine equilibrium of resource allocation [11,12]. This unnatural extra load typically leads to 41 slower growth and lower protein yields [13], a phenomenon known as burden (Figure 1a) an extra load that can decrease host cell fitness. One way to address this problem is through careful 51 choice of expression determinants within a genetic construct, such as the promoter and ribosome 52 binding site parts. These can have a significant impact on the output of the system but also",

            "text": "Bacteria are widely used in science and industry as cell factories for production of recombinant proteins. The choice of bacterial host and expression system relies heavily on the origin and properties of the heterologous protein. Today, the most commonly used bacterial hosts for expression of heterologous proteins are the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. E. coli is in many cases the most used host due to several advantages, including an extensively developed genetic tool box, well-known genetics and physiology, low-cost media, and rapid protein production in a short fermentation period [1]. However, this species also exhibits some limitations as the heterologous proteins are typically expressed intracellularly, which results in problems with formation of inclusion bodies and incorrect protein folding. B. subtilis, on the other hand, has become an industrial workhorse for recombinant protein production due to an easy cultivation, the products of its metabolism being generally recognized as safe (GRAS), ease of genetic manipulation, well-characterized expression systems, absence of significant codon bias, and exceptional ability to secrete heterologous proteins allowing cost-effective downstream processing. Lacking an outer membrane, B. subtilis can efficiently secrete recombinant proteins to the culture medium, therefore this bacterium is more suitable for the production of secretory recombinant proteins than E. coli [2,3]. Challenges in recombinant protein production in B. subtilis have typically been related to the activity of cell-wall-associated proteases interfering with folding of heterologous proteins in the interface between cell wall and extracellular space. This has later been ameliorated with the use of genome editing to remove the genes coding for interfering proteases [4][5][6]. Further work on B. subtilis to improve its properties as a host for heterologous protein production has been done, including Morimoto et al. (2008) demonstrating that a 20% reduction of genome size resulted in a proportionate increase in recombinant protein yields at the cost of lowered growth rates [7].",

            "text": "The workflow starts with in vitro construction and in vivo amplifying of combinatorially assembled DNA fragments to generate gene modules. Terminal homology between adjacent assembly fragments and the plasmids allows generating diverse construct in single cloning reaction. In each module, the gene expression is controlled by library of regulators 39 . To decrease the turnaround time in bioengineering projects, CRISPR/Cas-based editing strategies are implemented for multi-locus integration of multiple groups of modules into loci, whereby each group is integrated into a single locus of different microbial cells 39 . Sequential rounds of cloning enable the construction of entire pathway in a plasmid. The established plasmid can be either transformed into the host (e.g. VEGAS method 43 ) or be used for single-or multi-locus integration into the microbial host genomes to generate combinatorial library (e.g. COMPASS 39 ). Therefore, combinatorial optimization projects require tools and methods to assemble parts in genetic circuits, to change DNA sequences, and to integrate DNA pieces into the genome of an organism 31 . Here, we discuss two important synthetic biology tools: \"advanced orthogonal regulators\" and \"advanced genome-editing tools\", as well as the recently established combinatorial optimization strategies. \n\nAdvanced orthogonal regulators. Constitutive promoters are typically used to express heterologous genes in microbial cell factories, but this is often metabolically burdensome as the formation of the product competes with cell growth and proliferation 8 . Hence, auto-inducible (or self-induction) protein expression systems were established to pair growth and induction of recombinant proteins at desired time 44 . The system utilizes a cell density-based control module that allows tight regulation of the transcription of the recombinant gene; at low cell density, its expression is negligible while at high cell density expression is high. Such cell density-based control systems usually employ the quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms from Vibrio fischeri implemented in E. coli. However, these systems require the use of an extra plasmid for the production of proteins under control of the regulatory elements, which might be undesirable, particularly when multiple genes must be expressed.",

            "text": "The Registry of Standard Biological Parts (www.partsregistry. org), based on the original vision of Tom Knight, is providing a rich collection of components for synthetic biology projects. Several articles in the PLOS ONE collection reflect the importance of this resource. For example, a global analysis of the Registry clone collection [13] helped identify certain discrepancies between the sequences recorded in the database and the physical sequences of some clones in the collection. These results prompted a change in the quality control of the submissions to the Registry that has greatly improved the overall quality of the collection. Moreover, the analysis of parts usage patterns led to organizational guidelines that may help design and manage these new types of scientific resources. As most parts in the registry are for prokaryotes, a eukaryotic collection of 52 parts was developed and is available for distribution [14]. This includes multiple cloning sites (MCS), common protein tags, protein reporters and selection markers, amongst others. Furthermore, most of the parts were designed in a format to allow fusions that maintain the reading frame. \n\nAs well as standardized coding regions, synthetic biology projects require well-characterized promoters to achieve desired expression strengths. In one study, a single yeast promoter was mutated to make a fine-graded output range promoter library [15]. Transcription Activator-Like Orthogonal Repressors were then developed synthetically to control expression of these promoters in an orthogonal manner. Such orthogonality or 'non-cross-reactivity' is necessary for engineering larger synthetic gene circuits that do not interfere with the physiology of the biological chassis in which they operate. Mammalian synthetic promoters have also been developed by analyzing motifs found in highly active human promoters. Thus, by modulating the amount of sequences rich in GC and CpGs, custom designed promoters were obtained [16]. \n\nFinally, entirely de novo parts that are found nowhere in nature have been engineered to slot into biological systems. Using E. coli lacking conditionally essential genes, entirely new functional proteins were obtained from scaffolds of randomized 4-helix bundles, rescuing stalled growth [17]. Similarly, a synthetic ATPbinding protein, evolved entirely from non-natural sequences, was expressed in E. coli, altering the levels of intracellular ATP [18].",

            "text": "Synthetic biology could be presently applied to systems with reverse genetic tools and have developed resources such as genomic sequence, selection markers, plasmid vectors, various promoters and genetic editing tools. However, these are presently being limited to selected microalgal species. The microalgal models that can be congenial to reverse genetics and synthetic biology perturbations based on the existing genetic resources are available for C. reinhardtii, Nannochloropsis sp., P. tricornutum, Cyanidioschyzon merolae, Ostreococcus tauri and Thalassiosira pseudonana [70]. Traditionally, most of the applications of synthetic biology have been carried out in a model microalga, C. reinhardtii, where existing tools are being modified and optimized, synchronous with the development of novel tools. Therefore, in C. reinhardtii, protein production has been accomplished by engineering the chloroplast genome because reverse genetics and editing methods could be attempted in chloroplasts. With the development of expression constructs [80,81], protein production has been recorded to reach 80 times more in chloroplasts than that of nuclear expression [82,83]. Attempts have been made to alter the algal photosynthetic machinery by synthetic biology via expression of heterologous genes (gene psbA that codes D1 subunit of Photo system II) in chloroplasts as \"Biobricks\" under the influence of endogenous regulatory system [84]. Efforts have also been carried out to engineer Rubisco under varying external environment, to enable optimized utilization of energy and carbon. This was carried out by altering the amount of rbcl mRNA (large subunit genes of Arabidopsis Rubsico) maturation factor MRL1 from the nuclear genome of MRL1-deficient mutant. Rubisco content has been reported to reduce by 15% in comparison with the wild type, with no reduction observed in their growth. Interestingly, in the presence of inducible promoters, Rubisco amount could be altered under varying light intensity and CO 2 concentration, as shown by Johnson [85]. Key events that mark the development of synthetic biology in microalgae-based oil accumulation are illustrated in Fig. 3.",

            "text": "The goal of synthetic biology to standardize the engineering of biology while scaling the design of novel cell functions to increasing complexities critically relies on the reliability and predictability of synthetic biological components 1,2 . Challenged by constantly mutating endogenous interactions, designed synthetic molecules with specific functions can be quickly made unstable or non-functional by variations in host physiology or genetic makeup. For these reasons, tools are being constructed to shield the functions or predict the behaviors of synthetic genes in the cell. These tools include the design of robustness to evolutionary instability 3 and molecular context 4 in addition to the application of computational algorithms in the design of molecular parts to ensure robust function 5 . \n\nGenome-wide mapping of the gene-to-phenotype relationship has enabled the effective identification of genetic targets to improve complex traits in bacteria, such as tolerance to ethanol 6 , cellulosic hydrolysate and isobutanol 7 . However, knowledge of the genotype-phenotype relationship does not necessarily allow engineering of reliable heterologous pathways in these strains. To achieve this capability, a systematic understanding of cell-function-to-pathway interactions enabling accurate whole-cell models of the biochemical networks is necessary 8 . \n\nHere, the cell function-to-gene expression interaction was investigated for all non-essential genes in the E. coli genome. Specifically, both the global and specific effects of the lack of a cellular component on cell biomass and synthetic gene expression were mapped. The global effects may involve both the ability of the cell to grow and the cellular amount of a synthetic component. Perturbations in the synthetic circuit dynamics of this type of effect may include growth feedback and have been described mathematically 9 . Alternatively, a cell function can have a localized effect, such as an effect on the output of synthetic genes but not on cell size. Therefore, to investigate the sequence-specificity of the effects of cell function loss, the present study used a genetic construct with two identically expressed reporter genes. \n\nThe results indicated that most functional disruptions affected both cell size and synthetic gene expression and caused an analogous positive or negative shift. Phenotypic patterns of the cell-expression interaction were mapped to 4 major systems in the cell: membrane function, RNA-ribosome-protein stability, biosynthetic and energy-motility functions.",

In the future, we will also have a wide variety of validated bolt-on modules, including regulatory componentry (based on transcription factor sets and global response cascades), product export componentry and titre-boosting componentryall of which will require minimal tailoring for the product of interest. \n\nThe future of the microbial cell factory industry will be underpinned by rapid advances in computer-aided design, genome construction and high-throughput multiplexed robotic strain development/testing. Powerful new tools such as CRISPR will also play an important role. CRISPR is a game-changing technology from two respects. First, the remarkable power of the technology for genome editing is already delivering applied results in diverse fields. In the context of development of microbial cell factories this provides the potential for rapid retro fitting of the already-developed chassis for closely related applications. Second, CRISPR has broken new ground in regulatory legislation. In the United States, the decision has been taken that a CRISPR-modified organism is not a GMO, since no foreign DNA has been introduced into the cell. This likely means that the deployment of CRISPR-modified engineered organisms can happen far more rapidly, once initial approval has been provided for the original chassis. \n\nOur current limitation remains our basic understanding of cellular biology and, in particular, our ability to rapidly and predictably engineer that biology. However, that understanding is expanding very quickly, and as it does, we accelerate towards our ultimate goal to achieve bespoke design and implementation of whole-cell microbial machines. Eventually, we may have a design-build-deploy capacity for microbial machines (Vickers, 2016) that will allow us to rapidly deliver economically competitive bioprocesses. This will help us build a more sustainable future through the use of renewable feedstockscurrently agricultural products, but ultimately waste materials (e.g. gas fermentation) and direct photosynthesis (e.g. using cyanobacteria)to produce the vast array of chemicals required to support the modern lifestyle of humanity.",

A good example is the potential prediction of translation initiation sites, which is useful for localizing proteincoding gene sites during computer-assisted annotation of bacterial and archaeal genomes [102], and prediction of putative genomic sequences that correspond to functional RNA motifs [103], or prediction of gene expression levels with new combinations of genetic elements [75]. \n\nEven experimental verification of the translation efficiency determined by any binding site in a model system cannot guarantee that an identical efficiency will be achieved if the coding region sequence is replaced. Such is the case due to secondary structure formation when the coding region and the 5' UTR are complementary. A study using specially designed bicistronic constructs was conducted in order to increase the predictability of the expression level of any gene expressed in a heterologous system. In that study, a conventional short open reading frame was located upstream of the reporter coding region whose expression efficiency was measured by flow cyto metry. The reading frames overlapped within the randomized translation re-initiation site. Therefore, it was found that re-initiation eliminates the dependence of the translation efficiency on the coding region of the second gene. Both gfp and rfp were used as the second gene in this synthetic operon. The resulting expression levels of these different genes correlated well with each other [75]. \n\nHence, experimental determination of the expression efficiency by flow cytometry or Flow-seq can be directly and reliably employed for generating expression constructs in synthetic biology.",

Recently, characterization of promoter and upstream element sequences have enabled specific ranges of gene expression to be realized [70][71][72]. Similarly, emerging techniques that use small regulatory RNAs to target specific genes appear to be especially well-suited for implementing Constrictor predictions. The CRISPR interference system, which uses a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein to inhibit transcription of genes homologous to a guide RNA sequence, has been demonstrated to be tunable according to the location of the DNA target [73]. Implementing riboregulators is another strategy for achieving modular expression from selected genes [74]. In light of these and other advances in synthetic biology and genome engineering, it is becoming increasingly possible to achieve precise performance from biological parts, which allows for enhanced integration of strain engineering efforts and in silico predictions.",

            "text": "One of the desired outcomes in molecular farming is to achieve a high-expression yield of recombinant protein. To achieve high-expression yields of recombinant proteins, expression constructs must be optimized at all stages, from transcript to protein stability. Recently, it has been suggested that guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the gene of interest does not affect recombinant protein accumulation alone. Another important driver is codon-anticodon kinetics, which may be a major driver for translation efficacy [19]. Codon bias can result in a gene from one species being poorly expressed in another host organism as a result of the presence of unfavourable codons [20][21][22][23][24]. Correlations between the use of host-specific codon usage and the accumulation of correctly folded, active-recombinant protein should be identified. The yield of recombinant protein can therefore be improved through codon harmonisation, which involves replacing messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) codons with those that are preferred by the host [25]. \n\nPlant expression vectors are typically chimeric structures that have been constructed from repurposed plant viruses, such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), alfalfa mosaic virus, and potato virus X (PVX) [26]. The latest virus-based vectors are the deconstructed vectors that have non-essential genes of the virus replaced with the coding sequences of the genes of interest or those that drive high levels of translation. Viral vectors are used because of their ability to replicate at high quantities. The most well-known transient expression system, the MagnICON system, relies on constructs with a TMV and a PVX backbone [27]. A popular alternative is the pEAQ-HT expression system, which is based on the CPMV and a variant that improved plant transient expression though the rational design of synthetic 5 and 3 untranslated regions, giving rise to a pHREAC expression system [28][29][30]. Cloned recombinant genes within these constructs are bordered by various regulatory elements.",

The biofoundries, such as the London and Singapore biofoundries, provide cost-effective access to high-cost equipment and small-scale prototype evaluation to other academic laboratories and companies. 57 tablishment of public biofoundries requires substantial public investment, time, and trained personnel and thus, they are typically found in nations, particularly those in Asia, with a national synthetic biology program and a well-defined bioeconomy roadmap. \n\nBiofoundries can significantly accelerate the engineering of biological systems by providing higher reproducibility and throughput and ease of sharing of standardized protocols. As other nations, such as India, formulate their bioeconomy strategies, 58 biofoundries have the potential to be at the core of a nation's synthetic biology capabilities. \n\nThe vital role that biofoundries play in synthetic biology is evident from some of the success stories from the existing biofoundries. For instance, in the eminent \"10 molecules in 90 days\" pressure test taken on by the Foundry at the Broad Institute, 59 six of the challenged molecules or their close relatives were successfully produced within the given time constraint. In another study, the biofoundry at the University of Manchester produced 17 potential material monomers in 85 days. 60 The London Biofoundry contributed to the rapid development and validation of automated SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnostics 61 . \n\nApart from a demonstration of capabilities, such drills also identified key bottlenecks in further accelerating the engineering process.",

However, efforts have been recently expanded to other hosts including Streptomyces species (Medema et al., 2011), Corynebacterium glutamicum (Becker and Wittmann, 2012), yeast (Krivoruchko et al., 2011;Siddiqui et al., 2012;Furukawa and Hohmann, 2013), and algae (Wang et al., 2012;Gimpel et al., 2013). This expanded landscape seeks to take advantage of the natural capabilities to synthesize precursors and cofactors required to produce a particular target, exploit secretion abilities, or utilize natural tolerance to over-accumulated metabolites (Zhu et al., 2012). In this review we summarize the current state of the technology for the expression of codon optimized genes in microbial systems.

            "text": "At present, CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing has become the most widely used tool in various organisms. Numerous CRISPR-Cas9 tools and platforms have been developed, including the expanded nucleases and their variants, expression systems for multiplexing, precise genome editing with HDR or base editing, epigenome editing and transcriptome regulation (Liang et al., 2017;Lowder et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019;Mao et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2019). Most of studies focus on increasing the editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 system, especially the precise editing efficiency; expanding the genomic target ranges, achieving the sustained whole-genome editing; reducing off-target effect and improving specificity (Chen et al., 2019;Mao et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019). As mentioned before, improving the genome editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 is mainly from two aspects: improving CRISPR-Cas9 system activity and improving the accessibility of genomic target sites. \n\nIt is well known that protein expression level can be increased by enhancing the transcription and translation. Many previous studies are about how to increasing the expression level of Cas9 in cells. In this study we attempt to improve the genome editing efficiency of Cas9 from another perspective. The cleavage activity of Cas9 protein is closely related to its intracellular content, and the intracellular content of each protein is precisely regulated by cell. The balance of protein content is not only related to the expression level (input), but also to the degradation of the protein (output). It could be an effective strategy to increase the intracellular protein content by regulating the \"input\" and \"output\" of a protein at the same time. Most previous reports only focus on increasing Cas9 protein expression level (increasing input), but ignore the inhibition of Cas9 protein degradation (reducing output). Therefore, we consider to further enhance the stability of Cas9 protein and extend its half-life while maintaining high-level expression of Cas9 protein. This could increase the intracellular content of Cas9 protein, and improve the genome editing efficiency of Cas9 efficiently, stably and indiscriminately in the whole genome.",

Species from the Komagataeibacter genus produce high yields of pure cellulose materials in a short time with minimal resources, and pioneering work has shown that genetic engineering in these strains is possible and can be used to modify the material and its production. To accelerate synthetic biology progress in these bacteria, we introduce here the Komagataeibacter tool kit (KTK), a standardised modular cloning system based on Golden Gate DNA assembly that allows DNA parts to be combined to build complex multigene constructs expressed in bacteria from plasmids. Working in Komagataeibacter rhaeticus, we describe basic parts for this system, including promoters, fusion tags and reporter proteins, before showcasing how the assembly system enables more complex designs. Specifically, we use KTK cloning to reformat the Escherichia coli curli amyloid fibre system for functional expression in K. rhaeticus, and go on to modify it as a system for programming protein secretion from the cellulose producing bacteria. With this toolkit, we aim to accelerate modular synthetic biology in these bacteria, and enable more rapid progress in the emerging ELMs community.",

            "text": "exchanging their DNA parts. These could only be assembled serially by BioBrick cloning, and performance data on these parts was rarely reliable. Building a genetic construct was slow lab work and typically resulted in failure when added into a cell. Methods to fix a DNA construct once inside a cell were severely lacking and in high demand. It's no surprise therefore, that synthetic biology groups were the first to pounce on gene editing technologies like CRISPR as they appeared in 2011 and 2012. Since 2006, George Church's lab had been pursuing a project to mutate every TAG stop codon to TAA in E. coli to free up a codon for an extra amino acid 5 , and so unsurprisingly they were very interested in developing any technology that can precisely alter DNA inside a cell. His group and his former postdoc published the first two papers in 2013 showing CRISPR being used in eukaryotic cells and developed many further innovations of CRISPR in the following years, including CRISPR-based gene drives. Synthetic biology groups in California were also quick to turn CRISPR into more than just a cutting tool, inventing the now ubiquitous dCas9 as a programmable binder of DNA to enable customisable gene regulation 6 .\n\nWhile there's no doubt that CRISPR was the breakthrough of the decade in biosciences, it's perhaps its forerunner TALENs (TAL-Effector Nucleases) that deserve more credit in revolutionizing how synthetic biology changed in the past 10 years. The promise of modular, programmable binding of any DNA sequence and an in vivo gene editing method lured many towards this new technology in 2011. But the large highly-repetitive nature of TALENs was a slap in the face for anyone used to standard DNA cloning methods, PCR or even Gibson Assembly. If you wanted to work with TALENs you needed to either buy a lot of synthesised DNA, become an expert in robot-based DNA assembly automation, or get your hands on a Golden Gate  Assembly TALEN cloning toolkit from Addgene. Fortunately for synthetic biology, many people in the field tried one, two, or even all three of these things and soon began to see how much faster DNA assembly can proceed. Golden Gate DNA Assembly now rightly dominates the field and the many modular cloning (MoClo)",

            "text": "Synthetic biology builds artificial biological systems, and regulatory elements are the basis in this system, such as promoters, terminators, operators, open reading frame and ribosome-binding site (RBS). Gene expression is the basis for achieving gene function, especially for enzyme. The classic strategy to regulate this process is to construct an inducible expression system using the repressor protein and operon, such as IPTG system with lac operon in Escherichia coli. However, artificial systems constructed directly from natural elements often have the disadvantages of higher leakage expression, low induction efficiency, and poor stability for protein [109]. To overcome these bottlenecks, redesign artificial biological elements is highly desired [110]. We can develop high-performance biological elements, and standardize them to improve gene expression strength and stability, and achieve 'plug and play' goal. Samin et al. [94] reported that an engineered haloalkane dehalogenase with the constitutive dhlA promoter for improving 1,2, 3-trichloropropane degradation activity in Pseudomonas putida MC4. Gong et al. [96] improved keratinase expression via promoter engineering strategies for degradation of feather wastes. In addition, the AI-assistant designed promoters have already been experimentally demonstrated to be functional in Escherichia coli [95]. Synthetic terminator also performs the same function as natural terminator [98]. A native promoter of the bph operon was replaced by a constitutive promoter through homologous recombination, which greatly improved the biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyl degradation activity of Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102 [111]. Curran [97] et al. synthesized a panel of short terminators with stronger termination efficiency, which have been applied in modulating gene expression in yeast.",

            "text": "Since the advent of genetic engineering with the creation of the first recombinant DNA molecules in the 1970s (Jackson et al., 1972;Cohen et al., 1973), recombinant DNA technology has evolved to reach a new phase with the field of synthetic biology (Benner and Sismour, 2005). Although synthetic biology has its roots traced to a landmark publication in 1961 (Jacob and Monod, 1961), it significantly matured and scaled-up in the period from 2008 to 2013 (Cameron et al., 2014), in which novel and remarkable molecular cloning techniques could be used to generate complex gene constructs (Engler et al., 2008;Gibson et al., 2009;Engler et al., 2014), thus paving the way for wide-ranging applications through genome engineering tools. \n\nThese tools have been incorporated into plant biotechnology over the last decades, finally enabling the advent of New Breeding Techniques (NBTs) as the future of plant genetic manipulation (Ricroch et al., 2022). Hence, meganucleases (Chilton and Que, 2003), ZFNs (Zinc-finger nucleases) (Wright et al., 2005) and TALENs (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases) (Cermak et al., 2011;Mahfouz et al., 2011) had their use consecutively inaugurated in plants until the most recent generation of gene editor tools, based on CRISPR/Cas (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein) systems. CRISPR technology (Jinek et al., 2012) is the most sophisticated and practical genome editing approach and was firstly applied to the development of edited plants ten years ago (Feng et al., 2013;Shan et al., 2013). \n\nCRISPR/Cas systems remain the most modern editing tool to date, and it has been increasingly improved or adapted (Cardi et al., 2023), being boosted even by nanotechnology-based delivery systems (Demirer et al., 2021). CRISPR systems in biotechnology are derived from the natural adaptive 'immune system' of bacteria and archaea, based on RNA-guided endonucleases that bind and cleave foreign nucleic acids.",

            "text": "E. coli is one of the most widely used host organisms for microbial cell factories and synthetic biology applications [86,87,[106][107][108]. In the past, a large number of tools have been established to edit genomic sequences to knock-in or knock-out genes, which are primarily based on homologous recombination-based systems (e.g., \u03bb-Red, Cre-lox, and FLP-FRT). To expand the capacity of such systems to large-scale genomic editing that can efficiently modify multiple genomic loci, multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) and conjugative assembly genome engineering (CAGE) have been developed [109,110]. While these tools greatly improved our capability to edit E. coli genome, they often require the expression of selection markers in the genome or need either screening or genome sequencing to identify the desired clone. In addition, a number of tools to control endogenous gene expression levels without modifying the genome are also available in E. coli. For example, zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) and antisense RNAs can be designed to mostly turn down expression [111,112]. However, these tools often require the introduction of heterologous sequence to the genome and thus leave scars, or have limited design consensus [113]. \n\nAlthough tools in E. coli is relatively abundant compared to many other host organisms, CRISPR-Cas still greatly propels our capability to engineer E. coli. Such capabilities have largely facilitated metabolic engineering and proved to improve the titers, productivities and yields for various chemicals. Compared to the previously available tools, CRISPR-Cas-based systems have a few advantages that have been exploited in various applications. First, CRISPR-Cas system is highly efficient in cleaving the target sequence and thus can be combined with \u03bb-Red recombineering to achieve precise, efficient, and marker-free editing. For example, Jiang et al. developed a two-plasmid system that allowed iterative genome editing of multiple targets and curing of the plasmids after completion [114]. These systems saved the efforts to recycle selection markers and enable multiple modifications to be introduced simultaneously, thus greatly improved the engineering throughput.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology aims to create a biological engineering field based on principles such as modularity and abstraction. Until now, it has predominantly used a component-based metaphor inspired by electronic circuits: a genetic part encapsulates a specific sequence of DNA associated with a particular function, and parts are the basic building blocks of genetic circuits [1,2]. This paradigm has enabled the construction of many systems over the past decade. However, for advanced clinical and industrial applications to be realised, we must first be able to design and build systems that can function predictably across a wide range of varying internal and environmental conditions. To some extent, many of the challenges that faced synthetic biology a decade ago have been addressed through better part design, the development of orthogonal part libraries and improved techniques for screening [3,4]. Despite these advances, the development of synthetic biology into a truly predictive engineering discipline remains a challenge. \n\nThe context of a heterologous system is the environment in which it resides. This can include the compositional context (sequence and parts), the host context and the environmental context (in which the host exists) [5]. A range of context dependent effects has been demonstrated in prokaryotic systems. Within a promoter, operator sequences and their relative positions can significantly affect transcription rates [6]. While ribosome sequence can be used to predict binding strengths [7], the relative position of both cis and trans sequences can alter transcription and translation [8,9]. Connecting modular parts to form combined systems faces further challenges including retroactivity, which alters system dynamics [10,11]. Host context alters protein synthesis efficiency evidenced by the need for codon optimisation of coding sequences [12] and heterologous system functionality is affected directly, through competition for resources such as ribosomes [13][14][15][16][17] and proteases [18], and indirectly, through the growth rate [19][20][21]. The environmental context, including growth media [22], temperature [23][24][25] and pH [26] are well known examples of modifiers of circuit behaviour.",

Molecular tools and technologies for complex, multigene engineering in plants are as yet limited, with the challenge to enhance their stability and predictivity. Here, we present a new standardized and streamlined toolkit for plant synthetic biology, Mobius Assembly for Plant Systems (MAPS). It is based on small plant binary vectors pMAPs, which contain a fusion origin of replication that enhances plasmid yield in both Escherichia coli and Rhizobium radiobacter. MAPS includes a new library of promoters and terminators with different activity levels; part sizes were minimized to improve construct stability and transformation efficiency. These promoters and terminators were characterized using a high-throughput protoplast expression assay. We observed a significant influence of terminators on gene expression, as the strength of a single promoter can change more than seven-folds in combination with different terminators. Changing the coding sequence changed the relative strength of promoter and terminator pairs, thus uncovering combinatorial gene regulation among all parts of a transcriptional unit. We further gained insights into the mechanisms of such interactions by analyzing RNA folding, with which we suggest a design principle for more predictive and context-independent genetic parts in synthetic biology of plant systems and beyond.",

            "text": "Despite the foregoing successful proof-of-principle studies, wide application of cyanobacterial cell factories is still a technical challenge due to low yields of bioproducts [116]. One important limitation could be the relatively small number of sophisticated genetic regulatory components for achieving specific and tunable control of introduced genes and pathways in cyanobacteria [117]. Although a wide variety of well-established regulatory parts have been developed in other heterotrophic counterparts (e.g., E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), they may not always transferrable to cyanobacteria, leading to the delay in their advancement as industrial hosts [12,26]. Many recent attempts have been given to the characterization of standardized modular parts in cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, characterization of such parts could be significantly advanced by the establishment of robust and modular expression libraries [118]. In addition, the expansion of the genomic, expression and mutation libraries may also offer new insights into complex physiology of cyanobacteria, therefore facilitating metabolic engineering of model strains. On the other hand, CRISPR-based genome editing and interference approaches have proven to be potent and efficient tools in the regulation of gene expression by targeting multiple loci in parallel. However, the toxicity and off-target effects of the CRISPR nucleases still largely restricting its application in cyanobacteria genome modification [82]. Such an issue has been partially addressed by controlling the expression of CRISPR nucleases after introducing into cyanobacteria. Considering the current achievements in development of CRISPR-Cas systems in cyanobacteria, an invaluable toolkit can be anticipated for strain engineering in the future.",

            "text": "E. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a nascent interdisciplinary research field that leverages rational design approaches based on engineering principles. 1,2 Synthetic biology distinguishes itself from traditional genetic engineering in several ways: (1) synthetic biology takes advantage of de novo DNA synthesis technologies, rather than relying on the existing natural templates; (2) synthetic biologists use standardized genetic parts not only to facilitate the assembly of novel sequences, but also to more predictably construct the biological system based on the characterization of individual parts 3 ; and (3) similar to other engineering disciplines, computer-assisted designers (CADs) and mathematical modeling are instrumental in synthetic biology to effectively help synthetic biologists navigate the design space. 4 lthough synthetic biology is still in an early stage, several breakthroughs in the past decade have already demonstrated its great potential for society; for instance, Keasling's group used a synthetic biology approach to engineer the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce artemisinin, an important antimalarial drug. 5 Lu and Collins engineered bacteriophage for an antibiotic therapy 6 and, more recently, also developed a paper-based cell-free methodology to rapidly detect Ebola viruses. 7 he enabling technology for synthetic biology is the development of a suite of advanced DNA synthesis and assembly methods, such as Golden Gate assembly, 8 Gibson assembly, 9 circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC), 10 transformation-assisted recombination (TAR) cloning, 11 and PaperClip assembly 12 (for a comprehensive review on DNA assembly methods, refer to Ellis et al. 13 ). Collectively, these technologies open up the possibility to redesign and resynthesize DNA at the genome scale. Poliovirus cDNA was synthesized without a natural template in 2002 by Cello et al. 14 Itaya's group pioneered the combination of two genomes in one cell in vivo. 15 The J. Craig Venter Institute chemically resynthesized a bacterial genome 16 and developed the genome transplantation technology to reboot the cell with the synthetic bacterial genome. 17 Together with several other groups across the world, our group is part of the international synthetic yeast consortium (www.syntheti cyeast.org), which aims to redesign and resynthesize the world's first eukaryotic genome.",

            "text": "Global agriculture faces a daunting challenge posed by climate change. Rising temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and extreme climatic events increasingly threaten crop yields, necessitating the development of more robust agricultural varieties. 1,2 In this context, plant synthetic biology emerges as a potential solution, offering innovative strategies to enhance the resilience and adaptability of crops to changing environmental conditions. 3,4 Yet, the current pace of crop engineering is slow mainly because plant growth is inherently slow and genetic engineering in plants is difficult. Discovery, development, and approval of novel crop traits currently take about 10\u221215 years, with about 4 years spent developing proof-of-concepts and optimizing genetic constructs. 5 \u22129 These features make chloroplasts an attractive target for introducing novel traits into plants. 10,11 espite the recognized potential, chloroplast biotechnology remains challenging. While transplastomic plants have been successfully generated in some species, tools available for chloroplast engineering are still limited. 12 The foundation of synthetic biology is rooted in the application of engineering principles to biological systems, with standardization being a critical aspect. 13 Standardization is particularly vital for the development and dissemination of easily shareable biological parts. 14 The availability of a diverse array of genetic parts for the controlled expression of transgenes is especially essential in plastids. This need arises from the potential risks associated with the repeated use of identical genetic elements in the chloroplast genome, which could lead to unintended homologous recombination, even with sequence stretches as short as 50 base pairs. 15 Moreover, synthetic genetic circuits often require the precise calibration of their constituent parts' activities to function reliably. 16,17 To enable synthetic biology applications in plastids to the level of versatility and complexity already achieved in bacteria would require the availability of wellcharacterized gene expression elements with a broad range of activities. \n\nHowever, genetic part characterization in plastids is more challenging than that in microbes due to the longer time scales needed for generating transplastomic organisms. Extensive and efficient genetic tools enable rapid engineering within days in microbial chassis.",

            "text": "A primary objective of synthetic biology is the construction of genetic circuits with behaviors that can be predicted based on the properties of the constituent genetic parts from which they are built. However a significant issue in the construction of synthetic genetic circuits is a phenomenon known as context dependence in which the behavior of a given part changes depending on the choice of adjacent or nearby parts. Interactions between parts compromise the modularity of the circuit, impeding the implementation of predictable genetic constructs. To address this issue, investigators have devised genetic insulators that prevent these unintended context-dependent interactions between neighboring parts. One of the most commonly used insulators in bacterial systems is the self-cleaving ribozyme RiboJ. Despite its utility as an insulator, there has been no systematic quantitative assessment of the effect of RiboJ on the expression level of downstream genetic parts. Here, we characterized the impact of insulation with RiboJ on expression of a reporter gene driven by a promoter from a library of 24 frequently employed constitutive promoters in an Escherichia coli model system. We show that, depending on the strength of the promoter, insulation with RiboJ increased protein abundance between twofold and tenfold and increased transcript abundance by an average of twofold. This result demonstrates that genetic insulators in E. coli can impact the expression of downstream genes, information that is essential for the design of predictable genetic circuits and constructs.",

            "text": "Efficient genome editing is a prerequisite of genetic engineering in synthetic biology, which has been recently achieved by the powerful CRISPR/Cas9 system. However, the toxicity of Cas9, due to its abundant intracellular expression, has impeded its extensive applications. Here we constructed a genetic cassette with triple controls of Cas9 activities at transcriptional, translational and protein levels, together with over-expression of the ATP synthase \u03b2-subunit AtpD, for the efficient genome editing in Streptomyces. By deletion of actII-ORF4 in Streptomyces coelicolor as a model, we found that constitutive expression of cas9 had about 90% editing efficiency but dramatically reduced transformation efficiency by 900-fold. However, triple controls of Cas9 under non-induction conditions to reduce its activity increased transformation efficiency over 250-fold, and had about 10% editing efficiency if combined with atpD overexpression. Overall, our strategy accounts for about 30-fold increased possibility for successful genome editing under the non-induction condition. In addition, about 80% editing efficiency was observed at the actII-ORF4 locus after simultaneous induction with thiostrepton, theophylline and blue light for Cas9 activity reconstitution. This improved straightforward efficient genome editing was also confirmed in another locus redD. Thus, we developed a new strategy for efficient genome editing, and it could be readily and widely adaptable to other Streptomyces species to improve genetic manipulation for rapid strain engineering in Streptomyces synthetic biology, due to the highly conserved genetic cassettes in this genus.",

We consider wetware as DNA parts, and their composed DNA devices are used to produce biological systems that meet user-defined abstract descriptions (Figure 1). Researchers have leveraged synthetic biology tools and methods [36] to develop novel DNA parts and devices to expand the possibilities of biological applications. Synthetic biology methods generally consider DNA parts as reusable building blocks of larger devices in assembly methods (see, e.g., the review [81]). In addition, researchers have made significant advances in other related fields, such as protein engineering (see, e.g., the review articles [82,83]) and metabolic engineering (see, e.g., [84,85]. In this article, due to the specific paradigm shift, we aim to demonstrate the most likely and achievable \"wetware\" to be predictably designed; thus, this section focuses on advances and challenges in designing, building, and testing DNA constructs from characterized DNA parts. \n\nSo, like electrical engineering principles, multiple sequence candidates must be studied and characterized with certain predictability and success rates before being used reliably and rationally in a genetic engineering process.

For example, artificial environments, synthetic metabolic pathways [48], and synthetic communities can be developed and screened in search of specific metabolites, growth relations, or intercellular interactions. Individual droplet microfluidic components have been developed to enable a wide range of functionalities, such as droplet generation [49], droplet sorting [50], droplet merging [51], droplet picoinjection [52], and droplet sensing [53] (Figure 4(a)). For example, by encapsulating standard biological chassis within monodisperse picoliter-scale emulsions, droplet microfluidic can grow, measure, and manipulate biological systems at the single-cell level with unprecedented throughput [54].",

            "text": "The term \"synthetic biology\" has existed since before the early 1980s, referring to genetically engineered bacteria designed to perform a specific task (Benner & Sismour 2005). Since then, the term has acquired a variety of aspects and taken on several different, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, definitions. At the turn of the new century, the term \"synthetic biology\" was used to describe novel (read: \"unnatural\") organic molecules functioning in living cells (Rawls 2000). Indeed, these days, the term encompasses both of the aforementioned endeavors, and many additional types of study, including metabolic modelling, specific recombinant DNA assembly processes, and development of cells with stripped-down genomes. In short, the emerging discipline of synthetic biology is built on a multidisciplinary foundation and encompasses a wide range of subdisciplines. \n\nSynthetic biology can generally be thought of as engineering biology. To wit, synthetic biology even has its own multi-step, cyclic design process (the Design-Build-Test (DBT) cycle) similar to the engineering design process (Baldwin et al. 2016; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2018). Semi-automated, iterative metabolic engineering is even possible by implementing machine learning methods that are able to recommend new strain designs for the next DBT cycle (van Lent et al. 2023). In most classical engineering disciplines, problems are solved, and products are made with the aid of standardized parts. The concept of standardization is a relatively new one in biology. Standards can improve the synthetic biology design process by providing better communication between workers and groups, interchangeability, reproducibility, quality assurance, safety, etc. (M\u00fcller & Arndt 2012). Standardization comes in part from published documents called standards, and these documents are published by a variety of professional societies and other entities. Consumer products can be repeatably and reliably manufactured thanks to the existence of standardized parts (e.g., bolt and screw threads). The biosciences have had standards in the form of synthetic growth media formulations, chemical compositions, and other aspects of manufacturing products for biological research (Benner & Sismour 2005). However, only recently have there existed standardized DNA parts for molecular biology and construction of novel strains and cell lines in bioengineering.",

            "text": "Efficient genome editing is a prerequisite of genetic engineering in synthetic biology, which has been recently achieved by the powerful CRISPR/Cas9 system. However, the toxicity of Cas9, due to its abundant intracellular expression, has impeded its extensive applications. Here we constructed a genetic cassette with triple controls of Cas9 activities at transcriptional, translational and protein levels, together with overexpression of the ATP synthase \u03b2-subunit AtpD, for the efficient genome editing in Streptomyces. By deletion of actII-ORF4 in Streptomyces coelicolor as a model, we found that constitutive expression of cas9 had about 90% editing efficiency but dramatically reduced transformation efficiency by 900-fold. However, triple controls of Cas9 under non-induction conditions to reduce its activity increased transformation efficiency over 250-fold, and had about 10% editing efficiency if combined with atpD overexpression. Overall, our strategy accounts for about 30-fold increased possibility for successful genome editing under the non-induction condition. In addition, about 80% editing efficiency was observed at the actII-ORF4 locus after simultaneous induction with thiostrepton, theophylline and blue light for Cas9 activity reconstitution. This improved straightforward efficient genome editing was also confirmed in another locus redD. Thus, we developed a new strategy for efficient genome editing, and it could be readily and widely adaptable to other Streptomyces species to improve genetic manipulation for rapid strain engineering in Streptomyces synthetic biology, due to the highly conserved genetic cassettes in this genus.",

The development of CRISPR and related tools has opened a window into previously unsolvable issues in our understanding of genetics, the noncoding genome and heterogeneity, and provided new insights into therapeutic vulnerabilities for variable diseases. The field of genome editing of various organisms has advanced quickly over the last two decades (Figure 1), and as a result, it has drawn a lot of attention from researchers who have reviewed the most recent developments in-depth and offered their predictions for the field's future developments. While CRISPR-Cas technologies were developing greatly and very quickly in insects in vivo and cultured cells in vitro, it also helped to develop other genetic editing and protein expression systems such as the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). In this review, we discuss baculoviral delivery systems and how current vector systems can be developed through CRISPR gene editing and genome engineering applications. \n\nFigure 1.

The yeast S. cerevisiae is an election chassis for these purposes, as demonstrated by several examples of heterologous production processes of complex molecules carried out in this final host, some of which have achieved the industrial production scale. 1,2 One of the advantages of using S. cerevisiae as chassis is that its genetic manipulation is greatly facilitated by many synthetic biology tools. 3 To reduce the readiness-to-market of metabolites deriving from long pathways and resulting in complex structures, there is a need to further expand and merge various synthetic biology approaches, to facilitate the applicability of the design\u2212build\u2212test\u2212learn cycle and to further ameliorate the predictability of microorganisms' engineering.\n\nTwo key principles of synthetic biology are modularity and reusability of built parts, which has to be designed to be used easily and flexibly. Therefore, the parts, DNA fragments with different purposes and origins (promoters, terminators, coding sequences, etc.), can then be assembled in complex devices, like expression cassettes, which, in turn, can then be used to engineer the final host. The possibility of assembling parts and building devices is offered by the variety of assembly methods, which allows joining many different DNA sequences in the desired order in a one-pot reaction with high efficiencies. 4 Moreover, technological breakthroughs have made genome editing significantly easier, mainly thanks to the development of the CRISPR-Cas9 platform, which provides a powerful tool for sequence-specific genome editing, including gene knockout, gene knock-in, and site-specific sequence mutagenesis and corrections. 5 It is important to notice that each system brings elements of novelty and ameliorations, and at the same time, its application indicates limitations and suggests further improvements.\n\nLee and colleagues 6 recently developed a library of Golden Gate-assembled parts leading to plasmids, which then can be integrated into the S. cerevisiae genome. To do this, the authors made use of the CRISPR-Cas9 approach, exploiting the selectable markers included in the final plasmids to screen positive clones. The use",

Since the generation of the first recombinant molecule by Jackson and colleagues [2], giant steps towards the comprehension of living organism's fundamental processes have been made and the birth of biotechnology was made possible [3]. The more diverse and complex the plasmids are, the more applications and broader hosts we can genetically engineer. To expand our knowledge regarding gene function in specific organisms, plasmids are the most important tool for gene silencing experiments, protein overexpression and more recently, the generation of genome editing tools, rendering plasmids as the prime choice for modern biology research [3,4]. Still, the biology of these diverse molecules remains surprising for researchers due to their ecological role and the evolutionary pressure for the host [5]. \n\nWe have acquired reasonably enough information to understand the works behind plasmid biology and their usefulness, perhaps the strongest tool for novel plasmid development can be found in synthetic biology, powered by specific software and the ever-reducing costs in DNA sequencing and synthesis [4]. Even with all the advances thus far reported in the literature, there are some aspects of cloning plasmids that can be improved. For instance, the selection of positive clones. \n\nAround the world, many labs still relay on plasmids bearing a selective marker for successful clone selection, such as blue/white screening, inactivation of toxic genes, GFP or fluorescent protein expressing vectors wherein upon cloning the fluorescence is absent, other reporter genes such as phosphatases or biosynthetic genes that produces color when uninterrupted by a cloning fragment [1,6]. These systems are restricted depending on the bacterial host where molecular cloning is desired due to a limitation in codon usage and regulatory elements that drive reporter expression.",

[318] have developed a modular synthetic biology toolkit to engineer P. chrysogenum for the optimized production of enzymes or metabolites of interest. The authors present 96 genetic elements such as natural and synthetic promoters, terminators, fluorescent reporters, selection markers, and regulatory and DNA-binding domains of transcriptional regulators. In addition, there are components for the implementation of different CRISPR-based technologies. The purpose is to have available many different genetic parts that can be assembled into complex multipartite constructs to be integrated in the genome or expressed from an AMA1-based autonomously replicating vector. New synthetic transcription units, which may include synthetic transcriptional regulation devices, encoding natural or fusion proteins, can be more rapidly assembled in a standardized and modular manner to obtain novel fungal cell factories.\n\nIn summary, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, in combination with other techniques, will allow engineering P. chrysogenum in ways that have not yet been fully explored, which include, but are not limited to, the replacement of natural gene promoters in BGCs by engineered strong and adjustable promoters to improve production yields of endogenous or exogenous compounds [323], the engineering of modular enzymes such as PKS and NRPS by module swapping to obtain modified secondary metabolites (discussed in [235] and [359]), and the combination of biosynthetic genes from different organisms to produce structurally diverse \"unnatural products\" [360].",

Bottom-up approaches have been recently investigated to mimic the traditional design processes in engineering areas. In this context, research studies have been carried out to evaluate the predictability boundaries of biological systems composed by precharacterized parts, providing the expected interconnection error, estimated from the study of model systems, and highlighting situations where circuits cannot behave (i) What is still needed to fully understand the context-dependent variability of biological parts? (ii) How can we develop accurate computational tools for the bottom-up biological engineering? (iii) How can we support the construction of novel synthetic biology-based solutions? (iv) How can we understand, model and predict cell-to-cell variability in the functioning of biological systems? (v) If the fully predictable engineering of biological systems is not possible, how can we improve the efficiency of trial-and-error approaches? \n\nBox 2: Outstanding questions. \n\nas intended. Mathematical models support the bottom-up design steps, from the early feasibility study of complex functions to the quantitative prediction of circuit behaviour from the knowledge of basic parts function and, finally, to the debugging step. \n\nTo exploit the full potential of synthetic biology via an engineering-inspired bottom-up design of circuits, several challenges need to be faced. The main crucial issues identified in the context of this work are delineated in Box 2 in the form of outstanding questions and they are herein discussed. \n\nPredictable biological engineering requires deepening our knowledge on context dependency and reusability of biological parts, by discovering the features that play important roles in parts function predictability. Technology advances in the DNA synthesis field can support the testing of large number of hypotheses by providing huge libraries of constructs at affordable price. In fact, although large-scale studies have been reported to support the investigation of different aspects of parts predictability [60,81,96], the cost and scale of DNA synthesis are still a major bottleneck for basic research, since many studies require a very large number of construct variants, as in the case of codon usage dependency in protein expression [88]. The development of high-throughput methods for parts measurement plays a complementary role, because multifaceted characterization of parts performance needs to be carried out.",

The availability of genome modification techniques by recombination in Grampositive, Gram-negative, and eukaryotic unicellular organisms has created a favorable research environment for comparative analysis. \n\nProgress in genome analysis led to the development of research resources in yeast, the creation of databases, the construction of gene clone and deletion strain libraries, and their sharing as community assets [153,154]. For example, participating institutions in Europe and Japan worked together as a community to build a B. subtilis deletion strain library [155,156]. \n\nAlthough a similar comprehensive experimental resource community has been proposed for E. coli, few laboratories agreed to participate. Groups at Keio University, the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, and Purdue University therefore agreed to develop this resource. Although the time to completion was undetermined, the development of many innovations resulted in the completion of the entire project in 3 years. These developed resources were subsequently shared with the research community as open resources. E. coli could therefore be positioned as a model microorganism alongside B. subtilis and yeast. \n\nThe importance of putting all the pieces together is enormous. The importance of analyzing the structure and function of target genes and proteins in detail through individually targeted analyses will likely remain unchanged. However, looking at the entire picture revealed aspects that could not be determined from individual studies of a narrow range of targets. Molecular biology in the 20th century has been described as a very precise \"science of parts\", whereas genome research, starting in the 1990s and extending into the 21st century, can be described as \"science as a system\". Alignment of the two will likely greatly advance our understanding of the whole picture of life.",

Recently, a library of synthetic transcriptional regulator systems, which include synthetic activators, synthetic repressors, and synthetic promoters, was established to control plant gene expression in a tissue-specific and environmentally responsive manner [99]. Genome recoding (i.e., rewriting codon meaning through chemical synthesis for new features) has been practiced in microbial systems [100] and could be used to generate novel biological parts for plant biosystems design.\n\nTo facilitate international access and reproducibility of data, a centralized knowledgebase of validated biological parts needs to be established, which includes specific experimental context, standardization, and crossed references among different databases (e.g., iGEM, SynBioHub, and Addgene) [85]. The nomenclature of such a knowledgebase would build upon structures already defined by the parts repositories listed above and expand the concept from genomic constructs such as promoters and coding sequences into plant specific structures. Such an initiative could be established through collaboration with KBase [101], with the capability of submission, query, functional mapping onto the gene-metabolite network, as illustrated in Figure 6. There are several challenges to realize the standardization of biolog-ical parts across the international plant biodesign research community. For example, (1) how can data be standardized and made comparable between different laboratories? And (2) how can part characterization be rewarded? These challenges may be addressed through international workshops sponsored by a professional society, with participants from academia and industries in the future. For registration of biological parts, it would be important to include negative results, which typically do not get published or reported, to avoid wasteful repetitions in different labs. The negative results would also be very helpful for computational design of synthetic biological parts using machine learning approaches.\n\n3.4. Genetic Construct Design. Genetic constructs are designed for nucleic acid sequence modification, gene expression regulation, and metabolic engineering. The genetic design for genomic sequence modification in vivo can be achieved through different methods, including CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing, with an emphasis on maximizing on-target efficiency and minimizing offtarget effects [102].

Expression systems that are well characterized and have many genetic tools, such as expression vectors and strong promoters optimized for use in that specific system, will have an advantage. Producing a transgenic E. coli is much easier (Verma et al., 1998) than producing a transgenic goat because of the complexity of the goat's genome and because genetic manipulation is well understood in E. coli. CHO cells, S. cerevisiae, and E. coli are the best understood and therefore the most used expression systems. Using a well-characterized system reduces development time and increases the predictability of the production process. Even CHO cells, a well characterized mammalian cell type, rely on essentially random integration of expression cassettes (Barnes, Bentley, & Dickson, 2003;Manivasakam, Aubrecht, Sidhom, & Schiestl, 2001), and in these less controlled genetic engineering approaches detailed screening is the key to creating productive strains. Another consideration is the genetic stability of an expression system (Barnes et al., 2003), which determines how long the system will continue to produce the target protein at the original level and specificity. Plant expression systems are relatively easy to manipulate genetically, and transgenes are generally more stable than in bacterial systems.",

It is a multidisciplinary science in a true sense as it derives knowledge from various disciplines (such as genetics, nanotechnology, chemical engineering, robotics, systems biology and computational biology), in order to manipulate living cells to obtain desired functions. \n\nOver the past decade, synthetic biology has emerged as an engineering discipline for biological systems. Compared with other substrates, biology possess a unique set of engineering challenges resulting from an incomplete understanding of natural biological systems and tools for manipulating them. It is speculated that with further technological advancements and understanding of the biological phenomenon, greater avenues for synthetic biology applications will emerge which would allow incorporation of the information generated through various projects based on genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics [6]. \n\nSynthetic biology aims at enablement of creation of living organisms with user defined genetic circuitry and novel characteristics by modulating, regulating and redesigning the gene expression profile of the host organism, enabling its exploitation for various applications [7]. As a stepping stone towards this direction, micro-organisms (such as Escherichia coli) with minimal genome have been created [8]. Such microbes can be further transformed with genes conferring them novel functions. \n\nOn the other hand, microbiology, the multidisciplinary science of microorganisms, has a significant impact on the world. With its roots in the 19th century, it matured into a scientific discipline concerned with the structure, function, and classification of these organisms and with ways of controlling and using their activities. It continued to evolve into the major subdivisions of microbiology, which include medical, industrial, agricultural, food and dairy. Microbiology is used to treat major pandemics and frequent infections. It also has an impact on the food people consume [9], and it has been shown that the recently identified natural antitumor compounds from various natural origins including fungi and endophytic fungi [10].",

The first challenge is that it is difficult for cyanobacteria to reach the theoretical yield due to the deficiency of genetic manipulation tools, and novel promoters or ribosome binding sites for precise gene expression control should be further investigated. The next challenge is that although the genome editing of cyanobacteria is simple, the cycle is relatively slow. The traditional homologous recombination-mediated approach should integrate heterologous expression modules into chromosomes or endogenous plasmids but has the challenge of being time-consuming, and the use of a broad-host-range vector faces the problem of compatibility. 106 Further, developing stable shuttle expression vectors in cyanobacteria will accelerate the construction of recombinant cyanobacteria. 107 oreover, the industrial application of cyanobacteriamediated light-driven biotransformation is limited due to scale-up difficulties, and the illumination efficiency and light availability were the main limiting factors. 108 Consequently, novel photobioreactors should be developed to allow a short light path between the light source and the medium. Taken together, the development of stable shuttle expression vectors and novel photobioreactors would provide us with better research capabilities in cyanobacteria-mediated light-driven biotransformation.",

            "text": "The field of synthetic biology is built upon the ability to manipulate DNA sequences rapidly and reliably. The availability of genetic toolkits to predictably manipulate protein expression levels has allowed biology to become increasingly engineered. Establishing genetic circuitry relies on the correct assembly of functional genetic regions including promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBS), coding DNA sequences (CDS), and terminators, allowing the construction of custom DNA sequences with designed functionalities. \n\nEffective DNA assembly methods are essential tools for any synthetic biologist. These assembly techniques include traditional restriction enzyme cloning, such as blunt-end or stickyend cloning, and seamless cloning methods such as Gibson assembly. 1 Although cloning using restriction enzymes has been common practice for decades, this technique was modernized with the conception of BioBricks. 2 This method relied on the use of a set of standardized restriction sites to enable the modular assembly of characterized DNA fragments. The standardized assembly methods, modular parts repositories, and most importantly its widespread adoption by the synthetic biology community represented a leap forward in the field. However, BioBricks suffered from the same technical limitations as traditional restriction enzyme cloning, most notably low efficiencies with complex assemblies. \n\nIn 2008, a new DNA assembly method coined Golden Gate Assembly (GGA) was introduced, which was based on Type IIS restriction enzymes displaying restriction activity distal from their own recognition site. 3 \u22125 Indeed, correct assemblies with up to 52 parts covering 40 kb have been reported using GGA. 6 In addition, GGA allows the use of both circular-and linear DNA as parts simultaneously, expanding the method's flexibility. The most commonly used Type IIS enzymes (BsaI, BbsI, BsmBI/ Bpil) leave 4 bp sticky overhangs, but a GGA kit using SapI leaving 3 bp overhangs has also been developed. 7 \u221220 For E. coli, the CIDAR MoClo kit was the first modular Golden Gate DNA parts library made publicly available via Addgene (Kit #1000000059) and it has been widely used since. 17 This kit contained a series of promoters and RBSs from the Anderson collection, as well as several inducible promoter parts, their repressors, and CDS parts coding for fluorescent proteins.",

            "text": "Introduction: synthetic biology, synthetic genomics and synthetic yeast Synthetic biologists aim to engineer and control living cells, but their attempts are often thwarted by the humility-inducing complexity of the biological substrate, which tends to mutate, evolve and respond to its context (Weiss 2009). This confrontation between the audacity of engineering and the \"hopeful contingencies of biology\" (Davies 2011, 439) is a rich site for research in science and technology studies (STS).\n\nSynthetic biology is a heterogeneous collection of approaches to designing and building with DNA (O'Malley et al. 2008), but most social scientific and philosophical work on the topic has explored the \"parts-based\" approach, which has been synthetic biology's posterchild since the early 2000s (Frow 2013). It is dominated by the aspiration to \"make biology easy to engineer\" (Endy 2008, 340) by constructing modular, standardized genetic parts and circuits that are inserted into recipient cells, where (in theory) they perform the synthetic biologist's specified function (O'Malley et al. 2008). The success of this approach is assessed in terms of how well the inserted parts and circuits produce the desired product or behavior. Recently, however, a branch of synthetic biology that aims to synthesize the complete genomes of existing organisms has been gaining ground. This could be thought of as a natural progression. As Palsson (2000) forecast nearly two decades ago: \"We will move from talking about genetic engineering of single genes, to what may become known as 'genome engineering', where the whole organism is the context of the design\" (1149). When \"the whole organism is the context of the design\" the focus shifts from the expression of an inserted genetic construct to the phenotype of the organismits observable characteristics.\n\nAlthough gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 are currently generating much excitement, we argue that more sociological and philosophical attention needs to be given to construction at the whole genome scale, particularly because we see these genome \"writing\" projects (as they are called) rapidly increasingly in number (Chari and Church 2017) the most contentious of which sets out to synthesize the human genome. 1 Unlike the sequencing of whole genomeswhich involves determining the order of nucleic acidssynthesis provides",

However, a wide variety of engineering strategies can be used with the conventional recombinant DNA technologies, including genome editing, ribosome engineering, precursor engineering, mutagenesis, and overexpression of structural genes, making it possible to facilitate the efficient production of natural products and pharmaceuticals in microbial systems. \n\nCurrent technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated protein), should also be considered as tools for genome editing for additional improvements and to increase production (Gaj et al., 2013). For example, in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 cloning with Gibson assembly has provided an alternate strategy for heterologous expression of cryptic BGCs from genetically recalcitrant actinomycetes strains (Wang J.W. et al., 2015;Jiang and Zhu, 2016). Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 has many prospects in the analyses of biochemical pathways in Streptomyces strains due to the development of a pCRISPomyces expression system (Cobb et al., 2015). With genome editing tools, it is also possible that nonmodel native hosts can be engineered to be heterologous production hosts to become platforms for combinatorial biosynthesis to create synthetic natural products and natural product derivatives. Some intrinsic limitations for nonmodel microbial hosts can be also improved by this genetic modification. Corynebacterium glutamicum, a GRAS organism, has been used for the industrial production of various amino acids for over five decades (Becker et al., 2011). Recently, it also showed promising potential for use as a protein expression system (Kallscheuer et al., 2016). However, this bacterium has intrinsic disadvantages, including a much lower transformation efficiency and lower yields of protein production.",

            "text": "For production of fuels and chemicals, two competing design models exist. One design paradigm aims to endow some heterologous trait (e.g., a biomass utilization or production phenotype) onto a highly editable platform organism (e.g., E. coli) with the rationale that strain engineering can be performed more quickly and in a high-throughput manner. High throughput methodologies can enable rapid construction of balanced pathways (Smanski et al., 2014), synthetically designed genetic parts (Jones et al., 2015;Rohlhill et al., 2017), and whole-genome recoding (Ostrov et al., 2016). However, importing heterologous pathways often requires significant effort to achieve the production titers attained by native producing strains. The alternative approach is to improve strains which innately have the desired trait. Such strains already contain and use necessary genes and pathways, including cofactor regeneration. Engineering strains which already have a desired phenotype can avoid potential challenges such as the metabolic burden of high expression of heterologous genes, cofactor imbalance, genetic instability of imported genes or pathways, among others (Wu et al., 2016;Czajka et al., 2017;Wang M. et al., 2017). Development of an advanced genome engineering \"tool kit\" in non-platform organisms brings these two models closer together. \n\nAdvancements in the synthetic biology tool kit are required to better utilize the biotechnologically important capabilities of the Clostridium genus.

            "text": "Synthetic biology is a field that focuses on using well-defined genetic parts to build new synthetic systems. One of the goals is to have the capacity to design and build synthetic cells with predictable functions and applications, including the production of biocommodities, therapeutic treatment and biosensors [88,89]. Indeed, recent reviews of synthetic biology have highlighted artificial cells as promising synthetic systems [88,89]. The field approaches biological engineering from several unique angles. First, synthetic biology highlights design principles that can guide the control of biological systems [90,91]. Rational design is a mainstay of synthetic biology that relies on the idea that biological systems are fundamentally modular [54,92]. During the design process, genes are defined as the basic biological units. The aim of rational design is to generate an optimized outcome through logical assembly of these basic units. For example, the synthesis of the precursor of the anti-malaria drug, artemisinic acid was achieved by coupling an engineered mevalonate pathway with two enzymes (amorphadiene synthase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) in yeast [93]. \n\nSecond, synthetic biologists use well-characterized and interoperable modules, such as promoters, operators, transcriptional factors and ribosome binding sites, as building blocks to create higher-order circuits [53,[94][95][96][97]. For example, a promoter library was used to ascertain rules that describe the responsiveness of a promoter to transcriptional factors [98]. Specifically, promoters were sub-divided into the core, proximal and distal regions. For prokaryotes, the strength of transcriptional repression was shown to be the greatest when a repressor site was located in the core region of a promoter. The repression strength was less strong when located in the proximal region and was the weakest when located in the distal region. Conversely, activators worked only in the distal region and had no effect in the core and proximal regions [99]. These basic principles could be exploited to assemble promoter modules in a bottom-up approach. \n\nThird, synthetic biology uses a bottom-up approach to understand biological circuits.",

            "text": "In this work, we describe a modular synthetic biology toolkit for use in filamentous fungi. Most of the genetic parts in this toolkit originate from Aspergillus or Penicillium species or from other established synthetic fungal systems for gene regulation, heterologous expression, and genetic engineering. [5][6][7]27,28 It is a common observation that promoters and other genomic elements of filamentous fungi are interchangeable among fungal species and are therefore widely used in heterologous filamentous fungal systems. 6,12 The parts of this MoClo toolkit were analyzed in P. rubens unless the genetic part was already established or characterized in previous studies as listed in Table 1. All of the vectors were constructed using the standardized MoClo system, which was discussed in detail by Weber et al.. 19 This collection of basic genetic parts provides a tool for rapid assembly of various combinations of parts into multigene genetic circuits, which can be delivered to the host organism through genomic integration or using episomal AMA1 vectors.\n\nA collection of functional native or synthetic promoters and terminators are essential for a synthetic biology toolkit. The Fungal Modular Cloning Toolkit provides 20 promoters, three core promoters, and 11 terminators (Table 1). These genomic elements were previously used in synthetic genetic circuits in Aspergillus or Penicillium with varying strain background, media, and cultivation methods ( Table 1). 5\u22127,28 Others were benchmarked previously in P. rubens using fluorescent reporters in a BioLector microbioreactor. 27 Constitutive Promoters. Constitutive promoters deliver stable expression across different growth environments and growth phases. Strong constitutive promoters like the commonly used promoter of gpdA (ANIA_08041) 29 from the glycolytic pathway are often used to drive gene expression in Aspergillus or Penicillium. The gpdA promoter is used to constitutively express various genes as well as fungal selection markers, ribozyme self-cleaved sgRNA, or expression of STFs. 5,18 The promoter of the TEF1 (translation-elongation factor 1a) gene is another common strong and constitutive fungal promoter that has been",

            "text": "Synthetic biology combines genetic engineering, molecular biology, systems biology, biophysics, electrical engineering and evolutionary biology. Synthetic biology applies these disciplines to build biological systems for research, engineering, regenerative medicine, design and industrial applications. Synthetic biology is defined as \"an emerging discipline that uses engineering principles to design and assemble biological components\" (Wellhausen & Oye, 2007), or biological modules, biological systems, and biological machines for useful purposes\". (Nakano, 2013;Hayden, 2014;Robertson, et al., 2015). The goal of synthetic biology is to extend or modify the behavior of organisms to perform new tasks. However, SB is still a developing discipline that undergo extensive investigations about its drawbacks, for example; the inability to fully predict the functions of even simple devices in engineered cells and construct systems that perform multifaceted tasks with precision and reliability, due to several sources of uncertainty, some of which show the incompleteness of the available information about inherent cellular characteristics; such as the effects of gene expression noise, mutation, cell death, undefined and changing extracellular environments, and interactions with cellular context.The process of genetic engineering offers a broader definition of SB, associated with the practices of copying DNA sequences from the genome of an organism and, through recombinant DNA, importing the sequence from one organism to another, so that the host organism exhibits some characteristic of the donor (Robertson, et al., 2015). Recently it became possible to map entire genomes for individual organisms, which make it possible to make associations between specific DNA expression and the characteristics and behaviors of individual organisms. While DNA is described as the blueprint of life, the relationship between DNA sequences, the expression of proteins and the characteristics of biological systems are significantly more complex than this analogy suggests. While there are instances of isolated gene sequences resulting in clearly defined characteristics in an organism, much of what is understood in terms of the morphology and behavior of biological systems is derived from groups of different genes being expressed through the more complex proteome which is the entire population of proteins produced by a cell or organism, at particular growth stages or in particular environments. (Robertson, et al., 2015). A highly prominent approach to SB is to abstract biological systems through design of more traditional forms of engineering.",

            "text": "Engineering biological systems with predictable, quantitative behavior is currently a challenging problem. Presently, this requires months (at times years) of trial-anderror type of experiments, with the engineering of functional systems being more akin to art than engineering [1]. Synthetic biology aims to develop foundational principles and technologies that will enable the systematic forward engineering of biological systems [2][3][4]. In particular, synthetic biology aims to develop frameworks that apply the engineering principles of abstraction, modularity, and composition to biological engineering. Basic abstraction and physical composition frameworks have been applied to the engineering of biology through the use of BioBricks and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts [5][6][7]. A characteristic feature of other established engineering disciplines is the ability to design and construct systems by way of modularity. The concept of modularity allows engineers to design and build physical systems by bringing together modules that contribute independently to the whole, thereby giving rise to a system whose quantitative behavior can be predicted from its constituent modules [8][9][10]. A pressing research question is whether the complexity of living organisms * Correspondence: keasling@berkeley.edu 2 Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article allows engineers to design and construct biological systems from smaller elements characterized in isolation [11,12]. The success of synthetic biology as an engineering discipline will depend, in part, on establishing the conditions necessary for this independence property to hold true in living systems [13]. The research contribution of this study is the application of engineering principles towards realizing modularity and functional composition in biological systems. More specifically, we show that genetic devices (each consisting of a promoter, ribosome binding site, gene of interest, and transcription terminator) can behave in a standardized, quantitatively predictable manner. The ability to view devices as modules may be of benefit in such applications as metabolic pathway construction for the production of natural products and other chemicals (microbial chemical factories).\n\nOnce introduced into the host cell as DNA, a synthetic device must first be expressed by the native transcriptional machinery in order to give rise to the desired function (e.g. production of transcript, desired protein, or metabolites, transduction of a signal",

As mentioned above, engineering of methyltrophic yeast can help to establish methanol biotransformation process for chemical biosynthesis, but the complex regulation of methanol metabolism hinders rational engineering.

Synthetic biology is described as the design of new biological parts and the (re-)design of existing biological systems for functional applications. Some synthetic biology applications include the development of synthetic microbes as chassis for recombinant therapeutic production and vaccine development. Microbial chassis are versatile platforms where various bacteria are engineered with genetic components for specific functionalities and address unmet application needs. Synthetic biology, entailing the design and manipulation of biological systems, assumes paramount importance in bioengineering and in silico biology. Computational tools for predicting essential genes and facilitating genome reduction are crucial, offering advantages such as simplified metabolism, improved production, and ease of manipulation. Genome annotation is discussed, focusing on identifying and labeling functional elements in a genome sequence. The generation of synthetic microbes or otherwise called microbial chassis requires the design of minimal genomes that are facilitated through genome-scale metabolic (GSM) models and are critical for chassis development [70]. Furthermore, genome-scale metabolic (GSM) models play a vital role in understanding metabolic capabilities, resource allocation, and adaptation in microbial chassis. \n\nThe advantages of chassis with minimal genome have been reported to reduce organism's complexity by allowing metabolic modeling and functional predictions with higher agility [38]. Improved genome stability has been demonstrated in genome-reduced Streptomyces chattanoogesis and E. coli strains by deleting biosynthetic clusters and error-prone DNA polymerase [12,18]. Another major advantage is that microbes with reduced genomes require lower bioenergy and this has been demonstrated with the 6.9% reduction of the genome of Lactococcus lactis N8 by deleting prophages and genomic islands, resulting in a shortened generation time by 17% [55]. Other benefits of genome-reduced strains include increased production of desired products, improved transformation efficiency, and ease of genetic manipulation [12].",

            "text": "Abstract Synthetic biology has grown exponentially in the last few years, with a variety of biological applications. One of the emerging applications of synthetic biology is to exploit the link between microorganisms, biologics, and human health. To exploit this link, it is critical to select effective synthetic biology tools for use in appropriate microorganisms that would address unmet needs in human health through the development of new game-changing applications and by complementing existing technological capabilities. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are considered appropriate chassis organisms that can be genetically engineered for therapeutic and industrial applications. Here, we have reviewed comprehensively various synthetic biology techniques for engineering probiotic LAB strains, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 mediated genome editing, homologous recombination, and recombineering. In addition, we also discussed heterologous protein expression systems used in engineering probiotic LAB. By combining computational biology with genetic engineering, there is a lot of potential to develop next-generation synthetic LAB with capabilities to address bottlenecks in industrial scale-up and complex biologics production. Recently, we started working on Lactochassis project where we aim to develop next generation synthetic LAB for biomedical application.",

            "text": "of biological systems engineering, synthetic biology requires the development of more tools for gene expression regulation to achieve precise and dynamic control of biological systems. The emerging tools will offer new solutions for the challenges facing medical therapy, energy sources, product manufacturing and so on. Most synthetic genetic tools rely on protein-DNA interactions to control gene circuits [11,12]. However, recent progress on RNA biology has brought attention to RNA-based components for understanding and programming biological systems. With highly modular components, such as siRNA, RNA aptamers, riboswitches, ribozymes etc., RNA molecules can be employed to regulate proteins, metabolites, or other nucleic acid molecules [13][14][15][16]. The roles of RNA molecules in specific physiological processes can be further identified by manipulation and regulation of RNAs, leading to the discovery of novel functions and design of new RNA regulators. Furthermore, the origin and evolution of life have been inspiring researchers over the years. The advances in research on the RNA world hypothesis provide more clues for the roles of RNA in the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nPhage research continues to drive the development of broader molecular biological research. The components of phages have been adapted as major parts for synthetic biology, including some key RNAacting elements. New clues are being discovered for biological evolution based on the phage lifecycle and interactions with host cells. This review highlights RNA-based technologies derived from phages and describes the RNA manipulation tools and RNA-based gene regulation techniques in terms of the phage components for obtaining more functional synthetic modules, the phage lifecycle for understanding and constructing specific artificial systems, and the phage-bacterial interactions for applying widely used technologies to different hosts (Fig. 1). These aspects are closely related and benefit the development of synthetic biology in aspects ranging from genetic circuit construction to chassis cell adaptation. Furthermore, the value of phage research for our understanding of biological evolution will be discussed to illustrate the roles of interacting elements including phages, RNA molecules and biological evolution. The review will further summarize challenges faced by phage-derived RNA-based technologies and prospect novel biotechnological opportunities.",

            "text": "For many non-model bacteria, especially novel species, these genetic part libraries are unavailable, and so, the necessary genetic parts must be created and characterized. In some cases, established genetic parts may be transferable from a model bacterium to a related species, such as promoters between Gram-positive bacteria (Liew et al., 2010). However, genetic parts often do not function equivalently between bacterial species or even strains (Tong et al., 2015;Leonard et al., 2018). Each CRISPRi/a component should be expressed using unique genetic parts to prevent repeated DNA sequences. Since dCas protein expression can elicit cytotoxicity, high strength promoters used for overexpression may not be optimal. If existing genetic parts are insufficient for a new bacterial species, identifying genetic regulatory elements from the endogenous genome provides an alternative to synthetic DNA design strategies (Fernandes et al., 2019). Libraries of genetic parts and inducible promoters are excellent tools to tune the expression of CRISPRi/a systems, and several studies have established such toolboxes in non-model bacteria to facilitate the development of genetic tools such as CRISPRi/a (Mimee et al., 2015;Leonard et al., 2018;Shin et al., 2019;Teh et al., 2019;Liow et al., 2020). These libraries and tunable parts are especially important to control the expression of the CRISPRi/a tool to minimize potential cellular toxicity and to precisely control transcriptional regulation (Qu et al., 2019;Bosch et al., 2021;Shabestary et al., 2021). \n\nIn the design of a synthetic CRISPRi/a system for a bacterium, consideration should be given to prevent interference with endogenous CRISPR systems and/or anti-CRISPR genes harbored on the strain's genome. If the foreign and native CRISPR-Cas types are too similar, the introduction of the synthetic gRNA may induce cleavage of the host bacterium's genome (via the catalytically active endogenous Cas enzyme) and can cause cell death in a DNA repair-deficient strain or undesired mutations if the strain has appropriate DNA repair pathways.",

This distinguishes synthetic biology from discovery bioscience, since it encompasses principles of design and construction, and is thereby obliged to address challenges of predictability and standardization that are more normally associated with engineering disciplines. The construction of synthetic circuitry is being applied to an increasing number of hosts to serve the purposes of both fundamental science and biotechnology (e.g. production of recombinant proteins and metabolites, biosensors, etc.). \n\nIn the component 'toolkits' currently used in synthetic biology, there is a predominance of transcriptional parts, more specifically promoters, transcription factors, transcription factor modulators (metabolites and other ligands) and transcription terminators [4][5][6][7]. Formulated somewhat differently, synthetic biology is currently largely about the design, construction and use of engineered DNA [8]. Transcriptional components and modules were inevitably the first choices for synthetic biology because there was a good depth of knowledge of a range of regulatable transcriptional systems in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. However, there are a number of reasons for exploring options at other points in the gene expression pathway that occur downstream of transcription. Utilizing solely regulatable promoters, for example, can, at least in certain host organisms (including yeast), result in a restricted choice of independently acting systems [9], a less than optimal dynamic range, physiologically (metabolically) disruptive activation/suppression mechanisms [10], and limitations in terms of features such as input-output matching and response times [11]. As a consequence, up-scaling of the size and complexity of logic gate circuitry has generally proved challenging (as has been illustrated by a recent comparison of attempts to build highcomplexity circuits [12]). \n\nHere, we examine the scope for development of posttranscriptional biocircuitry, considering the available mechanisms and layers of control.",

            "text": "Recent advances in synthetic biology can further enhance the environmental tolerance and bioproduction of microorganisms. Synthetic biology is an engineering approach to biology that aims to construct new biological systems (e.g., living organisms) to have novel-or enhanced-abilities or useful purposes (e.g., material production, sense-and-respond functionality). Some of the methods used by synthetic biologists include DNA manipulation technologies, as well as omits approaches (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proxemics, and metabonomics). The ability of microorganisms to survive (when necessary) while producing NPs and removing heavy metals largely depend on their adaptation to relevant environmental conditions. Under the extreme conditions in the cementitious materials (e.g., high ionic concentration, and high alkalinity), microorganisms' survival and capability in NP production and metal removal could be of critical importance. To elucidate the genetic underpinnings of microorganism biosynthesis and persistence, omits approaches have been adopted to examine genomes, transcriptases, and proteomes (Giovanella et al., 2020) and their governance rules on microorganism behavior. For example, genome sequencing is often conducted on extremophiles that exhibit a strong adaptation to harsh pH, temperature, pressure, salinity and others. In doing so, genes relevant to the versatile environmental adaptability are revealed (Giovanella et al., 2020).\n\nWith this understanding, genetic modification can be achieved by utilizing recombinant DNA technology and selective pressure for rational design and directed evolution. While rational design involves construction of a single strain that possesses desirable metabolic characteristics or proteins from different organisms to allow specific reactions using recombinant DNA technology (Ang et al., 2005), directed evolution engineers the organism for improved characteristics through mutagenesis and environmental pressure based on Darwinian principles of mutation and selection (Hibbert and Dalby, 2005).\n\nBased on this genetic engineering, genetically engineered microorganisms can be produced that exhibit boosted biosynthesis or efficiency in heavy metal removal. Heterologous biosynthesis pathways can also be engineered into non-native producer organisms (Kumar et al., 2013). For",

Promoter mini-pools with different activity levels were developed in R. opacus PD630 and R. ruber TH by using different fluorescent reporter genes, \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ), and nitrilase (NHase) as different promoter activity probes (Jiao et al. 2018;DeLorenzo et al. 2017). In detail, the three chemically inducible promoters pBAD, pTet, and pAcet deriving from E. coli or Mycobacterium smegmatis were optimized for R. opacus PD630 as well as two classes of metabolite sensors responsive to nitrogen levels and specific aromatic monomers, typically found in depolymerized lignin, e.g., phenol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, guaiacol. \n\nAlthough promoter libraries, reporter genes, and shuttle vectors have been developed for Rhodococcus as genetic tools, the genome editing of these bacteria has been hampered by its high GC content (~ 70%) and by low transformation/ recombination efficiency (DeLorenzo et al. 2017(DeLorenzo et al. , 2018;;Jiao et al. 2018;Liang et al. 2020). Recently, DeLorenzo et al. ( 2018) developed a recombineering method for site-specific gene insertion and deletion, which was based on the activity of the bacteriophage recombinases Che9c60 and Che9c61 in PD630.",

            "text": "This growth is connected with the conceptual and technical progresses that have taken place in biological engineering in the last years. Indeed, it would be wrong to merely link the success of biotechnological companies with the public and private funds gathered, particularly in the case of synthetic biology. In fact, the standardization of biotechnology is one of the main goals of synthetic biology, which aims at the design of biological systems from an engineering perspective (Khalil and Collins, 2010). If achieved, biological standardization is expected to boost the development of biotechnological products and processes, by improving the predictability and robustness of their underlying biological circuits. However, there are important cultural and technical issues that certainly hamper the development of synthetic biology in Europe. One of those is a lack of trust in the analogy between biology and engineering that lies at the very core of synthetic biology. Indeed, the field has classically identified cells as living machines, but there are solid reasons to cast doubts on the exactness of such a metaphor (Porcar and Peret o, 2016). It has to be stressed that successes in most of the biotechnological projects considered as synthetic biology have in fact been the consequence of trial-anderror strategies rather than the result of a generalized standardization in biology. The difficulties biological standardization faces are the intraspecific variation in heterologous protein production (i.e. variation depending on the strain of E. coli being transformed); the cell-tocell variation in output signal intensity or the non-orthogonal effects of simple biological circuits on each other, as we have previously reported (Vilanova et al., 2015). All these limitations can be summarized in a simple way: true standards in synthetic microbiology do not exist to this date. \n\nBoth the potential and limitations of standardization in SB are exemplified by the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, in which students worldwide present synthetic biology projects based on organisms engineered from a toolbox of BioBricks TM . However, Biobricks TM has limitations as universal building blocks in SB (Vilanova and Porcar, 2014 Galdzicki et al., 2014).",

This is probably one of the most obvious candidates for standardization, as the tools developed for a particular research approach can benefit the whole community.\n\nStandards are required for the collection and distribution of tools. Cataloguing, depositing and distributing tools under the same platform give access to the detailed history of the tool, while encouraging tool comparison and sharing. Initial attempts of standardizing tools' structure and distribution have a brief but promising history:\n\nBiobricks as a platform for democratizing synthetic biology (parts.igem.org/Help:An_Introduction_to_BioBric ks), AddGene as a distribution channel (addgene.org/), SEVA collection as a standard vector collection (seva.c nb.csic.es; Silva-Rocha et al., 2013), OpenMTA for material exchange and transfer agreements (Kahl et al., 2018) and a universal Golden Gate standard for photosynthetic organisms (Patron et al., 2015;Vavitsas et al., 2019) are steps towards standardized cloning practices, making parts developed for different organisms interchangeable.\n\nAll the aforementioned examples were the first steps to initiate changes towards the standardization of tools in synthetic biology. However, there is still room for improvement concerning part characterizations and predictable outputs, the completion of which could help to achieve more predictable research outcomes.",

Besides, microalgae have the unique advantages of being photoautotrophic and harboring both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, becoming a popular host for recombinant proteins. Currently, numerous advanced molecular tools related to microalgal transgenesis have been explored and established, especially for the model species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( C. reinhardtii hereafter). The development of genetic tools and the emergence of new strategies further increase the feasibility of developing C. reinhardtii chloroplasts as green factories, and the strong genetic operability of C. reinhardtii endows it with enormous potential as a synthetic biology platform. At present, C. reinhardtii chloroplasts could successfully produce plenty of recombinant proteins, including antigens, antibodies, antimicrobial peptides, protein hormones and enzymes. However, additional techniques and toolkits for chloroplasts need to be developed to achieve efficient and markerless editing of plastid genomes. Mining novel genetic elements and selectable markers will be more intensively studied in the future, and more factors affecting protein expression are urged to be explored. This review focuses on the latest technological progress of selectable markers for Chlamydomonas chloroplast genetic engineering and the factors that affect the efficiency of chloroplast protein expression.

Protein engineering, enzyme engineering and metabolic engineering fields can be assumed as predecessors of synthetic biology -enabling researchers to alter the sequence and function of proteins or enzymes, or indeed entire metabolic pathways, paved the way to a more flexible and unhindered Lego brick-based attitude of synthetic biology that followed [9,10]. \n\nWhile enzyme engineering was first performed with immobilization methods and complemented with detailed kinetic studies in 1980s, the use of recombinant DNA technology to optimize proteins or enzymes for particular desired phenotypes or properties became mainstream in 1990s, mainly relying on technologies such as random or site-directed mutagenesis, phagedisplay and other [11,12]. Nobel Laureate Prof Frances Arnold is most renowned for her work on directed evolution of enzymes for industrial production of metabolites and commercial application of such catalysts and their use in this field have become possible [13,14].

            "text": "BackgroundThe underlying goal of synthetic biology is to make the process of engineering biological systems easier. Recent work has focused on defining and developing standard biological parts. The technical standard that has gained the most traction in the synthetic biology community is the BioBrick standard for physical composition of genetic parts. Parts that conform to the BioBrick assembly standard are BioBrick standard biological parts. To date, over 2,000 BioBrick parts have been contributed to, and are available from, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.ResultsHere we extended the same advantages of BioBrick standard biological parts to the plasmid-based vectors that are used to provide and propagate BioBrick parts. We developed a process for engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts. We designed a new set of BioBrick parts that encode many useful vector functions. We combined the new parts to make a BioBrick base vector that facilitates BioBrick vector construction. We demonstrated the utility of the process by constructing seven new BioBrick vectors. We also successfully used the resulting vectors to assemble and propagate other BioBrick standard biological parts.ConclusionWe extended the principles of part reuse and standardization to BioBrick vectors. As a result, myriad new BioBrick vectors can be readily produced from all existing and newly designed BioBrick parts. We invite the synthetic biology community to (1) use the process to make and share new BioBrick vectors; (2) expand the current collection of BioBrick vector parts; and (3) characterize and improve the available collection of BioBrick vector parts.",

            "text": "Computational tools are essential for synthetic biology to support the design procedure at different levels. Due to the lack of quantitative characterizations of biological parts, most design procedures are iterative requiring experimental validation to enable subsequent refinements (Canton et al., 2008). Furthermore, stochastic noise, uncertainty about the cellular environment of an engineered system, and little insulation of components complicate the design process and require corresponding models and analysis methods (Di Ventura et al., 2006). Many computational standards and tools developed in the field of systems biology (Wierling et al., 2007) are applicable for synthetic biology as well. \n\nAs previously discussed, synthetic gene circuits can be constructed from a handful of basic parts that can be described independently and assembled into interoperating modules of different complexity. For this purpose, standardization and modularity of parts at different levels is required (Canton et al., 2008). The Registry of Standard Biological Parts constitutes a reference point for current research in synthetic biology and it provides relevant information on several DNA-based synthetic or natural building blocks. Most computational tools that specifically support the design of artificial gene circuits use information from the abovementioned registry. Moreover, many of these tools share standardized formats for the input/output files. The System Biology Markup Language (SBML) (http://sbml.org) defines a widely accepted, XML-based format for the exchange of mathematical models in biology. It provides a concise representation of the chemical reactions embraced by a biological system. These can be translated into systems of ODEs or into reaction systems amenable to stochastic simulations (Alon, 2003). Despite its large applicability to simulations, SBML currently lacks modularity, which is not well aligned with parts registries in synthetic biology. Alternatively, synthetic gene systems can be described according to CellML language which is more modular (Cooling et al., 2008). One important feature to enable the assembly of standard biological parts into gene circuits is that they share common inputs and outputs. Endy (2005) proposed RNA polymerases and ribosomes as the molecules that physically exchange information between parts. Their fluxes, measured in PoPS (Polymerase Per Second) and in RiPS (Ribosomes Per Second) represent biological currents (Canton et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Synthetic biology (SB) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The term \u201cSB\u201d can be traced back to 1912 to Stephane Leduc\u2019s book La Biologie Synthetique. The next direct reference to the term is found in 1974 when Waclaw Szybalski, in only a few sentences, laid the foundations for the emerging field of SB. The new wave of SB aims to design and engineer biologically based parts, novel devices, and networks as well as redesigning existing, natural biological pathways. Hence, SB has the potential to deliver significant technological benefits and economic growth. \n \nSynthetic biology has already made a resounding impact in fundamental and applied research. Currently it has broad applications in a number of areas including medicine, the environment and energy, agriculture, and food industries. Selected milestones and significant achievements include the reconstruction of a complete microbial genome (Gibson et al., 2010), the synthesis of a yeast chromosome (Dymond et al., 2011), and most recently, the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high levels of a key precursor of the antimalarial drug artemisinin (Paddon et al., 2013). \n \nSynthetic Biology: Tools and Applications, edited by Huimin Zhao (University of Illinois) provides a comprehensive coverage and a succinct overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge on SB (Zhao, 2013). The overall scope of the book is based on a review article (Zhao, 2013) published in Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine (Liang et al., 2011). On more than 300 pages, structured into 17 chapters, Synthetic Biology: Tools and Applications brings together thought leaders and leading researchers in SB, by providing a systematic and integrated framework to examine key enabling components in SB. \n \nThe era of SB has arrived. As tellingly described in the introduction by the editor, SB builds on the advances in molecular, and systems biology and seeks to revolutionize life sciences in the same way that chemical synthesis revolutionized chemistry and integrated circuit design revolutionized computing. In addition, the number of publications on SB has increased exponentially in recent years. As a consequence, it is almost impossible to follow the rush of SB-literature in detail. Furthermore, the emergence of SB has been accompanied by the development of new and improved experimental tools and",

            "text": "A primary goal of plant synthetic biology is to produce predictable and programmable genetic circuits from simple regulatory elements and well-characterized genetic components. McCarthy and Medford provide a detailed review of the development of quantitative and predictive genetic parts for plant synthetic biology. In this context, the quantitative properties and transfer function of a variety of genetic parts are needed which can be aided by computer based selection of the optimal components to be assembled into functional devices. The review highlights challenges with synthetic biology approaches in complex organisms like plants composed of differentiated cells and tissues, with unique regulatory or developmental contexts affecting the introduced synthetic genetic circuits. Being able to measure the function of plant components within the context of a living plant cell will be essential for exploiting these components in gene circuits with predictable function. The need for mathematical modeling to account for variable contexts is discussed. \n\nIn the research paper by Persad et al., the need to develop technologies to precisely regulate gene expression and engineer complex genetic circuits into plant chassis is addressed experimentally. The Q-system from Neurospora crassa, which is a powerful repressible-and engineerable-binary system, has been repurposed in a variety of eukaryotic systems. The functionality of the Q-system in plants is demonstrated using transient expression in soybean protoplasts and in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The modulated expression of reporter genes is demonstrated as is a potential application for plant-based biosensors, thus demonstrating that the Q-system has potential as a powerful orthogonal tool for precise control of gene expression in plants.",

At present, a considerable number of genetically modified strains have the same growth rate as S.cerevisiae, such as Synechoccoccus elongatus UTEX 2973, which has shortened the division time of cyanobacteria to 2 hours 20 . On the other hand, lack of molecular tools limits the development of cyanobacteria engineering strains, so that the product yield of cyanobacteria is lower than that of E. coli, yeast, and other traditional hosts. Conversely, in the past few years, cyanobacteria-specific tools and components have increased at a staggering rate, including development based on CRISPR-Cas systems 21 , which promoted the widespread adoption of synthetic biological paradigms. For example, The biological tools was designed by the combination of recombination standardized parts or modules ( such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, coding sequences, and Terminators) and CRISPR-Cas system 22 . Among them, many of these tools were originally developed in E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which have been adapted and modified for cyanobacteria 23,24 . In recent years, CRISPR-Cas system has developed into a revolutionary method for genome editing 25,26 . RNA directs the Cas protein to the target site and induces double-strand break (DSB) 27 . DNA breaks can be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous directed repair (HDR) 28 . Traditional gene editing tools, such as TALENs and ZFNs, have some disadvantages, such as complex module assembly, high cost, timeconsuming, easy to miss, and difficult to operate 29 , which greatly limit their application. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas system has the advantages of high efficiency and easy manipulation. It can induce double-strand breaks with reasonable specificity, locates flexibly in the genome, and complete a variety of genetic modifications in parallel, so it was rapidly developed as a versatile tool in genome editing 30 .",

            "text": "BackgroundRecombinant protein production is a process of great industrial interest, with products that range from pharmaceuticals to biofuels. Since high level production of recombinant protein imposes significant stress in the host organism, several methods have been developed over the years to optimize protein production. So far, these trial-and-error techniques have proved laborious and sensitive to process parameters, while there has been no attempt to address the problem by applying Synthetic Biology principles and methods, such as integration of standardized parts in novel synthetic circuits.ResultsWe present a novel self-regulatory protein production system that couples the control of recombinant protein production with a stress-induced, negative feedback mechanism. The synthetic circuit allows the down-regulation of recombinant protein expression through a stress-induced promoter. We used E. coli as the host organism, since it is widely used in recombinant processes. Our results show that the introduction of the self-regulatory circuit increases the soluble/insoluble ratio of recombinant protein at the expense of total protein yield. To further elucidate the dynamics of the system, we developed a computational model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data, and provides insight on the interplay between protein solubility and yield.ConclusionOur work introduces the idea of a self-regulatory circuit for recombinant protein products, and paves the way for processes with reduced external control or monitoring needs. It demonstrates that the library of standard biological parts serves as a valuable resource for initial synthetic blocks that needs to be further refined to be successfully applied in practical problems of biotechnological significance. Finally, the development of a predictive model in conjunction with experimental validation facilitates a better understanding of the underlying dynamics and can be used as a guide to experimental design.",

            "text": "Thermophilic bacteria, which thrive at temperatures greater than 50\u00b0C, require special adaptation strategies at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels. The pattern of synonymous codon usage within thermophilic prokaryotes is different from that within mesophilic ones [1][2][3][4][5][6]. This difference is the result of natural selection linked to thermophily [1,6]. Differences in codon usage between species adversely affect recombinant gene expression levels, thus gene optimization is often needed to obtain adequate expression levels, which is especially important for industrial enzyme production processes. Natural REase-coding genes found in wild-type (wt) organisms are often not highly expressed, due to the 'toxicity' of their protein product to their hosts, if not fully protected by cognate MTases. The subtle balance between both enzymatic activities, comprising the restrictionmodification (RM) system, can be affected by environmental conditions and lead to the cell's death, caused by genome damage. Moreover, this problem is much more pronounced in a recombinant host, harbouring the cloned RM system, due to the different coding gene regulatory circuits. Recent development in artificial gene synthesis has enabled the construction of synthetic genes [7][8][9][10], and thus made possible the rational design of artificial genes and their functional clusters, described as a 'synthetic biology' approach. Synthetic biology can be used to overcome problems of low gene expression in heterologous hosts, which is a crucial economical aspect in industrial gene expression. Although the gene expression is highly correlated with codon usage, the problem is not as simply defined or solved. A general preference for the use of codons of the highest frequency in the genome or in the highly expressed gene subset of the host is not necessarily a guarantee of improved expression [10,11].\n\nTo aid the gene design process, computational tools have been developed [12]. Typically, two strategies have been used for codon optimization. The first one, known as 'one amino acid-one codon' assigns the most abundant codon of the recombinant host or a set of selected genes to a given amino acid (aa) in the target sequence",

            "text": "Several iterations of the same gene may therefore be required to optimise yield. \n\nA powerful approach used in synthetic biology is the application of modularity. The commonlyapplied Golden Gate assembly method uses Type IIS restriction enzymes for modular one-pot DNA assembly [35], and may be used to rapidly construct and screen promoter-gene pairs to identify the optimal configuration for gene expression. Golden Gate assembly has previously been used to optimise production of benzylpenicillin in S. cerevisiae [36] and to optimize production of \u03b2-carotene in Y. lipolytica [37]. A disadvantage of such systems is the occurrence of internally-cutting restriction sites, which may necessitate removal through synonymous recoding. \n\nFurther enabling technologies include genome-editing tools, such as the powerful CRISPR/ Cas9 [38], which may be multiplexed to introduce several nucleotide modifications simultaneously. CRISPR has also recently been applied to introduce a library of genetic parts into the yeast genome to rapidly develop gain-of-function in an automated manner [39]. Comparatively newer developments also include CRISPR/Cpf1 [40]. \n\nAs opposed to optimising metabolic pathway function at the genetic level, a promising approach includes control of enzyme behaviour at the protein level. Compartmentalisation may be used to spatially and temporally separate key metabolic enzymes and locally optimise their behaviour. Localising pathway enzymes to intracellular compartments may be used to increase local substrate concentration, prevent efflux or diffusion of pathway intermediates, prevent interference from competing pathways, reduce intermediate toxicity or spatially separate unwanted side-reactions to allow spontaneous product formation to occur [11]. Synthetic, non-endogenous organelles were recently constructed in S. cerevisiae [41], which represent ideal microcompartments for enzyme function isolated from the host cell machinery. The nanocomparments, based on self-assembling encapsulin proteins from the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, were shown to protect cargo proteins from protease degradation and act as nanoreactors for enzyme function. \n\nSynthetic biology technologies are most mature in S. cerevisiae.",

            "text": "Synthetic biologists aim to 'redesign' or 'reformulate' nature. First, however, they tend to reformulate the way we talk about biological systems. Many new terms are borrowed from (electrical) engineering or programming and then applied to molecules and cells that are actually quite unlike the screws, wires and circuits from the engineering catalogs. The new language does thus not necessarily compensate for lack of words but is itself part of the experiment. Some engineering terms have taken on new meaning and inspired new experiments in synthetic biology. In particular, these include 'part', 'device', and 'system' (13). Exact definitions are still evolving and here we re-iterate what we think is the emerging consensus. \n\nA 'Part' is a component of some functional interest. Protein parts may, for example, be single domains, reusable linker sequences or signal peptides and purification tags. Such basic parts can be recombined into composite fusion proteins, which are still considered parts because they form single molecules. Parts define the physical units within an engineered system. \n\nA 'Device' is a collection of one or more parts that operate together and expose a defined (standardized) functional interface. Unlike individual parts, the different components of a device may or may not be physically connected. Importantly though, devices guarantee to interoperate with other devices according to rules of 'functional composition'. Devices thus define the functional units within an engineered system. \n\nThis idea of a device goes beyond Endy's original definition (13). A simple illustration is given in Figure 3: a protease cleaving a specific peptide sequence qualifies as a part but not as a device because detailed knowledge or customization is needed for its application. However, the same protease together with its cognate peptide would qualify: This 'proteolysis device' would take its own transcription as an input and would split any two protein parts that are fused right and left of its cognate peptide. The complexity of substrate recognition and specificity is thus encapsulated and of no concern to the engineer. Different proteolysis devices could be optimized for different catalytic efficiencies or different environments.",

            "text": "Plant synthetic biology is an established but continuously growing field that combines the engineering principles of decoupling, abstraction, and standardization with plant biology to provide plant systems with new traits and functions (1). Plants naturally offer a myriad of metabolic resources that can be harnessed by modern synthetic biol-ogy to tackle current challenges in the food supply chain, energy production, pest management, or manufacturing of valuable biologicals for medicine and industry (2). Some recent efforts in plant synthetic biology have introduced new metabolic pathways and gene circuits to improve relevant traits such as crop productivity, vitamin fortification (3,4), fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (5), or photosynthesis (5)(6)(7). While significant advances are being made, introducing novel or improved functions into plant systems often results in unpredicted adverse effects due to the complexity of their metabolism and signaling networks (8). Engineering new functions into living organisms requires precise control over the synthetic gene circuits to ensure optimal use of the metabolic resources available, while minimizing collateral deleterious effects. Synthetic biologists have developed a variety of regulatory tools to strictly control complex circuits, which has enabled the development of finely-tuned designed functions in bacterial and mammalian systems (9). This success stemmed from the extensive characterization of standard genetic devices and molecular tools that can be combined to build increasingly complex functions. The implementation of such complex circuits in plants has been more challenging due to the limited availability of welldocumented genetic elements as well as the technical limitations of high-throughput plant transformation and circuit characterization (1,8,10). Therefore, current efforts in plant synthetic biology are aimed to develop reliable DNA assembly standards (phytobricks) to allow more efficient biodesign of genetic elements that can be used to build highly regulated synthetic plant functions (11,12). \n\nEarly synthetic regulatory devices relied on the transient use of activators and repressors to control transcription, which required a constant supply of inducers to sustain the desired cell output (13). Several chemically-inducible systems have been adapted to plant biotechnology to achieve transcriptional control, such as ethanol (14), glucocorticoids (15,16), copper (17,18), or insecticide-inducible pro-moters (19).",

            "text": "Indeed, these are powerful kits offering a large library of DNA parts, including promoters, ribosome binding sites, ORFs, and terminators stored in entry vectors. A user then chooses a combination of entry vectors and digests and ligates them into a destination vector via a one-pot reaction. While these kits provide exceptional flexibility and scalability in vector design, they are overly complex for routine applications and present a high barrier to entry for labs new to recombinant protein purification. Furthermore, these kits are optimized for synthetic biology rather than protein biochemistry. For example, the design of vectors with multiple features, such as tandem affinity purification tags, each with unique protease sites, will significantly complicate the design of overhangs and cleavage sites and require a huge number of entry plasmids due to the combinatorial nature of the kits. The use of numerous entry vectors may also decrease cloning efficiency (Engler et al., 2009). Finally, the numerous unique overhangs required to stitch together different entry vectors lead to cloning scars that may not be compatible with structural biology. By contrast, our approach is much simpler and only requires mixing a gene synthesis/PCR product with a single preassembled plasmid. The simple design minimizes cloning scars, and the reduced number of components in the pET28b-GG reaction will improve reaction efficiency compared to more complex reactions. Indeed, all 40 colonies we tested had the correct insert. \n\nA limitation of our study is that we did not modify key vector features such as the copy number, plasmid size, promoter strength, or other regulatory elements for expression of the target protein. Future application of this strategy could involve Golden Gate domestication of other workhorse vectors with different features or leveraging the scalability of existing modular cloning techniques to create a new library of pre-assembled vectors. \n\nIn conclusion, the pET28b-GG vector series provides a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for recombinant protein expression and purification. The modular design and compatibility with a single cloning strategy streamline workflows and make it an excellent tool for both experienced researchers and educational laboratories.",

The biofuel production from alternative sources discussed in previous sections is already one good example for resolving the mounting energy demand in a sustainable way. Here in this section, we collectively report on the discussions on food, agriculture and other environmental applications. \n\nSignificant investment has been put into food and agriculture technologies that could provide solutions to keep up with the pace of the growing global population and climate change. One perpetual theme is centered on boosting the yield of crops or improving the nutrient components in food products. Plant synthetic biology has witnessed progress in genome-editing-enabled precision breeding, which significantly reduces the time needed for selecting desirable traits. 151 Among its wide applications in agriculture, there are three strategies in boosting crop yields, namely increasing carbon fixation efficiency, minimizing plant respiratory CO 2 loss, and establishing nitrogen fixation mechanisms in non-legume crops. 152 On nitrogen fixation, there are genetic engineering methods for crop plants, cereal crops in most studies, to express heterologous nitrogenase genes or to form nodule-like symbiosis similar to legume roots; others seek to engineer bacteria that are naturally associated with cereal crops to carry out nitrogen fixation. 153,154 In China, plant synthetic biologists are using genome editing to engineer aromatic rice and wheat resistant to powdery mildew. 155 Rice, the staple food in Asia, has also been genetically modified to be resistant to bacterial blight. 156 Currently, an array of genome editing technologies are being developed in 9 Asian countries to engineer food crops, primarily for disease resistance. 157 ese projects are still in the research and development phase and no product has reached the market yet. 157 Notably, unlike the US and EU, Asian countries have not made their position clear on crops with edited genomes; therefore, it remains to be seen if these countries will follow in US's footsteps of approving engineered crops with no foreign DNA. 155 It is likely that these countries might be in favor of cultivation of engineered crops once the indigenously developed products are ready.",

            "text": "In this study, a DNA assembly strategy that utilizes standardized linker sequences was developed to enable modular construction via a variety of overlap-directed assembly methods. A variation of the MODAL strategy was also introduced that facilitates the rapid production of construct libraries with mutation applied only to defined parts. To assist our strategy, an online software tool, R2oDNA Designer, was developed that produces sets of efficient linker sequences suitable for different projects. \n\nModular linker regions are tolerated in intergenic regions of plasmids but affect expression levels when within genes \n\nWhen combined with the standard prefix and suffix adapter sequences used for amplification, the linkers we describe here add a region of 75 bp of synthetic DNA between assembled parts. Between gene-level parts, this synthetic DNA appears to be well-tolerated and does not affect expression levels of assembled parts. However, at the sub-gene-level DNA assembly, where ORFs and promoters are linked to make genes and operons, significant differences in expression levels were observed. This observation ties in with those made recently by several groups investigating the role local flanking DNA sequences have on defined biological parts. DNA sequences immediately at the junctions between the promoter, RBS and ORF parts of E. coli operons appear to dramatically affect part function (45,(49)(50)(51)(52). Similar effects have also been observed to some extent in yeast (53). These local context effects all occur at DNA sequences that are transcribed as part of the mRNA, as we have seen here. While this feature of varied gene expression from the same modular parts can be embraced as a rapid means to provide diversity in gene expression, it also prevents predictability. Fortunately, three recent studies have developed new classes of RNA processing biological parts that act to alleviate these effects to regain predictable gene expression (50)(51)(52). \n\nOutside of the transcribed regions of genes within the intergenic space, the addition of synthetic DNA sequences such as those given here may actually provide some level of insulation against local context effects of neighboring parts simply by providing spacing. A recent cautionary tale has shown how an unwanted promoter can be unintentionally created within a construct by BioBrick assembly of four non-promoter parts (54).",

Orthogonal and synthetic genetic control elements bring stringent control and dynamic range to expression systems by providing specificity, limiting off-target effects, and expanding control of expression strength. For example, directed evolution experiments result in RNA polymerase variants with improved function and these new polymerases are then added to the toolkit for the target biological system. As another example, screening of promoter libraries results in characterized promoter strengths allowing a tunable range of expression within the target biological system. CRISPR/Cas9 has brought site-specific genome editing to a number of novel biological systems and CRISPR systems are continuing to improve in orthogonality and diversity. advanced the number of parts that could be screened and tested in diverse fungi. 208 The further expansion of genusspecific modular cloning toolkits, such as TrichoGate for Trichoderma 209 will facilitate functional genomics studies, especially in instances where codon bias or expression variation may limit the interchangeability or usefulness of parts in existing MoClo toolkit libraries. \n\nDevelopment of additional fungi as expression systems is quite limited compared to popular expression systems such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Although genome integration is the predominant route for genetic engineering of filamentous fungi, the addition of reliable and long-lasting episomal vectors would increase the speed of rapid prototyping efforts and would thus be a welcome addition to the fungal genetic toolbox. Most recently, Mozsik et al. released a 96-part toolkit for Penicillium and Aspergillus species, with parts enabling characterization of expression via genomic integration or autonomous vector replication through an AMA1-like sequence. 210 The AMA1 sequence was originally identified in Aspergillus nidulans as part of an extrachromosomal replicating plasmid and is capable of replication in a number of Aspergillus species. 211,212",

            "text": "CRISPR Cas9 has been successfully applied to optimize metabolic pathways in microorganism enhance the production of therapeutic proteins such as insulin, and activate dorma biosynthetic clusters to discover novel bioactive compounds, including antibiotics an vaccines [32,33]. These innovations continue to advance biopharmaceutical developme and shape its future (Figure 1). CRISPR-Cas systems are widely utilized in modern genetic engineering due to their high precision and efficiency. This system enables the targeted modification of specific genes within microbial genomes, facilitating the introduction of precise mutations, the removal of inhibitory regulatory elements, or the integration of novel biosynthetic pathways. Such genetic modifications enhance production efficiency while reducing metabolic burden [34]. For example, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been utilized to genetically modify Escherichia coli, optimizing its protein expression framework to achieve increased yields of recombinant insulin [35]. A comprehensive review by Dong et al. [36] focuses on the development of CRISPR/Cas9 systems for Escherichia coli, emphasizing their capability to enable high-precision and efficient genome editing for applications in metabolic engineering and pharmaceutical development. With the advancement of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, progress in genetic engineering has significantly expanded the scope of microbial systems in pharmaceutical development [37]. For instance, a study by Alberti and Corre [38] explored innovative approaches to utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 systems for editing Streptomyces genomes, demonstrating their potential in the discovery of novel antimicrobial natural products. The study highlighted the development of several CRISPR/Cas9-based tools, including pCRISPomyces plasmids, which enable the efficient and precise manipulation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). These advancements not only enhance the production of bioactive compounds but also lay the foundation for optimizing microbial systems for therapeutic applications. \n\nA recent study by Andrea Ameruoso and colleagues [39] demonstrated the application of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) systems to activate dormant biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces venezuelae.",

                "snippets": "The first wave of synthetic biology focused upon the combination of basic elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and transcriptional repressors to form modules with specified behaviours. Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes (Lienert et al., 2014)(Black et al., 2017). Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches (Gardner et al., 2000), pulse generators (Basu et al., 2004), oscillators (Tigges et al., 2009) and digital logic gates (Rinaudo et al., 2007). These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation...Thanks to the advances in systems biology as well as the emergence of new powerful tools that allow scientists to synthesise and create DNA, we are no longer limited to physical DNA samples isolated from organisms (Kong et al., 2007)[11](Kartalov et al., 2004). The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells.",

Here we present a synthetic multicellular bacterial system where receiver cells exhibit transient gene expression in response to a long-lasting signal from neighboring sender cells. The engineered sender cells synthesize an inducer, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which freely diffuses to spatially proximate receiver cells. The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP. Based on simulation models, we engineered variants of the pulse-generator circuit that exhibit different quantitative responses such as increased duration and intensity of the pulse. As shown by our models and experiments, the maximum amplitude and timing of the pulse depend not only on the final inducer concentration, but also on its rate of increase. The ability to differentiate between various rates of increase in inducer concentrations affords the system a unique spatiotemporal behavior for cells grown on solid media. Specifically, receiver cells can respond to communication from nearby sender cells while completely ignoring communication from senders cells further away, despite the fact that AHL concentrations eventually reach high levels everywhere. Because of the resemblance to naturally occurring feed-forward motifs, the pulse generator can serve as a model to improve our understanding of such systems.",

In this work, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first gene synthesis in a microfluidic environment. The use of microfluidic technology greatly reduces reaction volumes and the corresponding reagent and handling costs. Additionally, microfluidic technology enables large numbers of complex reactions to be performed in parallel. Here, we report the fabrication of a multi-chamber microfluidic device and its use in carrying out the syntheses of several DNA constructs. Genes up to 1\u2009kb in length were synthesized in parallel at minute starting oligonucleotide concentrations (10\u201325\u2009nM) in four 500\u2009nl reactors. Such volumes are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those utilized in conventional gene synthesis. The identity of all target genes was verified by sequencing, and the resultant error rate was determined to be 1 per 560 bases."

Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes (Lienert et al., 2014)(Black et al., 2017). Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches (Gardner et al., 2000), pulse generators (Basu et al., 2004), oscillators (Tigges et al., 2009) and digital logic gates (Rinaudo et al., 2007). These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation"

The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells."

Although a few intrinsic prokaryotic transcription terminators are used routinely, termination efficiencies have not been studied systematically. Here, we developed and validated a genetic architecture that enables reliable measurement of termination efficiencies. We then assembled a collection of 61 natural and synthetic terminators that collectively encode termination efficiencies across an \u223c800-fold dynamic range within Escherichia coli. We simulated co-transcriptional RNA folding dynamics to identify competing secondary structures that might interfere with terminator folding kinetics or impact termination activity. We found that structures extending beyond the core terminator stem are likely to increase terminator activity. By excluding terminators encoding such context-confounding elements, we were able to develop a linear sequence-function model that can be used to estimate termination efficiencies (r = 0.9, n = 31) better than models trained on all terminators (r = 0.67, n = 54). The resulting systematically measured collection of terminators should improve the engineering of synthetic genetic systems and also advance quantitative modeling of transcription termination."

Synthetic biology involves the design and assembly of genetic circuits to create new biological functions. By understanding the native genetic circuits that are usually optimized via evolution and reconstructing them from modular design, bioengineers can use synthetic biology to build systems with novel activity. (Polizzi, 2013) In the early stage of synthetic biology, simple gene circuits could be built to be precisely executed to recapitulate patterns of certain natural biological systems in bacteria, such as oscillating gene expression networks, multistate toggle switches, logic computation, and intercellular signaling networks. (Elowitz et al., 2000)(Gardner et al., 2000)(Hasty et al., 2002) Following these early successes, significant progress has been made, such as new modular genetic parts with standardized design and connectivity principles to streamline the construction of novel circuits with greater complexity. (Khalil et al., 2010)(Purnick et al., 2009) However, most of the early success of synthetic biology is performed in prokaryotic cells, while it remains difficult to directly transfer the methods into eukaryotic cells due to the complexity of the genetic networks. With the discovery of more precise genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, researchers have begun to interrogate and control gene function and network dynamics in eukaryotic cells. (Cong et al., 2015) CRISPR/ Cas9 allows precise targeting of specific genome loci. When genetically engineered to pair with functional domains, this precise control has enabled the construction of multilayered gene circuits with higher-order functions in mammalian cells.

We demonstrate that using the input-output transfer curves of our TALERs enables accurate prediction of the behavior of modularly assembled TALER cascade and switch circuits. We also show that TALER switches employing feedback regulation exhibit improved accuracy for microRNA-based HeLa cancer cell classification versus HEK293 cells.

Synthetic biology involves the design and assembly of genetic circuits to create new biological functions. By understanding the native genetic circuits that are usually optimized via evolution and reconstructing them from modular design, bioengineers can use synthetic biology to build systems with novel activity. (Polizzi, 2013) In the early stage of synthetic biology, simple gene circuits could be built to be precisely executed to recapitulate patterns of certain natural biological systems in bacteria, such as oscillating gene expression networks, multistate toggle switches, logic computation, and intercellular signaling networks. (Elowitz et al., 2000)(Gardner et al., 2000)(Hasty et al., 2002) Following these early successes, significant progress has been made, such as new modular genetic parts with standardized design and connectivity principles to streamline the construction of novel circuits with greater complexity. (Khalil et al., 2010)(Purnick et al., 2009) However, most of the early success of synthetic biology is performed in prokaryotic cells, while it remains difficult to directly transfer the methods into eukaryotic cells due to the complexity of the genetic networks. With the discovery of more precise genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, researchers have begun to interrogate and control gene function and network dynamics in eukaryotic cells. (Cong et al., 2015) CRISPR/ Cas9 allows precise targeting of specific genome loci. When genetically engineered to pair with functional domains, this precise control has enabled the construction of multilayered gene circuits with higher-order functions in mammalian cells.

Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate. BIO-PC enables reliable execution of distributed DNA-based molecular programs in biologically relevant environments and opens new directions in DNA computing and minimal cell technology.Semipermeable proteinosome membranes allow complex DNA message communication through compartmentalization and protect the DNA circuits from degradation in a biological environment."

Although a few intrinsic terminators and RBSs are used routinely, their translation and termination efficiencies have not been systematically studied in Actinobacteria. Here, we analyzed the influence of the regions surrounding RBSs on gene expression in these bacteria. We demonstrated that inappropriate RBSs can reduce the expression efficiency of a gene to zero. We developed a genetic device \u2013 an in vivo RBS-selector \u2013 that allows selection of an optimal RBS for any gene of interest, enabling rational control of the protein expression level. In addition, a genetic tool that provides the opportunity for measurement of termination efficiency was developed. Using this tool, we found strong terminators that lead to a 17\u2013100-fold reduction in downstream expression and are characterized by sufficient sequence diversity to reduce homologous recombination when used with other elements. For the first time, a C-terminal degradation tag was employed for the control of protein stability in Streptomyces.

However, the complexity of biology makes it difficult to predict the extent to which such efforts will succeed. As a first practical example, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts started at MIT now maintains and distributes thousands of BioBrick\u2122 standard biological parts. However, BioBrick parts are only standardized in terms of how individual parts are physically assembled into multi-component systems, and most parts remain uncharacterized. Standardized tools, techniques, and units of measurement are needed to facilitate the characterization and reuse of parts by independent researchers across many laboratories.ResultsWe found that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments. We choose one promoter (BBa_J23101) to serve as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity. We demonstrated that, by measuring the activity of promoters relative to BBa_J23101, we could reduce variation in reported promoter activity due to differences in test conditions and measurement instruments by ~50%. We defined a Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units and developed a measurement kit so that researchers might more easily adopt RPU as a standard unit for reporting promoter activity. We distributed a set of test promoters to multiple labs and found good agreement in the reported relative activities of promoters so measured. We also characterized the relative activities of a reference collection of BioBrick promoters in order to further support adoption of RPU-based measurement standards.ConclusionRelative activity measurements based on an in vivoreference standard enables improved measurement of promoter activity given variation in measurement conditions and instruments. These improvements are sufficient to begin to support the measurement of promoter activities across many laboratories. Additional in vivo reference standards for other types of biological functions would seem likely to have similar utility, and could thus improve research on the design, production, and reuse of standard biological parts."

This protocol is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes and is performed by simply subjecting a mix of 10 undigested input plasmids (nine insert plasmids and the acceptor vector) to a restriction-ligation and transforming the resulting mix in competent cells. The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity. This protocol, that we call \u2018Golden Gate shuffling\u2019, is robust, simple and efficient, can be performed with templates that have no homology, and can be combined with other shuffling protocols in order to introduce any variation in any part of a given gene.",

We reasoned that transformation-associated recombination (TAR) could be employed to clone large DNAs containing repeat sequences, thereby eliminating the need for in vitro enzymatic reactions such as restriction and ligation and reducing the amount of DNA handling. Gently isolated human DNA was transformed directly into yeast spheroplasts along with two genetically marked (M1 and M2) linearized vectors that contained a human Alu sequence at one end and a telomere sequence at the other end (Alu-CEN-M1-TEL and Alu-M2-TEL). Nearly all the M1-selected transformants had yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA inserts that varied in size from 70 kb to > 600 kb. Approximately half of these had also acquired the unselected M2 marker. The mitotic segregational stability of YACs generated from one (M1) or two (M1 and M2) vector(s) was comparable, suggesting de novo generation of telomeric ends. Since no YACs were isolated when rodent DNAs or a vector lacking an Alu sequence was used, the YACs were most likely the consequence of TAR between the repeat elements on the vector(s) and the human DNA. Using the BLUR13 Alu-containing vector, we demonstrated that human DNA could be efficiently cloned from mouse cells that contained a single human chromosome 16. The distribution of cloned DNAs on chromosome 16 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We propose that TAR cloning can provide an efficient means for generating YACs from specific chromosomes and subchromosome fragments and that TAR cloning may be useful for isolating families of genes and specific genes from total genome DNA."

In the early 2000's, a new philosophy emerged aiming at applying the principles of engineering: abstraction, standardization and quality control, to the Genetic Engineering. Tom Knight, from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, published a report entitled \"Idempotent Vector Design for standard Assembly of BioBricks\" [5]...Standard biological parts called \"BioBricks\" are pieces of DNA that form a functional unit such as promoters, coding sequences, terminators etc. They can be combined with vectors that allow assembling these parts in the desired order applying consecutively the same standardized techniques. The combination of different parts makes a \"device\" and several devices a \"system\".

Abstraction refers to dissecting the design procedure into several hierarchies as an effective way to handle complexity. The division of the engineering process into several more straightforward abstraction levels (DNA, parts, devices, and systems) allows designers to work at a specific level somewhat independently to build a part, device, or system. Modularity or decoupling is the degree to which a system can be separated into \"functional blocks\" or orthogonal components. Functional blocks can be combined to construct modules with different functionalities that do not interact with each other. Finally, standardization aims to provide tools and protocols to ensure predictability and reproducibility in biological experimentation."

                            "One of the most efficient tools of synthetic biology is the Biobrick system, based on the use of standardized genetic parts that can be easily assembled to create new biological systems [3]. The Biobrick standard, developed by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, has since become a widely accepted standard in the field of synthetic biology [3]. Biobrick are DNA sequences that include promoters, coding sequences, and terminators, which are the basic building blocks of genetic engineering [3]. They are similar to electronic components in that they can be used to create complex systems by combining them in different ways. The Biobrick system also includes an archive of available genetic parts and a set of standard protocols for assembling and testing these parts [3]. One of the main benefits of using Biobrick is that they are exchangeable, meaning that they can be used in different biological systems without requiring significant modification [3]. This allows for the rapid and efficient construction of new biological systems, as well as the ability to test different combinations of parts to optimize performance [3]. Additionally, Biobrick are well-characterized, meaning that their function and behavior have been thoroughly studied and tested, which allows for greater predictability and reliability when building new systems [4]."

                            "Despite the common use of restriction enzymes, ligase and cloning vectors, Genetic engineering lacked the standardization of other engineering disciplines. In the early 2000's, a new philosophy emerged aiming at applying the principles of engineering: abstraction, standardization and quality control, to the Genetic Engineering. Tom Knight, from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, published a report entitled \"Idempotent Vector Design for standard Assembly of BioBricks\" [5]",
                            "Standard biological parts called \"BioBricks\" are pieces of DNA that form a functional unit such as promoters, coding sequences, terminators etc. They can be combined with vectors that allow assembling these parts in the desired order applying consecutively the same standardized techniques. The combination of different parts makes a \"device\" and several devices a \"system\". This standardization gave birth to the \"Synthetic Biology\", a discipline that can be defined as the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes [6]."

We will use the definition of a biological 'component' as a protein, protein domain, or nucleic acid sequence and a 'part' represents a process or system that performs a particular function. A module represents a functional combination of parts with defined inputs and outputs, while a circuit represents the entire system of parts and modules. Within this framework, biological parts are the key functional units for building circuits (Anderson et al., 2019). A significant aim for synthetic biology is the development of circuits de novo using a range of standardized, interoperable parts, which has led to the development of parts lists (Cameron et al., 2014) such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition repository (http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page) [55]."

For example, a promoter library was used to ascertain rules that describe the responsiveness of a promoter to transcriptional factors [98]. Specifically, promoters were sub-divided into the core, proximal and distal regions. For prokaryotes, the strength of transcriptional repression was shown to be the greatest when a repressor site was located in the core region of a promoter. The repression strength was less strong when located in the proximal region and was the weakest when located in the distal region. Conversely, activators worked only in the distal region and had no effect in the core and proximal regions [99]. These basic principles could be exploited to assemble promoter modules in a bottom-up approach."

                            "BackgroundThe engineering of many-component, synthetic biological systems is being made easier by the development of collections of reusable, standard biological parts. However, the complexity of biology makes it difficult to predict the extent to which such efforts will succeed. As a first practical example, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts started at MIT now maintains and distributes thousands of BioBrick\u2122 standard biological parts. However, BioBrick parts are only standardized in terms of how individual parts are physically assembled into multi-component systems, and most parts remain uncharacterized. Standardized tools, techniques, and units of measurement are needed to facilitate the characterization and reuse of parts by independent researchers across many laboratories.ResultsWe found that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments. We choose one promoter (BBa_J23101) to serve as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity. We demonstrated that, by measuring the activity of promoters relative to BBa_J23101, we could reduce variation in reported promoter activity due to differences in test conditions and measurement instruments by ~50%. We defined a Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units and developed a measurement kit so that researchers might more easily adopt RPU as a standard unit for reporting promoter activity. We distributed a set of test promoters to multiple labs and found good agreement in the reported relative activities of promoters so measured. We also characterized the relative activities of a reference collection of BioBrick promoters in order to further support adoption of RPU-based measurement standards.ConclusionRelative activity measurements based on an in vivoreference standard enables improved measurement of promoter activity given variation in measurement conditions and instruments. These improvements are sufficient to begin to support the measurement of promoter activities across many laboratories. Additional in vivo reference standards for other types of biological functions would seem likely to have similar utility, and could thus improve research on the design, production, and reuse of standard biological parts."

For example, promoters, repressors, and reporters can be used again and again in disparate studies with the hope that each part will perform consistently. This has led to the creation of a parts registry [62] and a database where increasing numbers of biological parts are added (Galdzicki et al., 2011).

Although a few intrinsic prokaryotic transcription terminators are used routinely, termination efficiencies have not been studied systematically. Here, we developed and validated a genetic architecture that enables reliable measurement of termination efficiencies. We then assembled a collection of 61 natural and synthetic terminators that collectively encode termination efficiencies across an \u223c800-fold dynamic range within Escherichia coli. We simulated co-transcriptional RNA folding dynamics to identify competing secondary structures that might interfere with terminator folding kinetics or impact termination activity. We found that structures extending beyond the core terminator stem are likely to increase terminator activity. By excluding terminators encoding such context-confounding elements, we were able to develop a linear sequence-function model that can be used to estimate termination efficiencies (r = 0.9, n = 31) better than models trained on all terminators (r = 0.67, n = 54). The resulting systematically measured collection of terminators should improve the engineering of synthetic genetic systems and also advance quantitative modeling of transcription termination."

The SBPkb allows researchers to query and retrieve standard biological parts for research and use in synthetic biology. Its initial version includes all of the information about parts stored in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (partsregistry.org). SBPkb transforms this information so that it is computable, using our semantic framework for synthetic biology parts. This framework, known as SBOL-semantic, was built as part of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), a project of the Synthetic Biology Data Exchange Group. SBOL-semantic represents commonly used synthetic biology entities, and its purpose is to improve the distribution and exchange of descriptions of biological parts. In this paper, we describe the data, our methods for transformation to SBPkb, and finally, we demonstrate the value of our knowledgebase with a set of sample queries. We use RDF technology and SPARQL queries to retrieve candidate \"promoter\" parts that are known to be both negatively and positively regulated. This method provides new web based data access to perform searches for parts that are not currently possible."

Looking beyond gene editing, the redesign of simple genetic parts, usually as single components in a construct, such as promoters, has been the most frequent embodiment of synthetic biology. At its core, synthetic biology should be capable of endowing extensive and transformative changes to organisms by leveraging advanced computational design to build synthetic DNA constructs and then large-scale installation of many genetic components into plant genomes at once or in series.

                            "Recent developments in synthetic biology and gene editing technologies have created new possibilities to control cell behavior through the engineering of genetic networks that respond to environmental stimuli. Synthetic biology involves the design and assembly of genetic circuits to create new biological functions. By understanding the native genetic circuits that are usually optimized via evolution and reconstructing them from modular design, bioengineers can use synthetic biology to build systems with novel activity. (Polizzi, 2013) In the early stage of synthetic biology, simple gene circuits could be built to be precisely executed to recapitulate patterns of certain natural biological systems in bacteria, such as oscillating gene expression networks, multistate toggle switches, logic computation, and intercellular signaling networks. (Elowitz et al., 2000)(Gardner et al., 2000)(Hasty et al., 2002) Following these early successes, significant progress has been made, such as new modular genetic parts with standardized design and connectivity principles to streamline the construction of novel circuits with greater complexity. (Khalil et al., 2010)(Purnick et al., 2009) However, most of the early success of synthetic biology is performed in prokaryotic cells, while it remains difficult to directly transfer the methods into eukaryotic cells due to the complexity of the genetic networks. With the discovery of more precise genome engineering tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, researchers have begun to interrogate and control gene function and network dynamics in eukaryotic cells. (Cong et al., 2015) CRISPR/ Cas9 allows precise targeting of specific genome loci. When genetically engineered to pair with functional domains, this precise control has enabled the construction of multilayered gene circuits with higher-order functions in mammalian cells.

                            "An important goal of synthetic biology is the rational design and predictable implementation of synthetic gene circuits using standardized and interchangeable parts. However, engineering of complex circuits in mammalian cells is currently limited by the availability of well-characterized and orthogonal transcriptional repressors. Here, we introduce a library of 26 reversible transcription activator-like effector repressors (TALERs) that bind newly designed hybrid promoters and exert transcriptional repression through steric hindrance of key transcriptional initiation elements. We demonstrate that using the input-output transfer curves of our TALERs enables accurate prediction of the behavior of modularly assembled TALER cascade and switch circuits. We also show that TALER switches employing feedback regulation exhibit improved accuracy for microRNA-based HeLa cancer cell classification versus HEK293 cells. Our TALER library is a valuable toolkit for modular engineering of synthetic circuits, enabling programmable manipulation of mammalian cells and helping elucidate design principles of coupled transcriptional and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation."

Coupled with novel DNA assembly methodologies such as Gibson assembly (Gibson et al., 2008), we have overcome the limitations of conventional cloning methods to enable the seamless assembly of combinatorial genetic parts, thus elevating our assembly capacity. Consequently, synthetic biologists can now even assemble entire chromosomes from chemically synthesized DNAs (Gibson et al., 2008)(Richardson et al., 2017).

                            "The first wave of synthetic biology focused upon the combination of basic elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites and transcriptional repressors to form modules with specified behaviours. Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes (Lienert et al., 2014)(Black et al., 2017). Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches (Gardner et al., 2000), pulse generators (Basu et al., 2004), oscillators (Tigges et al., 2009) and digital logic gates (Rinaudo et al., 2007). These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation",
                            "Thanks to the advances in systems biology as well as the emergence of new powerful tools that allow scientists to synthesise and create DNA, we are no longer limited to physical DNA samples isolated from organisms (Kong et al., 2007)[11](Kartalov et al., 2004). The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells."

This protocol is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes and is performed by simply subjecting a mix of 10 undigested input plasmids (nine insert plasmids and the acceptor vector) to a restriction-ligation and transforming the resulting mix in competent cells. The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity. This protocol, that we call \u2018Golden Gate shuffling\u2019, is robust, simple and efficient, can be performed with templates that have no homology, and can be combined with other shuffling protocols in order to introduce any variation in any part of a given gene."

                            "DNA molecules undergoing transformation into yeast are highly recombinogenic, even when diverged. We reasoned that transformation-associated recombination (TAR) could be employed to clone large DNAs containing repeat sequences, thereby eliminating the need for in vitro enzymatic reactions such as restriction and ligation and reducing the amount of DNA handling. Gently isolated human DNA was transformed directly into yeast spheroplasts along with two genetically marked (M1 and M2) linearized vectors that contained a human Alu sequence at one end and a telomere sequence at the other end (Alu-CEN-M1-TEL and Alu-M2-TEL). Nearly all the M1-selected transformants had yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA inserts that varied in size from 70 kb to > 600 kb. Approximately half of these had also acquired the unselected M2 marker. The mitotic segregational stability of YACs generated from one (M1) or two (M1 and M2) vector(s) was comparable, suggesting de novo generation of telomeric ends. Since no YACs were isolated when rodent DNAs or a vector lacking an Alu sequence was used, the YACs were most likely the consequence of TAR between the repeat elements on the vector(s) and the human DNA. Using the BLUR13 Alu-containing vector, we demonstrated that human DNA could be efficiently cloned from mouse cells that contained a single human chromosome 16. The distribution of cloned DNAs on chromosome 16 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We propose that TAR cloning can provide an efficient means for generating YACs from specific chromosomes and subchromosome fragments and that TAR cloning may be useful for isolating families of genes and specific genes from total genome DNA."

However, the current cost of de novo synthesis\u2014driven largely by reagent and handling costs\u2014is a significant barrier to the widespread availability of such technology. In this work, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first gene synthesis in a microfluidic environment. The use of microfluidic technology greatly reduces reaction volumes and the corresponding reagent and handling costs. Additionally, microfluidic technology enables large numbers of complex reactions to be performed in parallel. Here, we report the fabrication of a multi-chamber microfluidic device and its use in carrying out the syntheses of several DNA constructs. Genes up to 1\u2009kb in length were synthesized in parallel at minute starting oligonucleotide concentrations (10\u201325\u2009nM) in four 500\u2009nl reactors. Such volumes are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those utilized in conventional gene synthesis. The identity of all target genes was verified by sequencing, and the resultant error rate was determined to be 1 per 560 bases."

                            "One of the important challenges in the emerging field of synthetic biology is designing artificial networks that achieve coordinated behavior in cell communities. Here we present a synthetic multicellular bacterial system where receiver cells exhibit transient gene expression in response to a long-lasting signal from neighboring sender cells. The engineered sender cells synthesize an inducer, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which freely diffuses to spatially proximate receiver cells. The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP. Based on simulation models, we engineered variants of the pulse-generator circuit that exhibit different quantitative responses such as increased duration and intensity of the pulse. As shown by our models and experiments, the maximum amplitude and timing of the pulse depend not only on the final inducer concentration, but also on its rate of increase. The ability to differentiate between various rates of increase in inducer concentrations affords the system a unique spatiotemporal behavior for cells grown on solid media. Specifically, receiver cells can respond to communication from nearby sender cells while completely ignoring communication from senders cells further away, despite the fact that AHL concentrations eventually reach high levels everywhere. Because of the resemblance to naturally occurring feed-forward motifs, the pulse generator can serve as a model to improve our understanding of such systems."

Currently entering its third decade [12], synthetic biology has achieved a remarkable level of maturity, paving the way for ground-breaking advances in designing increasingly complex systems. Increasingly powerful DNA synthesis and recombination tools also enable the field to consider conceptualizing and manipulating much larger 'modules' of function (e.g. multiple genes in a metabolic pathway), or even whole bacterial (Fredens et al., 2019) and eukaryotic cells (Richardson et al., 2017)."

Here, we present a general and scalable platform entitled \u2018biomolecular implementation of protocellular communication\u2019 (BIO-PC) to engineer distributed multichannel molecular communication between populations of non-lipid semipermeable microcapsules. Our method leverages the modularity and scalability of enzyme-free DNA strand-displacement circuits to develop protocellular consortia that can sense, process and respond to DNA-based messages. We engineer a rich variety of biochemical communication devices capable of cascaded amplification, bidirectional communication and distributed computational operations. Encapsulating DNA strand-displacement circuits further allows their use in concentrated serum where non-compartmentalized DNA circuits cannot operate. BIO-PC enables reliable execution of distributed DNA-based molecular programs in biologically relevant environments and opens new directions in DNA computing and minimal cell technology.Semipermeable proteinosome membranes allow complex DNA message communication through compartmentalization and protect the DNA circuits from degradation in a biological environment."

                            "Directed evolution, the laboratory process by which biological entities with desired traits are created through iterative rounds of genetic diversification and library screening or selection, has become one of the most useful and widespread tools in basic and applied biology. From its roots in classical strain engineering and adaptive evolution, modern directed evolution came of age twenty years ago with the demonstration of repeated rounds of PCR-driven random mutagenesis and activity screening to improve protein properties. Since then, numerous techniques have been developed that have enabled the evolution of virtually any protein, pathway, network or entire organism of interest. Here we recount some of the major milestones in the history of directed evolution, highlight the most promising recent developments in the field, and discuss the future challenges and opportunities that lie ahead."

This encompasses diverse applications, from engineering new or improved activities in enzymes, heterologous production of commodity chemicals, assembly of genetic parts in a synthetic manner and developing cellular therapies. Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s",
                            "These technological advancements have since led to the creation of a vast and ever-growing catalog of cellular components and their interactions which, in-turn, has enabled a bottom-up approach to designing regulatory networks and circuits that can be used for the biosynthesis of various biochemical products (e.g., proteins and metabolites). Moreover, the modular components within this catalog can be assembled and tested to identify combinations that yield further advantages beyond each individually. One such modular component, a genetic toggle switch, was engineered into Escherichia coli in the early 2000's, which resulted in the creation of the first synthetic biological system. This breakthrough paved the way for further advances such as bacteria that produce biofuels or cells programmed to target cancer cells."

These platforms have accelerated innovation by fostering knowledge exchange and establishing communities of practice around standardized biological parts and expression systems.\n\nThe comparative advantage of synthetic biology approaches over traditional protein expression methods lies in their ability to apply quantitative modeling to predict how introduced DNA and protein sequences will interact with host systems <Paper corpusId=\"208841247\" paperTitle=\"(Kallam et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This predictive capability, combined with the precision and modularity of synthetic biology tools, has transformed protein expression from an art to an engineering discipline, enabling the design and construction of biological systems with unprecedented efficiency and reliability.",

First applied to microorganisms it has enabled the industrialscale production of beneficial, bio-based products such as pharmaceuticals, flavourings and textiles. It is now advancing to multicellular organisms. In plants, the field is still in its infancy, yet the potential for plants as light-powered, sustainable biomanufacturing platforms is tremendous",

                            ". Standardized DNA parts encoding regulatory elements can be designed and rapidly assembled in multiple combinations with enzymes that catalyse existing precursors into new compounds. These high-performance pathways can then be introduced to cells. In addition, genome engineering tools such as those derived from bacteria CRISPR/Cas9 systems can be used to remove genes from the host that encode products that use or break down the products of the new pathway. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the application of quantitative modelling is starting to inform how the design of new DNA and protein sequences inserted into host cells will influence their interactions with each other and with molecules present in the host to affect yield."

Although a few intrinsic terminators and RBSs are used routinely, their translation and termination efficiencies have not been systematically studied in Actinobacteria. Here, we analyzed the influence of the regions surrounding RBSs on gene expression in these bacteria. We demonstrated that inappropriate RBSs can reduce the expression efficiency of a gene to zero. We developed a genetic device \u2013 an in vivo RBS-selector \u2013 that allows selection of an optimal RBS for any gene of interest, enabling rational control of the protein expression level. In addition, a genetic tool that provides the opportunity for measurement of termination efficiency was developed. Using this tool, we found strong terminators that lead to a 17\u2013100-fold reduction in downstream expression and are characterized by sufficient sequence diversity to reduce homologous recombination when used with other elements. For the first time, a C-terminal degradation tag was employed for the control of protein stability in Streptomyces. Finally, we describe a collection of regulatory elements that can be used to control metabolic pathways in Actinobacteria."

This encompasses diverse applications, from engineering new or improved activities in enzymes, heterologous production of commodity chemicals, assembly of genetic parts in a synthetic manner and developing cellular therapies. Although synthetic biology itself is a relatively new field that emerged in the early 2000's, the tools required to engineer living systems were under development for decades before the field of synthetic biology was officially founded and its roots can be traced all the way back to the discovery and development of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s",

Moreover, the modular components within this catalog can be assembled and tested to identify combinations that yield further advantages beyond each individually. One such modular component, a genetic toggle switch, was engineered into Escherichia coli in the early 2000's, which resulted in the creation of the first synthetic biological system. This breakthrough paved the way for further advances such as bacteria that produce biofuels or cells programmed to target cancer cells."

Much of these early studies focused on the engineering of circuits within bacterial hosts owing to their robustness and low complexity, relative to eukaryotes (Lienert et al., 2014)(Black et al., 2017). Gaining inspiration from electronics, these relatively simple systems include multistate genetic toggle switches (Gardner et al., 2000), pulse generators (Basu et al., 2004), oscillators (Tigges et al., 2009) and digital logic gates (Rinaudo et al., 2007). These early successes within a simpler network has inspired synthetic biologists to make significant progress in developing a wider range of modular genetic parts that have a more standardised design and connectivity principles. This allows the construction of novel circuits with a greater complexity to be streamlined, allowing the programming of diverse cellular behaviours such as transcription, translation and post translation",

The improvement in this technology allows for the construction of larger DNA molecules such as plasmids, pathways, and whole genomes. This has made it possible to build and study more complex systems with desired features. In parallel, the advancement of computational tools has also given scientists an opportunity to model various possible outcomes and provide a better prediction of the outcome prior to construction. Thus, the ability to synthesize both DNA and proteins in vitro allows the building of pathways for value-added molecules as well as artificial cells."

                            "One of the important challenges in the emerging field of synthetic biology is designing artificial networks that achieve coordinated behavior in cell communities. Here we present a synthetic multicellular bacterial system where receiver cells exhibit transient gene expression in response to a long-lasting signal from neighboring sender cells. The engineered sender cells synthesize an inducer, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), which freely diffuses to spatially proximate receiver cells. The receiver cells contain a pulse-generator circuit that incorporates a feed-forward regulatory motif. The circuit responds to a long-lasting increase in the level of AHL by transiently activating, and then repressing, the expression of a GFP. Based on simulation models, we engineered variants of the pulse-generator circuit that exhibit different quantitative responses such as increased duration and intensity of the pulse. As shown by our models and experiments, the maximum amplitude and timing of the pulse depend not only on the final inducer concentration, but also on its rate of increase. The ability to differentiate between various rates of increase in inducer concentrations affords the system a unique spatiotemporal behavior for cells grown on solid media. Specifically, receiver cells can respond to communication from nearby sender cells while completely ignoring communication from senders cells further away, despite the fact that AHL concentrations eventually reach high levels everywhere. Because of the resemblance to naturally occurring feed-forward motifs, the pulse generator can serve as a model to improve our understanding of such systems."

However, the current cost of de novo synthesis\u2014driven largely by reagent and handling costs\u2014is a significant barrier to the widespread availability of such technology. In this work, we demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first gene synthesis in a microfluidic environment. The use of microfluidic technology greatly reduces reaction volumes and the corresponding reagent and handling costs. Additionally, microfluidic technology enables large numbers of complex reactions to be performed in parallel. Here, we report the fabrication of a multi-chamber microfluidic device and its use in carrying out the syntheses of several DNA constructs. Genes up to 1\u2009kb in length were synthesized in parallel at minute starting oligonucleotide concentrations (10\u201325\u2009nM) in four 500\u2009nl reactors. Such volumes are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those utilized in conventional gene synthesis. The identity of all target genes was verified by sequencing, and the resultant error rate was determined to be 1 per 560 bases."
